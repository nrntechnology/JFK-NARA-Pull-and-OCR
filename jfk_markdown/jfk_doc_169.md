SUBJECT: - Operational Plen for Continu! Lng
mo Operet tons Against Cubs

3, Action: This memorandua is for your inforastion

‘gnd pursuant to your request, Recommendations for action rra

contained ia Parugraph V below. The purpose of this memersinns:

‘ia to ecolineste an operational pina for the action which we
" believe should be taken by CIA ogainst Cuban fur the predictahls

future, In‘ guamary the plan provides for ccntinuing, even
intensifying, the intelligence effort egeinst Cubs and for
the reorientation of the current effort into » long tern

denied area type of operation of the highest priority.

I, ASSUMPTIONS:
‘A. The United States Government will give public
assurances that, provided no nuclerr or offeusive weapers = 2r

present or re-introduced into Cuba, end provided Cubr deer

not take netdon to threaten the perce. -ond security of tke |

14-00000

® These assurances will preclude eny ‘meaningful CIA
action ‘on a phesed basis to provoke a revolt inside Cubz, sinve
unless there are major changes in operational and internal con-

- ; ditions: in Cuba, such a revolt if provoked would be totally

deatroyed Py Cuban counteraction in aR. matter of hours or, ot

es a practical matter will, preclude invading Cuba on the pretext
‘of a contrived provocation such as en attack on Guantanamo.
2Ce CIA operations: involving a. high noise level anda
* diaeadet ‘elenent of ‘attributability, particularly paramilitary,
" guerrilly,. and conmande type operations will. be unacceptable
as a matter of ‘policy.
De The Castro-communist regime will remain in power for
‘the indefinite. future, with its security and coatrol apparatus
relatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing
, unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational
. conditions 1a Cuba increasingly difficult. While it. is
possible that recent and future developments including the
Soviet action in renoving the offensive weapons from Cube nury
serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there is as yet no hard
indication that the control of the Castro-coanunist regime over
“ae ‘uhd toca rabetactity weakenod, .

., The _Vaited States assurances of no invasion and no

- support of: an invesion will, in effect, constitute giving tc
Castro and his regime a certain degree of sonctuary. This will

14-00000

{ i’ severely denoge the aorale and motivation of anti-regine Cubene
| both inside sad. outside of Cuba, ‘which will make it ineresaingiy
‘ : “ dattioult for us to. recruit agents, maintain agents already
recruited, and. continue or intensify our intelligence and other
efforts against Cuba and the Castro-communist regine.

objective ita the overthrow of the Castro-conmunist regime.
“This is an unrealistic objective, however, except.on a very
.  long-tera, basis as tie. Uaited States Government, we believe,
. jc ~ will be unwilling in the. immediate future to commit troops
’ to support such, an overthrow. The United States Governnent
in its overt dealings with the Cuben exiles probably will not
"express. ‘the above factors to them in the context or with the
bluntness: stated here,
. /G. In view of these factors, the so-called “Irzck Tro",
. course of action, 4.6., unlimited support of Cuban exiles
and exile ETOUpS. with no real control or objective purposes

in the hope that ‘these groups will be able to shake the

_ Castro regiae will, although unrealistic, become _increzs ing ty

attractive at various levels in the United Sta tes Government.

; H. As & matter of policy, political pressures end
"economic pressures short. of blocksde,. raids, sad | aggressive

sabotage against Guba: will be continued.

14-00000

qr. Fi view of the above assumptions prramilitary, command

and sabotage. operations, except in rare selective instonces

will serve Little purpose; also they will be counter-procuct tye
since, it. ‘undertaken, they will make the collection of intelli.
gence more ditzionlt and should. only be undertrken in those very

' few instances. where an unusually high return can be demonstreted,

Regardless of what other pressures are placed on CIA for
tection against Cuba, it would eppear clear that Higher Authertiy

. wa insist on os continued, . even intensified, tatelligence

coverage of Cuba.
J, ‘In view ot the policy factors, an iacreased use of

factlities,’ veal estate sod basing outside the United States,
:° particularly in’ Latin Auerics, will be both necessary snd
desirable. ,

Adequate aerial reconnaissance of Cuba will continue.

" presks down under nunerous ‘gub-beadings the intelligence
coverage which has been developed. by the Clandestine Service.
Set out below aro specifics of operational action it is
proposed to take to continue and, as possible, increase ne
telligence coverage of Cube.

1. fatelligence Exploitetion of Refugees: As you
know, with the quarantine and the cessation of sir
braver t the heavy’ flow of Cuban refugees haa dwindled

e almost to nothing. In view of this and in connection
yes

with the contingency pilenning for supporting any persibis
mjiitary sotion in Cube, the Opa-Locks Interrogation - )

Canter as auch was disaantied, : although. the personnel

of. the Center have been retained intact. In order to
- re-astablish. the flow of intelligence from refugees,
it is. proposed that. Pan Auerican Airveys and KLY be
* taducea to. ‘relnatitute their: regular’ flights from

Havana to Miams.’ This should be done as scon a3

" possible after the settlement of the current nogotizttons

and UN discussions. Coincident with this, _the Opa~Locka
vefugee’ interrogation center will be re-established

, with the sane personnel.

- Resident Agents in Cuba: Every effort will be

‘aade to continue to exploit to the fullest, preserve the

viability of and, where necesssry, re-establish commimica-

' tieas: with the isi recruited agents now resident in Cube.
To an ‘extent, the speed and effectiveness of this effort
_ wll of course depend upon the stringency of future

Cuban security snd control action, which it is impossible

as yet to accurately forecast.

3. Third Country Operations: The priority on re-

cruiting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cubs

will be reiterated gnd strengthened and every effort

. is will be made to jucreage. this coverage, both through

“the dsvelopaent of additional resident agents in ‘Cuba

this will be done through legal travel channels, but
