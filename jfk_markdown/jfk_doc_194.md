1, A meeting was held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.

Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications

of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.

It was concluded that additiona information was required on

03 Thomas L. Roberts) and Robert Delson)?’I contacted the Director
Security and requested the security files on these two individuals

: and was advised that we could not. have the security files but that

Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss

their contents openly, : :

932, On 29 January, Mr. Greene brought the security files.
on(B oberta>and (Delsén) and was most cooperative in explaining
their contents. Attached is a chronological rundown on the
pertinent information on (Thomas L. Roberts) affiliation with
the FBI, CIA and Itkin. oS

3. On 30 January,a meeting was heldwith Messrs, Houston,
Warner, Rocca, and(Eugene Milligan CCS (LBGLOBE, to discuss
the operational use of Mr. (Robertae3 Mr S%{Robert9 has been a

Novembe 9q1964 he spent time in(West Africa) writing a monograph

4, The facts in the attached chronology are subject to
question since they are the result of (Robérte own explanation of
his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from
independent sources. The most critical aspect would appear to
be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of

3 Roberta) affiliation with CIA. This knowledge is borne out by
the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly bringé (Roberts) name
into:the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations. ~
One of the questions, to be answered by LBGLOBE personnel is
whether or not (Robert? reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva,
Switzerland, in March 1966, There appears to be no record of
03(Roberts') having explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or
what his financial contribution was to the (law firm of Itkin, Roberts
and Greenbaum.) 08

.5. Mr. Rocca was advised:by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI -
that the New York District Attorney may be conaidering prosecution
against Roberts)for having abeconded with funds received from
negligence cases. We do. not have sufficient information to evaluate
the likelihood of criminal prosecution, It may be necessary to
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

6. With regard to Robert Délson) there appear to have been
two operational considerations, one having been a request to use
him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations
Division for his use on Project,WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO
Division advised Security that (Deleon) was not going to be used

_ on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca commented that there are some rather &

ominous allegations against members of the firm of @®elson, Levin
and Gordon) indicating that one member of the firm was a card-
carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time
Mr. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR use of Mr. (Delson,)
