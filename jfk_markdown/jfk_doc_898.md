: 2. Alfreda ABELL, who. was a clerk in the UN Secretariat. :
from 1947 until 6/30/52 when her employment was terminated for security

Secretariat for security reasons, were reported in October 1952 to
xvyequently return to the UN premises where they were said to oftan

Communists. According to a confidential FBI informant, ABELL in

March 1952 made a check payable to KAGAN in the amount of $150, and

4, At a Senate Internal Security Subcommittee hearing in

New York City in late 1952, Alfreda ABELL refused on grounds of self-
incrimination to say whether she was then or ever had been a communist,
whether she tried to “organiza UN workers, or whether since leaving the
UN in the Simmer of 1952 she had revisited UN headquarters in the role
of a communist organizer. The FBI continued to have an interest in
ABELL until at least Tecenber 1962, the date of an FBI réport in her.

_. Dear Mr. Lesar:

Be This acknowledges receipt of your letter of 11 June 1976
on behalf of Mr..Harold Weisberg requesting, under provisions |
of the Freedom of Information Act, access to any CIA records

. dealing with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and/or James Earl Ray |
and any of his alleged or suspected accomplices in Dr. King's

assassination. °

I shall arrange for a search of CIA files and shall be in’.
further communication with you once the search has been completed
and any records found reviewed for releasability under the Act.

As you may ‘know, the heavy volume of Freedom of Information
requests received by the Agency has resulted in processing back-
logs. If we do not respond within the 10 working days stipulated
by the Act, it is your right to construe this as a denial, subject
to appeal to the CIA Information Review Committee. It would seem
more reasonable, however, for us to continue processing your request
and to respond as soon as feasible. Any denials of records could.
be appealed at that time. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we
will. assume that this is agreeable to you and proceed on this basis.

For your information, I am enclosing a copy of our fee schedule.
If the charges seem likely to be considerable, I shall provide you
with an estimate and perhaps require a partial payment in advance
of processing
Sincerely,

‘dealing with James Harl Ray and any of his etleged or suspected

We find that: we are unadle to respond te , your request as at

of personal information from-official records. In that Light, -
please be advised that we can proceed-neo further with your request.
unless and until we are in receipt of notarized statements of re-
lease from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray, respectively.
These statements should be quite specific as to what areas of
personal- information are and are not authorized for release by this
Agency to.-you and your client. If all information in cur records _
is releasable, that shoutd be se stated; if only such information |
as relates to specific incidents er to specific periods of tine is
releasable, these caveats sheuld be clearly stated. ;

Finally, we must ask that you provide a statement of willing
ness to pay search and duplicdtion fees as required by this request
and in line with the fee schedule enclosed. It has been estimated
. that such charges could approach $1998. Along with the notarized

statements above, and the statement of willingness to pay all search
and copying charges (or those up. to an established limit}, we would
require a down payment of half the anticipated charges. Payment
should be wade to this office in the fora of a check or money order a

‘Dear Mr. Wilson: ; ce oe

In response to your letter of November 30, 1976, Mr. Harold
Weisberg has authorized me to state his willingess to pay search -
and copying charges up to the amount of $1,000 if such charges are
_vequired by his Freedom of Information Act request for records
pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his assassination.

Because you require a down payment of half the anticipated charges,
rt enclose a check for $500. 90:

“This ‘payment of $500. 00 and any subsequent payments made in
connection with this request are tendered with the express resexyva-
tion that Mr. Weisberg does not waive his right to recover then

C.I.A. regulations provide:

Records shall be furnished without charge

or at a reduced rate whenever the Coordina-
tor determines that waiver or reduction of
the charge is in the public interest because
furnishing the information can be considered
as primarily benefiting the general public.
The Coordinator also may waive or reduce the
charge whenever he determines that the inte-
rest of the government would be served there-~
by. 32 C.F.R. §1900.25(a).

In accordance with this regukatibn, I call upon you to
determine that it is in the public and governmental interest to
waive search and copying charges incurred in connection with Mr.
Weisberg's request. Enclosed herein is a copy of a letter to Deputy
Attorney General Harold R. Tyler, Jr. which makes a similar request
of the Department of Justice. The reasons expressed in that letter

_ for. granting a waiver are incorporated in my request that you grant
a waiver.

Should you require it, I will provide you with affidavits by
myself, Mr. Weisberg, and others in support of this request for a
waiver of the search and copying charges for these records. If you
do wish supporting affidavits, I would appreciate it if you would

inform me of this as soon as possible. I would also request
that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established |
for determining whether or not a request for waiver should be

You state that you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's
request “unless and until we are in receipt of notarized state-
ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray,

’ respectively." Because Mr. Weisberg's request undoubtedly com-

prises records which do not involve any proper claim of privacy,
this cannot be true. I do enclose, however, .a copy of a notarized.
waiver by James Earl Ray. I will immediately contact Mrs. King ~
about a waiver by her. In the meantime, I request that you proceed
to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's re-
quest which do not involve any proper claim of invasion of privacy.

Gated May 1956. Previous editions of this newspaper appeared in the
Pairvanks area in carly 1955, but it was discontinued after publica-

* @ «#"But we can be destroyed when wa lose faith or hops end when life -
itoelf seens like a story told by a nad man, as it mast seca to the
members and supporters of the White Citisena Council......

the Negro people of the South have been rerking tino, naking
excuses and accepting conditions thet exist in the South. Until a few
brave men in Alabama turned what seened to be « tragedy into an opper-
tunity by having courage enough to challenge the Jim Crow laws."# # @

Quoted’ below is a portion of an editoriai uncer the caption "The Longest
Picket Line in the World", aiso appearing in the May 1956 publication of .
the Alaskan Labor Defender: .

* # # 'Every union local, every worker in office, factory or work-
oop, must make it a personal obligation to take action now! Thie is
no time for passing the buck! Tnie is the tins to collect i¢ and send
it to the Montgomery Improverant Association, care of tne (hey, Me. Le

The above statement was issued by By Presidential
candidate of the Socialist Workers Party, and ‘refers to the 50,000 °
Negroes in Montgomery, Alabama who are in'a struggle against Jin Crow
on the buses of that city." # # #
2 # @# Actually the struggle goos deeper end wider than that. The
present wave of race terror and hatred in the South is being fanned by
the White Citisens Council. What is not gensraily known is that this
terror is directed against any white workere who dare to colidarise
with Hegroes. The murderous White Citisens Council are not only rebidly
Jim Grow but Anti-semitio and Anti-labor. (neir aim is to preserve .
the systea of color segregation and siscrimination as the foundation 7
upon which rests the open shop structure of the "Right to Work” South®. « # «

‘a dead man, .

Early thig year, one of these instruments came into my hands. | resolved to use
it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. | set about collecting every recording ! couid lay my hands on

_ recorded testimony of twenty-two persons—eyewitnesses, Daltas policemen, the

pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,

Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren. .
"| ran the tapes through the PSE systematicaily, taking each controversial point in
turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?

Was Oswald the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-
graphs which the Warren Commission never saw-—do they support the Commission's
fone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?
Did its mambers conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture | expected. Not
all the details are there, but | guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory
of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark
Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.

The PSE is not a crystal ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function

for historical research. To understand what | did with.the PSE, one should know some-
thing about the device itself. .

I first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when | met two of
its inventors, Alian D. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, both
former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army intelligence several. years ago to form
a company called Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. It was a logical second
career for the two men. Both are experts in the. technology of espionage. Either one
could pick the lock on your front door in less time. than it takes you to find your
key. Colonel Bel! wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and
small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit, from anti-bugging devices

experts intheU.S.,a specialist in radio and audio surveillance, and a qualitied locksmith.

African country. The instructor was Mike
Kradz, a criminologist and retired police
officer. Kradz projects the tough-cop
image, but he is a living rebuttal to the Po-
lisn joke. Tiere is nothing about forensic
science, from fingerprints to po!ygraphy. on
which the man is not an caper.

The first morning of the course was

devoted to the physical operation of the the interrogation. This can produce irrele- _

PSE. Tne device is used.in conjunction with
a Uher tape recorder. whicn has ‘our speeds
and can be manually wound back to locate
a particular point on the tape. The testimony
to be evaluated is recorded at a tape speed
of 7% inches per second, therrpiayed back
and stopped at the beginning of the utter-
ance in question. The recorder is slowed
to 15.16 inches per second and piayed. The
sound, no longer recognizable as a human
voice, is a long, low rumbie. :
Tha PSE itselfis built into an attaché case.
‘The case opens to reveal a chart drive. sim-
ilar to an electrocardiograph, and a number
of buttons and knobs. A single cable con-
nects the PSE to the tape recorder.
As the tape recorder reels slowly tum,

and a rumbie issues from its speaker, the
PSE stylus dances back and forth across

the moving chart paper, leaving behind a “guilt complex responder.” Such a person .. -

ragged trail. Then the recorder is stopped,
the chart paper is stopped, and that's all
there is to it. The result is a strip of paper
with a squiggly line. The rest is up to the
human eye and brain. .
On the afternoon of the first day, Kradz
showed us what to look for. The unstressed
voice looks like an untrimmed hedge, with
stalks of different heights sticking up (and
down) at irregular intervals. But add some
stress, and that hedge begins to look

trimmed. The greater the stress, the

smoother the shape. If the subject was
experiencing the hard stress which accom-
panies deception, the over-ai outline of the
figure tends to take on a rectangular shape,
a concertina as seen by the player. Kradz
showed slide after slide of charts made dur-
ing actual police interrogations. He told us
the background of each case and pointed
out the tell-tale signs of deception, when-
ever they were present.

That night each student took a PSE back
to his room to practice operating it. Some
coordination must be learned to become
facile in handling the recorder and the PSE,
but clearly the difficult part of the course
would be learning how to read and interpret
the charts.

Sary for the examiner to interview the sub-
ject before the examination, go over atl of

the subject he will ask only these questions.

. Thad reason to remember this later, when

tran my first reat interrogation tape. —~
The interrogation always includes the
question, “Are you afraid that | will ask you

about something we have not discussed?"

A negative answer with no sign of stress
eliminates the outside-issue problem. Also,
the examiner always asks some innocuous
questions, such as, “Do you fike the color
blue?” in order to observe the subject's
general state of tension. And there is always
one “red-herring” question.

The red herring is used to identify the

accusatory question. The examiner may
ask, “Did you steal the watch?” when it is

by asking the “outside-issue” question. No,

Kradz would ask him a question they hadn't

“Are you wearing a white shirt?”
“Yes.” -
“Do you know who took the money?”
“No.”

“Are you wearing a ring?” -
“Yes.”

“Did you take the money?”
“No.”

There were a few rad-herring questions
to check for the. guilt comptex response.
The questions about wearing a white shirt
and a ring and living in Howard County had
been included to measure the background
stress elicited by irrelevant issues. -°-

situation, 1 wondered if it could be used
the way | had hoped, as a tool for historical
research.

During the lunch break ! took Kradz aside
and asked him. Could the PSE be used out-
side interrogations, where the speaker was
telling what may or may not have hap-
pened? Yes, he said, the PSE could be used
for that. Where there was no stress, | could
be confident that the speaker was telling
the truth. However, when | did find stress,
\had to be very careful about reaching con-
clusions about its cause; it could result from
something other than deception. But if |

found a stress pattem in the testimony of

several witnesses to the same event, | would
very probably have uncovered deception.

Encouraged, ! reviewed the list of recent
mysteries. Watergate was, of course, the
first to come to mind. The ITT affair was
also of recent interest. The Kent State inci-
dent had never been fully cleared up. But
one subject seemed to loom above all the
rest—the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Like many others, | have found it difficult

thad despaired of ever leaming the truth. -

Now | knew what to do with the PSE. .

It was all there: the statements made
before television cameras by eyewitnesses,
policemen, medical examiners, members
of the Warren Commission. Somewhere in
a network-television vault were the sound
tracks, with the tiny, inaudible variations in
voice frequency that could settle once and
for all the question, “Did Oswald, acting
alone, shoot and kill John F. Kennedy?”

My immediate problem was getting

access to the recordings. ! was certain the
television networks would have them, but
1 wasn’t sure exactly what to ask for. There:
must be thousands of hours of sound
recordings relating to the assassination.
Where, among all this talk, was the critica!
testimony?

is nat always present.

! ontained a tape recording from CBS
News of a portion af a Sixty Minutes program
in which Mike Wallace interviewed Clifford
Irving. The interview took place during the
height of the controversy, while Irving was
still claiming to have gotten Howard
Hughes life story through a series of inter-
views with the billionaire. It was a consum-
mate job of lying, embellished with such
convincing details as Irving's disagreement
with his colleague Susskind about whether

’ Hughes kept his organic prunes in a paper

or a piastic bag. Sixty Minutes re-ran the
segment after Irving's confession because
the man’s sheer virtuosity as a prevaricator
was amazing. | was interested in the inter-
view for a different reason: at the height
of the’ controversy, Irving had been given
a polygraph examination and had passed

it. !wanted to see if the man.who had beaten °

the conventional lie detector could also
beat the PSE.

{selected a point in the interview at which
Mike Wallace suggested that Irving had not.
interviewed Howard Hughes, but had hap-
pened on some transcripts of Hughes’ state-
ments: Irving asked how he could have hap-
pened on them. Wallace rejoined, “Where
did you happen on those transcripts?” Irv-
ing replied, “I got the transcripts from
Howard Hughes.” | charted this statement
on the PSE. ;

it was a perfect example of total stress,
horizontally blocked, with the smooth,
“trimmed-hedge” wave form. Clifford Irving
was a master liar, and he had beaten the
polygraph, but he would have been caught
by the PSE.

A tew days after our first meeting, 1!
received a call from Bob Smith. He had
turned up a few things for me. | visited him
at the Committee's office in downtown
Washington. He gave me a tape recording
and a typewritten transcript. The recording
was the Louis Lomax television program of
Sunday, October 16, 1966. Wesley Liebler,
a member of the Warren Commission's staff,
was the guest. The transcript was of a CBS

-News television program entitled The War-

ren Report, which had been broadcast in.
four one-hour segments on June 25, 26, 27
and 28, 1967.

| examined the transcript. The programs
had been narrated by Walter Cronkite and
other CBS newsmen. They reviewed every
major point of controversy that had been
raised by the critics of the Warren Report,
inierviewing eyewitnesses, Dallas police-
men, medical examiners. ballistic special-
ists and many others who had some inside
knowledge of the assassination of John F.
Kennedy. For what { had in mind, it was
a gold mine. | telephoned CBS and learned
that | could get. a copy of the program's

Next | played the Lomax-Liebler tape.

Apparently Mark-Lane had betn onan --

eariier Lomax program, and sow Liebler ©
was on to rebut him. | didn't need the PSE -
to nnow that Liebler was stressed. He
seemed very agitated, and his breathing .
audibly indicated his tension. He was angry
about the things Lane had said, the ques-
tions Lomax was asking him. and the reac-
ticn of the studio audience. Given his highly
emotional! state, he did not seem a very
promising subject for the PSE. Nonetheless, ~
| decided to give it a try. 7

Charting a tape with the PSE is a tong
and tedious process. and it was impractical
to chart the entire program: ! ran some of
Liebler's statements which were not in dis-
pute and discovered, as 1 had expected.
a great deal of stress. He was pretty
charged up.

Most of the exchange between Liebier,
Lomax and the audience was. argumenta-
tive and did not deal with specific factuat
points. t found two key statements by Lieb-
Jer, though, and | charted them.

The first statement, iri response toa ques-
tion by Lomax, was, “I have no doubt about
the conclusions of the [Warren] Report."
Plenty of stress was evident, but not much .
more than in other statements.

The second statement related to those
Warren Commission documents which were
not included in the Report—they were —
locked up in the National Archives. Lomax
asked Liebler if there was anything in the
documents which wouid alter Liebler’s
opinion. Taken literally, it was a strange
question, since Liebler had seen the docu-

‘ments and, if they would alter his opinion,

they would already have done so. Lomax
probably meant to ask if the documents
would conflict with the conclusions of the
Warren Report. Whatever Liebler thought
the question meant, he answered quickly,
“Oh, none, none at ail.” The PSE showed
much more stress here than during any of ..
Liebler's other statements.

resuit of his predicament, and Garrison's
might also be the result of some outside
issue. The situation was ambiguous.

t ran the testimony of Lee Odom. Odom,
a Dailas businessman, was attempting to
explain the mysterious coincidence of the
post office box numbers. It seems that the
Dalias post office box number 11906

Shaw and Lee Harney Oswald. In his tes-

Oswaid’s notebook, he knew how it got inta

he had given it to Shaw. whom he'd met
by chance on a business trip to New
Orleans. The PSE showed hard stress dur-
ing his statement. No unrelated control
statement was available for me to run for
comparison.

This didn’t really clear things up. There

were several obvious alternative explana: -

tions for Odom's stress. For example, there

unrelated to the Garrison charges. Odom
may have felt extremely uncomfortable
about linking himself to this man in any way.
The coincidence of the box numbers
seemed very suspicious, but Bob Smith of
the Committee had pointed out to me that

‘both Snaw's and Oswald's notebooks were
_ filled with numbers, so the chance of such

a coincidence was not that remote.

my mind to rest on this point: the PSE had

He was asked it Garrison had known of cer-

had alleged were being used by Garrison's

Obviously | did not have enough tes- . ,

that, at the very least. Garrison did not have
much of a case against Shaw (a view later
held by a New Orleans jury) and likely that
Shaw was completely innocent of complic-
ity in the assassination. The lesson of this

episode is twofold. First, stress .in any one-

person's testimony does not prove decep-

tion. Second, given enough testimony by .

Gifferent witnesses, the PSE can arrive at

‘the truth.

The first person | ran on. the PSE who had
any direct knowledge of the assassination

was Oswald's widow, Marina. Unfortu--

nately, only one of her statements was on

the C8S tapes—that Oswald had owned a :

ritle. The PSE said she was telling the truth.
The rifle had been one of the major points

of controversy raised by critics of the War-

ren Report. The debate centered on two

points: whether the Mannlicher-Carcano ~

alleged to have belonged to Oswald was
the rifle found by the Dallas police in the

Texas Schoo! Book Depository, andwhether * ~
that particular gun could have been the mur-

der weapon.
On the tapes, Darrell C. Tomlinson, an
employee of Parkland Hospital, testified

that he had found a rifie buliet ona stretcher .

which he believed had carried Governor
Connally. There was no stress in, his state-
ment. The PSE said he was telling the truth.

Dr. Joseph DO. Nicol, Superintendent of
the Bureau of Criminal! investigation for the
State of litinois. ran ballistic tests on bullet
fragments found in the presidential timou-
sine, and on the intact bullet found by Tom-
linson. Nicol testified that both the intact
bullet and the bullet fragments had been
fired by the Mannlicher-Carcano. He. too,
was apparently telling the truth.

Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman of

the Dallas police claimed that he found
Oswald's Mannticher-Carcano on the sixth

floor of the Texas School Book Depository. -

However, on the day of the assassination,
he had told the press that the rifle he'd found
was a German Mauser. The following day

-he signed an affidavit to that effect. But on
. the CBS tapes he testified that he had been
mistaken about that point, that it had really

he second tink between Oswald and the
assination is the charge that he killed
cer Tippitt. a Dallas policeman, while
‘ing from the scene of the first shooting.
umber of eyewitnesses have testified
:they saw Oswald shoot Tippitt, and one
them, Domingo Benavides; was inter-
ved on the CBS tapes. He was asked
vere was any doubt in his mind that
vald was the man he saw shoot Tippitt.
replied, “No, sir, there waa no doubt
ull.” There was absolutely no stress in
statement. He was telling the truth.

he killing of Officer Tippitt by Oswaid
fueled the fires of controversy over the

rren Report. Tippitt was far from his usual-

it when he was shot. Some witnesses
e alleged that Tippitt and Oswald were
n together in Jack Ruby's nightclub.

lied, “I don't think he knew Oswald.” Did

2 of these witnesses was a railroad
ker named S.M. Holland, wha observed

PENTHOUSE

The PSE confirmed that he thought he had
seen a puff of smoke on the knoll, but it
could not support his claim that he had
heard a shot from that direction.

Another witness, Charles Brehm, was
quoted by Mark Lane as having said that
he had seen a portion of the President's
skull flying back over the ‘eft rear end of
the limousine. Lane offered this as evidence
of a shot from the grassy knoll. On the CBS
tapes, Brehm stated heatedly that he had
been quoted out of context, and emphatic-
ally denied that any shots had come from
the knoll. Despite his emotional state, there
was almost no stress in this statement.

Officer Jacks of the Dallas police, who
was riding in the limousine of Vice-
President Johnson, denied that any of the
shots had come from the direction of the
grassy knoll. The PSE turned up a fair de-
gree of stress.

Three witnesses, Mrs. Caroline Walther,
Arnold Rowland and Howard Brennan,
claimed to have seen gunmen in the win-
dows of the Texas School Book Depository
building. Mrs. Walther said she saw two
men, one armed with a rifle, the second

‘with a shorter gun. Rowland told the Warren

Commission he had seen two men, one an
elderly Negro, in the window Oswald is
alleged to have fired from, but on the CBS
tapes he claimed he had seen an armed
man ata differant window. The Commission
relied heavily on the testimony of Brennan,
who claimed to have seen a gunman in the
“Oswald window" actually firing the last of
the shots. The PSE showed hard stress in.
the testimony of all three witnesses.

The PSE analysis of the eyewitnesses’
testimony regarding the source of the shots
is ambiguous. It supports Holland's claim
to have seen a puff of smoke on the knoll,
and Brehm's denial that any shots came
from that direction, and it raises serious
doubts about all other claims and counter-
claims. This contradiction seems to result
from the notorious unreliability of eyewit-
nesses, perhaps compounded by a fair
amount of fabrication. Deception, if it is
present here, may have been motivated
merely by a desire for attention. Or there
may have been: darker reasons.

There is, however, other evidence and
testimony that could shed some tight on the
existence, number and location of assas-
sins other than Oswald. This brings us to
perhaps the most dubious and controversial
element in the Warren Commission's ver-
sion of the event—the autopsy.

nedy had been rushed to the emergency
room at Parktand Hospital, where Dr. Mal-
coim Party tried to save his life. The physi-

cian saw that the President had suffered —

a massive head wound and a smaller wound

in the throat. Perry performed a tracheos- .

tomy, cutting through the throat wound in
an attempt to open a breathing passage.
Afterward, when hope for the President had
been abandoned, Perry met with the press
and deciared that the wound in the front
of the neck had been an entry wound.
The President's body was flown to
Washington, D.C. There, approximately
eight hours after the shooting, an autopsy
was performed at Bethesda Navat Hospital.

Because of the tracheostomy, the nature of ~

the neck wound could no longer be ob-
served and was, at first, overlooked. Later,
after consulting the Dallas doctors, the

Bethesda pathologists concluded that it |

was an exit wound. The autopsy report
stated that there were two entry wounds,

-one tow in the rear scalp and one at the

right base of the neck; and two exit wounds,

‘the throat wound and a large irregular

wound on the right side of the head.
The confusion was compounded when
two FBI agents present at the autopsy

feported that a wound had been found in”

the President's back, and that no corre-
sponding exit wound had been located.

Diagrams made during the autopsy seemed ©

to confirm this, showing the lower of the
two entry wounds to be below the shoulders,
not at the base of the neck. What became

‘of the bullet? The agents reported that |

Bethesda doctors thought the bullet had
dropped from the wound when the Dallas
doctors attempted extemal heart massage.
But this was the shot that the Commission
claimed had passed through Kennedy and
struck Governor Connally.

. X-rays and color photographs of the au-
topsy were made. The brain was removed

from the body. Brain and skin tissue slides .

were prepared for microscopic examina-
tion. Remarkably, the Warren Commission
mever asked to see any of this evidence,
relying instead solely on the testimony of
Captain James J. Humes, one of the
pathologists who conducted the autopsy.
Even more incredible is the disappearance

of the brain, the slides, and some of the ~

photographs, which were alleged to have
been tumed over to the National Archives
by the Bethesda Naval Hospital.

Both Or. Perry and Captain Humes were
interviewed on the CBS tapes. Perry was
asked about the throat wound he’d seen
when the President was brought to Parkland
Hospital. His answer seemed evasive. He
neither confirmed nor denied that he had
thought it was an entry wound, talking in-
stead about the difficulty of making such
a determination and the fact that his atten-
tion had been devoted to saving the Presi-
dent's life. Then the interviewer asked him
Girectly whether he had thought at the time

that it was an entry wound. “Actually, ididn't

teally give it much thought,” he replied. He

formed to whitewash the facts.

The PSE said he was telling the truth.

John McCloy. a member of the Warren
Commission, said much the same thing,
and added that he had seen no credible
evidence to contradict the findings of the
Commission. The PSE backed him up on
this. bit it failed to do so when, speaking
of the Warren Report, he said, “There was

former Chief Justice Earl Warren himself.

which was part of a series called The Bran-
deis Television Recollections. Bob Smith of
the Committee provided me with the tape.

The interview was an hour long, but the
Kennedy assassination and the Warren
Commission came up only once. The inter-
viewer, Abram Sachar, Chancellor of Bran-
deis University, was friendly and deferen-
tial. | charted. some of Warren's remarks
unrelated to the assassination and found
that he was generally unstressed. Sachar
raised the subject of the Commission
obliquely, and Warren volunteered several
rather lengthy statements about it
. Warren said that immediately after the as-
sassination there were two theories, one that
Khrushchev and Castro were behind the
killing, the other that a group ot right-wing
Texas oilmen were responsible. He said:

“We explored both of those theories for
ten months and found no evidence that
either of them was involved in it.”

The PSE showed hard stress.

He continued:

. we found no evidence of any kind

that’ there was any conspiracy.”

Again there was stress, and particularly |
hard stress on the words “no evidence.” .

_ “lhave read everything,” said Justice .

Warren, “that has come to my notice in the

he continued, “to change my view, norhave -

The stress was hard. As | had now’ come -

to expect, the word “nothing” seemed a
particularly beautiful example of stress.
Another word seemed to show even more

Stress: “member.” Could he have been

had charted the last of the assassination
tapes. Of course, these few thousand feet
of recording tape are only a small fraction’
of the relevant testimony recorded and
stored away in the archives of television
news departments. There is, for example,
Lee Harvey Oswald, as he was led through
the Dallas police station, denying that he
had killed the President. There are state-
ments by Marina Oswaid, Jack Ruby and
by others. ;

| have no doubt that with these tapes,

What, given the sample of testimony §
have processed with the PSE, can! say
about the assassination? -

We should first examine the testimony in
whichno stress was found, since itis almost
certain that these people were telling the
truth as they saw it. This strongly suggests
the following:

1. Oswald owned a rifle.

2. A bullet fired from that rifle was found
on Govemor Connally's stratcher at Park-
land Hospital.

3. Bullet fragments alleged to have been
found in the presidential limousine also
came from Oswald's rifle.

4. At least one eyewitness believes he
saw gunsmoke on the grassy knoll, but
another is equaily certain mo shots came.
from that direction.

5. Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippitt.

6. At least one member of the Warren
Commission and one member of the Com-
mission's staff really believe in the’ validity
of the Warren Report.

7. Jim Garrison had little or no cage

er.who had ever changed his mind
their conclusions.

muicates Gecepuon, an Hileresing ang
unexpected possibility emerges:

Oswald was involved in some way in the
assassination, if only as a fall guy. Some of
the Dallas police force may have been in-
volved, planted the evidence that impli-
cated Oswald, and covered up the fact that
there was a conspiracy. The medical exam-
iner believed his own testimony to the War-
ren Commission, but tater had doubts. The
Commission found evidence of a conspir-
acy but didn’t believe it, so they covered
it up in order to present a tidy package to
the public. Later, at least one member of
the Commission changed his mind, but
since he didn't know what really did hap-
pen, he decided to say nothing. So there
was conspiracy in Dallas, and in Washing-
ton nothing worse than blundering.

{ could say all this with certainty if! knew
that stress always equals deception. Unfor-
tunately, | do not know that. But the PSE
analysis of the assassination tapes has
generated a staggering amount of fresh
doubt regarding the Warren. Report. This
doubt rises not only from specific points
the PSE has called into question, but from
the very sinister implications of the very
existence of deception among policemen,

government officials and Commission
members. The question remains: did such
deception exist or was the stress found by
the PSE the result, in every © case, of an out-
side issue? |

me dt ana Cannot be cross-Checked by

a structured interrogation, some; probability ,

must be accepted that this stress'is caused
by an outside issue. No study has yet been

conducted to establish what this probability ,

might be, but let us pick, for the sake of
discussion, a figure that may seem tidicu-

lously high—-70 percent. in other words, we ~" -

are assuming that 70 percent of the times
the PSE finds stress in testimony, it results
from something other than lying. .

Now, let's ignore the deception indicated : .
in the testimony of the eyewitnesses; evan |.
if present, it might have resulted from mara -

desire for attention. That leaves eight “in-

siders" who have demonstrated stress when -

making statements supporting the Warren

Report: the Dallas policemen Hill, Jacks,

_iner, Captain Humes; Commission staffer. ~

‘Wesley Liebler, Commission member John

McCloy; former Chief Justice Earl Warren.

’ Assuming that there is a 70 percent —si«y.
chance that any single instance of stress
is “outside issue,” what Is the probability . -

that all eight instances are due to factors
other than deception? Elementary proba-
bility theory tells us that it is seven-tenths
raised to the eighth power, or approxi imately
& percent. - :

in other words, even making some fairly

Attachment to CIR-316/03107-73

SUBJECT: Conference of the Committee to Investigate Assassinations,
Report on Proceedings 23 November 1973

1. The Committee to Investigate Assassinations claims to
have been established in 1969. The headquarters are in Washington, D.C.
(at 1520 16th Street, N.W.). In the four years of its existence the
Committee has done research and has become a kind of clearing
house for the study of assassinations. It maintains contact with
other groups engaged in similar activity, of which there seem to be
at least two, one of which is located in the Boston area,

2. In addition to research, the Committee acts to help
individuals interested in the investigation of assassinations. It thus
files suits for private persons demanding access to classified
information. It sponsors the publication of books and articles
relating to the field of its interest, and sponsors the production of
movies. It publishes a newsletter.

3. The conference of November 23-24, 1973, is the first of
its type to be held by the Committee. The Georgetown University
was helpful by placing Gaston Hall at the disposal of the Committee
free of charge. By agreement with the University, the Committee
will also be able to use the services of the University Library as a
repository and research center.

4. The Conference opened on November 23, 1973, with a delay
of about half an hour. The delay may have been due to the installation
of recording equipment which literally covered the premises with a
tangle of wires of every kind. The Washington Post reports an
attendance exceeding 300. This is a generous estimate. After
deducting official speakers, recording personnel, and press

‘representatives, the audience probably numbered no more than 150,

if that many.

5. Beards and long hair prevailed, and others stood out like a
sore thumb. There was not a single Negro in the audience, nor, that
morning, on the platform. Even the speaker who spoke on the case
of Martin Luther King was white.

6. Not all the speakers preannounced were present. The
chairman announced the absence of Richard Sprague. Another
speaker, a lawyer from Los Angeles whose name was drowned
out in the noise, was also absent. They were replaced by Dr. Robert
Forman and someone whose name sounded like ''Ed Kirkley".

7. The chairman announced that all the speeches would be
tape recorded for subsequent publication. He further invited the
audience to attend movies to be shown that night. One of these,
"Burn", was to be shown at the University. Others by prearrangement
would be shown at local movie theaters, The latter were connected
with the Kennedy assassination. The case of the President's murder
was in the center of the conference and, as noted by one of the
organizers (Smith), one half of the speakers were to center their
attention upon the Oswald case.

8. The chairman adhered strictly to the program and every
speaker mentioned in the program for the morning session of
November 23 spoke as specified. Of those who spoke, Norman
Mailer, Robert P. Smith and Ronald Van Doren deserve particular
attention, Their speeches in summary are reviewed below.

9. A table at the back of the audience presented recommended
literature. The books included H. Weissberg's Whitewash and
Peter Noyes' Legacy of Doubt. For some reason there was a copy
of one paper only, that of George O'Toole's ''Assassination Tapes",
There was also a bibliography of political assassination; the foreword
to which lists the persons most actively collaborating with the
Committee.

SECRET

OLUNEI

10, A publication circulated during the conference was the
November, 1973 issue of Computers and Automation which is to

be renamed, starting January 1, 1974, Computers and People.

The publication of articles such as ''Nixon and the Mafia'' which
concludes that Richard M. Nixon seems to be the embodiment of

a prediction that organized crime would someday put its own man

in the White House, seems somewhat curious in a magazine devoted
to the profession of data processing and the use of computers,

The magazine was established in 1951 by Berkeley Enterprises in
Massachusetts. Alger Hiss is among its contributors and an
abundance of articles by Richard Sprague on the subject of Watergate
published in the past year. ,

ll, Another organization which received publicity at the
Conference was The Committee for Action/Research on the
Intelligence Community (CARIC).

12. <A representative of Computers and Automation handed out
this publication free of charge to members of the audience. He took
notes with fantastic speed and apparent accuracy of everything said
during the proceedings.

13. The lights gave out at one point and did not come on again
during the morning session. The absence of current may have
affected the tape recording. .

14, The morning session, due to close at 12:30, ended after
1:30 p.m. By this time the audience was impatient to have lunch,
and the resumption of the proceedings was therefore postponed to a
later hour. .

15. No document of any kind was issued to the persons who
paid $15.00 to enter. Instead their hand was stamped with the name
of the organization which gave them access to all further meetings
that day and the next (the members of the audience were apparently
not supposed to wash their hands during this time). Names were
taken down, but no questions asked other than one's initial. No
information on address, occupation, etc. was required.

‘ 16. Speech by Norman Mailer. This was beyond a doubt, the
most striking presentation during the Friday morning session.
Mailer spoke briefly and left the conference shortly after the speech.

17... Mailer said that political intelligence as a subject was as
‘powerful as "peace". Interest in assassination is obsessive. The
obsession arises from the fact that a solution to the problem is not
found, and attention is constantly drawn back to the unanswerable
question.

18. He said that we have here the most powerful nation in the
world which cannot come to grips with a question which seems as
amazingly simple as the Kennedy assassination. The result has
been that this nation has decided to shut down investigation and has
thus alienated itself from its own history. This alienation has
brought apathy, a trait noticeable in the reaction to investigations
which bring no wide response.

19. A nation which rejects its own history is on n the path toa
totalitarian regime, Facts, meanwhile, have a peculiar ability to
change when they are investigated, and investigators must therefore
rely upon hypothesis, The history of the last ten years has been
made unendurable by the abundance of hypotheses. They range
from the opinion that an assassination is an accident lacking any
particular sequence to the hypothesis that secret police forces are
engaging in a world conspiracy. .

20. The present conference must help us to learn whether
there are possibilities, and what Possibilities exist, to solve these

questions.

21. Speech by Robert P, Smith. Mr. Smith was described as

the director of research of the Committee, but he seems to be one
of the major motive forces in this organization,

22. Mr. Smith pointed out that he had spent the last three years
studying the Kennedy case. Much research had been done, but ;
nothing had changed, so far as practical action was concerned, in
the last nine years.

ee ar ree me ne ne ere ce

27. Speech by Ronald Van Doren. Mr. Van Doren seems to be a
follower of Governor Wallace. He began by commenting on the sad ;
situation in a country with a judiciary where individuals have to make
conjectures regarding a case as obvious as that of Bremer. There is
no doubt that Bremer pulled the trigger. But one should examine the
political situation at the time of his action. Wallace was by far the
leading candidate in the election campaign, a threat to other candidates,
and he was winning the nomination. He represented a challenge to
both parties. Nothing he said could be interpreted as racist, and in
the economic sense he carried wide appeal. The question which faced
the other candidates was how he could be stopped from disrupting the
two parties and from preventing the re-election of the President.
History will show how he was stopped and why this occurred,

28. The case in defense of Wallace's civil rights was quietly
dropped. No proper investigation was conducted. As usual in
assassination cases there was a diary. It showed that Bremer was
acting alone and was deranged. Read as a piece of literature, the
diary presents Bremer as a non-person, an illiterate unable to spell,
There is nothing regarding the people he worked with. Meanwhile, if
one examines Bremer's background, he appears an entirely different
person. Why did he travel repeatedly to Ottawa? How did he manage
to carry guns on planes? What was he doing in New York? Why was
he in Washington? And where did he get his funds? The apartment
he rented exceeds his annual income. His mother could not afford
to visit him in prison, yet he dressed well. With whom was he

. involved?

29. All this should be looked into. Watergate brought the
electoral campaign to the fore. Why has discussion of the Bremer
shooting been excluded from the investigation? Bremer.was a part
of the 1972 campaign, yet there is no mention of Wallace or of
Bremer. Two years from now Wallace will be back.

30. Speech by Ms. Meredith Rode. Ms. Rode was very brief.

She said she became interested in the killing of George Lincoln Rockwell

in 1970, and that the case was built on circumstantial evidence exclusively.
The case is still open, for the police believe that there was an accomplice.

No funds are available for defense. ca

SECRET
SECRET

23. Although the National Archives are the repository for the
Kennedy assassination documents, the FBI and the CIA are
responsible for restricting research. Much of the 300 cubic feet
of documents have been printed, a reclassification in 1971 has
released 3,000 pages, and the CIA later released more, but none of
the material released has created any sensation. The Freedom
of Information Act is not as liberal on assassination material as on
other matters. Some material was not even turned over to the
Warren Commission. The FBI and the Justice Department are alone
in knowing the results of some tests.

24, ‘In the non-governmental area, much has been published,
and the book by Peter Noyes must be singled out particularly.

25. Speech by Mr. Robert Hanson, Mr. Hanson has become

the counsel for Sirhan Sirhan. He studied to become an engineer
and then shifted to law. (To judge from the number of cases which
he says he has lost, heshouldhave remained an engineer instead of
becoming an attorney. }

Mr. Hanson said that the Sirhan case is pretty hopeless.
The trial was based on a 100 per cent belief in Sirhan's guilt,
Therefore important witnesses were not called, and no attention
was paid to ballistics. Scientific study, however, indicates that
Sirhan Sirhan may not even have been the person who committed
the crime, But even if it is proved that his gun did not kill
Robert Kennedy, this discovery may have no influence upon Sirhan's
case. California officials have no desire to reopen the case and
funds to handle the proceedings are lacking. A book by Tiger on
the case is worthy of note. Tiger claims that Sirhan Sirhan was
acting under hypnotic influence.

26. Speech by James Lesar. Mr. Lesar, who spoke on the

Martin Luther King assassination, declared that Ray was innocent,
and that the FBI and the Justice Department were responsible for
wrongly solving the crime. Ray was framed by conspirators. The
persons presently involved in Watergate played a role in the Ray
case investigation. No private agency - only a government agency -
can solve the Ray case. All depends on whether the judiciary acts
honestly or with political consideration in mind. As it stands today,
we see Ray's rights having been abominably violated; we see lawyers
who did not do their job; and we see nothing approaching an open

‘hearing.

31, There was also a speech by Robert Salzman who was
long-winded and technical. No useful coverage available.

Senator John Stennis, Chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, will begin hearings early in the
New Year on his Bill No. S.2597 -- to amend the National
Security act -- in regard to clarification of the
authority of the CIA. .

The bill recently introduced by Senator Stennis
resulted in part from correspondence with Senator Edmund
Muskie, Chairman of the Senate Disarmament Subcommittee.
To some degree, these hearings were inspired by the
Watergate developments.

ve sity has refused to establish a committee within the legislative
-och, Now, in the midst of the Watergate scandals, there is some
“ment within Congress to establish committees on the separate

stelligence agencies. The result will be diviced oversight with no |

taimance that Congress will be able to stop illegal and unjustified
pring. With Congress abrogating its responsibilities, there is no agency
41 savernment, directly responsible to the public, monitoring ‘the
Jictad States Intelligence Community.

Mow former intelligence workers and concerned citizens have
oried a national association to provide the vita’ information an aware
tie needs 10 know about government onerations. The Committee for
\stion/Research on the tntelligence Community (CARIC) is an
atopendent “watchdog” on the government spy apparatus. CARIC,
pausored entirely by donations from American citizens, serves as an

Nernative source of analysis and informacion on the practiccs,.
wnization and objectives of U.S. Intelligence. What clandestine ~

perrations are being carried out in the name of America? Is the CIA

+uaring to entangle us in another war simitar to the Indochina, War?
‘hat information is going into Federal, State, local and private data
cits an innocent American citizens? Is the F3! becoming a “secret
chine force?” Whose phones are tapped in America? These are some of
ly: cucstions CARIC is answering.

ZARIC knows that all conscientious Americas are closely watching
1. svents that have unfolded since the arrests made at the Watergate
sling. We share the hope of most Americans that the illegal
2 Practices that have now been exposed will no longer be a part
nerican political life. However, the dismar.tling of one espianage
“wal loyal to one croup of politicians dees net insure that this abuse
wapsier wll not ba repeated by future politicians,

Who knows what future political espionage will occur under the
guise of so-called “national security” or loyalty to an administration?
Only time willl tell, but through diligence and your help CARIC will
anticipate and bring to your attention situations within the government
that are likely to produce a new “Watergate.”

Although CARIC does believe that a massive government spy
apparatus is at work in the world, we hope to dispel some of the
paranoia citizens naturally feel when there is talk of spies and wiretaps.
We know that the FBI does not have agents behind every. tree, but thera
are agents in every major community in this country who have spicd on
innocent private and public citizens. Only a full and undisguised look
into this hidden world can displace unwarranted fears, and guide the
public effort to end this illegal and unjustified espionage. The secrecy
with which the government surrounds itself must end.

CARIC knows that tens of thousands of American citizens from all
walks of life were mobilized over the past decade to help bring an end
to the government's war in Indochina — a war that has taken new forms
under the direction of U.S. Intetligence agencies. CARIC hopes that
these same concerned citizens will continue to oppose the policies of
our government which bring this new form of covert war and the
Watergate scandals. It is now time for thousands of Americans to
mobilize to stop the spying as we stopped the dying. Please join us in
our effort.

THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:

THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTERS
TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE oy

, ta

Part 1. Introduction

Who Assassinated President Kennedy?

On November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, President
John F. Kennedy, while riding in an open limousine
through Dealey Plaza and waving to the surrounding
crowds, was shot to death. Lee Harvey Oswald, an
ex-Marine, and former visitor to the Soviet Union,
was arrested that afternoon in a movie theatre in
another section of Dallas; that night he was charged
with shooting President Kennedy from the sixth floor
easternmost window of the Texas School Book Deposi-
tory Building overlooking Dealey Plaza. This act
Oswald denied steadily through two days of question-
ing (no record of questions and answers was ever
preserved). Two days later while Oswald was being
transferred from one jail to another, he was shot
by Jack Ruby, a Dallas night-club owner, in the
basement of the Dallas police station, while mil-
lions of Americans watched on television. The com-
mission of investigation, appointed by President
Lyndon B. Johnson, and headed by Chief Justice Earl
Warren of the U. S. Supreme Court, published its
report in September 1964, and concluded that Oswald
was the sole assassin and that there was no conspir-
acy.

In view of the authority of the Warren Commis-
sion, that conclusion was accepted by many Americans
for a long time. But the conclusion cannot be con-
sidered true by any person who carefully considers
the crucial evidence — such as the physics of the
shooting, the timing of a number of events, and
other important and undeniable facts. In other
words, Oswald was not the sole assassin, and there
was a conspiracy.

This article will develop that thesis, prove it
to be true on the basis of substantial, conclusive
evidence, and in particular some analysis of the
photographic evidence. ©

There was in fact a conspiracy. Oswald played
a role in the conspiracy, although there is con-
clusive evidence that on November 22, 1963, he did *
no shooting at President Kennedy, and that, just
as he claimed when he was in the Dallas jail, he
was a "patsy." At least three gunmen (and proba-
bly four) — none of whom were in the sixth floor
easternmost window of the Texas School Book Depos-
itory building where the Warren Commission placed
Oswald — fired a total of six shots at President
Kennedy.

One of these shots missed entirely; one hit
Governor John B. Connally, Jr. of Texas, riding
with Kennedy; and four hit President Kennedy, one
in his throat, one in his back, and two in his

head. (The bulk of the undeniable evidence for
these statements about the shots consists of:

(a) the physics of the motions of Kennedy and Con-
nally shown in some 60 frames of the famous film
by Abraham Zapruder; (b) the locations of the in-
juries in Kennedy and in Connally; and (c) more
than 100 pictures, consisting of more than 30
still photographs and more than 70 frames of mo-
vies.) :

More than 50 persons were involved in the con-
spiracy at the time of firing the shots. These
persons included members of the Dallas police force
(but not all of the Dallas police — and that ac-

The magazine Computers and Automation has for more
than three years followed an unusual publication policy:

— The pursuit of truth in input, output, and pro-
cessing, for the benefit of people,

and an unusual belief:

— That computers are too important to be left to
computer experts and must be integrated into a
socially responsible profession of information
engineering. .

Whttecthis policy has operated most is in publishing
information, articles, and reports on subjects which a
great many liberal and progressive newspapers and peri-
odicals have left unexplored or unmentioned:

— The politicat conspiracies which have led to the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Sena-
tor Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and
others — and their coverups

— The conspiracies, coverups, and lies in connection
with the pursuit of war in Indochina and dictator-
ship by the Saigon regime

— The connections of President Richard M. Nixon
with organized crime and the Mafia

=~ The Watergate crimes

If you believe in the value of truthful, frank reporting
on the most important topics for the welfare of the
people of the United States today, we urge you to sub-
scribe to our magazine, and buy our back copies (almost
every one is in print). Please help us pursue the important
truth and report on it, by buying our products.

THE PURSUIT OF IMPORTANT TRUTH

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical ...

Computers and Autometion, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine inthe field of come
puters and deta processing, believesthat the pro-
fession of informstion engineer includes not only
competence in handling information using computers
and other means, but also a broad responsibility,
in a professional and engineering sense, for:

— The reliability and social significance of
pertinent input data;

— The social value and truth of the output
results. .

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-
fessional responsibility for the reliability and
significance of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human
beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes
from time to time articles and other information
related to socially useful input and output of data
systems in a broad sense. To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical
— but productive of thought and an improved and
safer “house” for all humanity, an earth in which
our children and lster generations may have a fu-
ture, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engineer needs to
relate his engineering to the most important and
most serious problems in the world today: war,
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo-
sion, and many more.

The Understanding of Natural Language by Computers

Proposition: Computers are making long strides towards
understanding natural language as used by human
beings, and will eventually understand such language
as well as many human beings do.

What do we mean by: computers? understanding lan-

guage?‘natural language? And what is the evidence for this
proposition?

The word “computers” here refers to powerful comput-
ers that have appropriate programs written by human be-
ings plus the programmed capacity to improve their pro-
grams by using experience. An example of such improve-
ment is Dr. A. L. Samuels’ famous checker-playing pro-
gram, which can learn from experience, and which plays
far better checkers than Dr. Samuels himself can play.

The experience may consist of the following at least:

Answers from human beings to questions posed by
the computer;

Differences between computed results and @ priori
specified results;

Signals from the environment, such as instrument
readings;

Information obtained by “looks” at the environment,
as for example recognition of the character A, as
in optical character recognition;

The interpretation of words, as with FORTRAN ex-
pressions.

Probably there are even more categories of experience
which a powerful computer program can use to modify it-
self to become even a better program.

In regard to “understanding language”, there are over
500 languages which computers have been programmed to
understand, when written precisely according to stated
tules: among them, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, many
kinds of machine language, etc.

“Natural language” is the ordinary language used by hu-
man beings, subject to the requirement that for a computer

implicit understandings must be stated. For example, when
a speaker exclaims “Ouch!”’, a great deal of the meaning
comes from the listener’s observations of the speaker. But
a computer, like a blind man, cannot “see” the situation,
and must be told more than the ordinary. listener.

With some definitions taken care of, let us consider evi-
dence for the main proposition stated above. This evidence
includes the information published in several recent ar-
ticles in Computers and Automation, ~

The article ““Do What | Mean’ — The Programmer’s As-
sistant”, by Warren Teitelman, in the April 1972 issue,
described a “‘programmer’s assistant”, called “DWIM”; this
was a “front end” or preprocessor to an interactive pro-
gram for operating with LISP expressions. The front end
was tolerant of the programmer's mistakes in typing, in low-

mistake occurred, it would inquire of the human program-
mer what he meant, suggesting the correctly spelled alter-
native, and so on. In this way the human programmer was
relieved of much of the burden of expressing himself ex-
actly and correctly the first time, and his efficiency in
using the LISP interactive program greatly increased.

The three articles “Computer Programming Using Natu-
ral Language” by Edmund C. Berkeley, Andy Langer, and
Casper Otten, in the June, July, and August 1973 issues,
demonstrated the understanding by a computer program
called GENIE of at least some sets of instructions in ordi-
nary natural language. The vocabulary though small was
free; and there was unlimited freedom in putting the words
together, with about a 90% chance of complete under-
standing. The computer program that did this could be
called 15% GENIE, because, as the authors emphasized, it
was still in an early stage of development.

The article “Latest Computers See, Hear, Speak, and
Sing — and May Outthink Man” by David Brand, in the
October 1973 issue, enumerated many instances of com-
puters (and robots equipped with computers) which could
deal with concepts expressed in natural language. One of
the programs mentioned could for example decipher natu-
tal language commands dealing with the stacking of blocks
of various shapes, sizes, and colors.

The main tasks for understanding natural language ap-
pear to be the following:

Recognition of the framework of a sentence;

Recognition of the common meaning of groups of
synonyms, the collection of words that “say
the same thing”;

Knowledge of context: the context is regularly
specified to the computer, so that it does not
have to deduce the context from “what is being

Knowledge of a limited vocabulary consisting of per-
haps 300 to 500 words — knowledge in the sense
that the computer program can attach meaning to
the words either by themselves or in phrases, as
for example it may attach the meaning of doing
something three times to the numeral 3;

Capacity to accept variation in the way something is
stated by a human programmer.

The three articles referred to above show instances of
the achievement of all of these tasks separately. Combin-
ing all the achievements should not be too hard, especially
since children as young as four years old show complete
capacities to listen to many kinds of natural language, un-

derstand, and respond.

the Research Institute of America, revealed that 55%
of the firms regularly use computers in conducting
their business. Further breakdown of the study
shows that an average of 32% own or lease their own
computers, and 23% use an outside service bureau for
processing data.1!

While a majority of the companies surveyed do use
computers in some form, a significant 45%.of. the re-
spondents do not use any type of computerized data
processing service. Those companies cited the fol-
lowing reasons for not using computers :2

Service Bureau Use

In addition to the non-users, another recent
study revealed that most service bureau clients are
Not effectively using their service bureau and, as
@ result, are receiving few, if any, of the advan-
tages of electronic: data processing (EDP). Most
of the surveyed service bureau clients were:3

1. Receiving routine services which do not save
- them money.

2. Not planning to expand into more sophisticated,
- higher-payoff applications.

3. Not receiving indirect benefits and savings,
such as improved information for decision
making.

4. Not satisfied with current services.

The study also disclosed that because of the gen-
eral dissatisfaction, 30% of the surveyed service
bureau clients planned to discontinue using service
bureaus and purchase in-house computers.4

Cooperative Service Bureaus

Both non-users and dissatisfied service bureau
clients, therefore, offer a ready market for a newer
approach to obtaining the advantages of EDP — the
formation of a cooperative service bureau. A coop-
erative service bureau consists of several sponsor-
ing firms who jointly own a computer and share in
its operating costs at a much lower expense than in-
dividual ownership of a computer. If carefully
planned before operations begin, a cooperative ser-
vice bureau will provide its sponsors with all the
advantages of EDP plus many other advantages unique
to jointly-shared facilities and personnel.

Among these additional advantages are:

1. The sponsors would purchase a computer tai-
lored to their specific needs.

2. They would have’ exclusive use of the computer.

3. Their computer would be available for use at
any time.

4. They could share the costs of any computer
programs developed.

5. They could share the costs of any package or
canned computer programs purchased.

6. They would have available for their exclusive
use a staff of data processing experts and
& computer — at a fraction of the cost of
individual ownership.

Factors Insuring the Success of the Cooperative
’

The first step in forming a successful coopera-
tive service bureau is to enroll an appropriate num-
ber of comapnies. Ideally the cooperative should be
limited to five or six sponsoring firms. A larger
number may create unmanageable problems involving
operations, communications, control, scheduling of
computer time, and so forth. A smaller number may
make the venture economically unfeasible.

’
. . Lack of Interest

At the present time, widespread lack of interest
fa Joining 3 cooperative is more of a problem to po-
t jal organizers than too much demand. The author
contacted a number of public accounting firms about
the feasibility of forming cooperatives and found
that three firms who had elready made such an at-
teapt could not interest enough firms to join. Their

comments were:

= We tried to organize one several years ago;
the firms contacted were not interested.

=— We would like to explore this possibility
but we can't get anyone else interested.

— At present there appears to be a tragic lack
of interest locally by other CPA firms.
om:

a

Cnquestionably, one reason for the lack of inter-
est is a misunderstanding of the true nature of a
cooperative. Interested companies must therefore be
prepared to sell the idea to others. As more pub-
lished material becomes available in the field, this
problem should be alleviated.

Confidential Information

A second major reason for lack of interest is
that companies fear for the control and security of
their confidential or sensitive information. Such a
concern is certainly legitimate and underscores the
weed for a cooperative that is to be successful, to
devise an adequate system for quality control and
security. A committee responsible for such a system
should be established at the outset by the sponsor-
beg firms.

Protection

One of its duties should be to adequately safe-
guard the sponsors’ records and documents against
Cire, theft, water, and other hazards and disasters.
Statistics compiled by the Safe Manufacturers Na-
tienal Association show that about one-half of com-
panies whose important records and documents were
destroyed through some catastrophe never resumed
business or were permanently closed down within six
Bonths; an additional 13% suffered serious economic
tapairment and were able to remain in business only
under severe operating handicaps.5 For this reason
the quality control and security committee must see
that the cooperative service bureau maintains:

protective devices

fireproof vaults

@ method of reconstructing any destroyed
records

adequate insurance to cover loss of impor-
tant client records or documents

The committee must also take measures to prevent
one client's records from becoming commingled with
Seother client's records — a not-unlikely occurrence
§® such an environment.

Preventing Disclosure

Finally, the committee should determine how to
Prevent disclosure of confidential ipformation, For
faasple, no member of any sponsoring company should
be allowed in certain strategic parts of the com-
peter center. Likewise, each company's records

. Should be coded and the code number known only to
*} Computer center personnel. In cases requiring
simost security, the actual processing of data

Should be monitored by a key employee of the com-

Peter center or Possibly by a representative of a

disinterested third party, such as a firm of inde-
pendent public accountants.

Sharing of Expenses: Startup Costs

With an adequate number of sponsoring firms lined
up and a sound security system worked out, the third
necessity in establishing a successful cooperative
is to determine methods of sharing the expenses.
There are two categories of costs to consider:

1. Startup costs. These include all costs incur-
red prior to the time that the cooperative commences
operations. Startup costs are either directly
traceable to a particular firm or are joint or com-
mon to all firms. An example of a direct cost would
be that of analyzing, modifying, and redesigning of
systems prior to conversion to the computer. An ex-
ample of a joint or common cost would be the cost of
computer housing, including air conditioning, engi-
neering supervision, false floors, ducts and pipes,
tranformers or motor generators, cabling and wiring,
and overhead racks and supports.

Each sponsoring firm should pay for its own di-
rect costs. Joint costs should be shared equally or
apportioned among the firms according to some equi-
table formula.

° Operating Costs

2. Operating costs. These include the monthly
hardware and software costs to operate the coopera-
tive. Hardware costs refer to the periodic rental
or purchase charge for the computer equipment. As a
minimum the computer equipment consists of an input
unit, a central processing unit, and an output unit.
Software costs include personnel costs, programming
costs, testing and debugging costs, magnetic tapes,
disc packs, punched cards, paper, paper tapes’, re-
pair parts, power, telecommunication lines, and so
on.

Operating costs that are directly traceable
should be paid by the using firm. Joint or common
costs can be shared equally or can be allocated to
each firm based on the number of transactions pro-
cessed or the actual computer processing time used
during the period. In addition, if so desired, a
sponsor could be required to pay a minimum or maxi-
tum monthly charge.

Management

Fourthly, the sponsoring companies should decide
how to manage the venture. It is advisable to form
&@ committee to oversee the management and operation
of the cooperative. A decision must be made whether
each member regardless of size should have one vote
or whether another basis of voting should be used.
This decision should assure participants that no one
firm will dominate or control the cooperative.

Common Line of Business
,

A factor not to be overlooked when forming a co-
operative, one which will avoid frustrations, com-
Plications, and extra expenses, is to see that each
member is in the same industry or business category.
Thus all sponsoring firms will have similar operat-
ing problems that can be simultaneously solved by
the computer personnel, resulting in the allocation
of smaller costs to each firm for each problem
solved. Also computer programs developed or pack-
aged programs purchasec can be shared by all spon-
sors with minimum modifications, thus resulting. in
considerable programming cost savings.

“A time-sharing installation {like every computer environment) is exposed to the seven major
dangers: fire, water, theft, fraud, sabotage, equipment malfunctions, end human errors.”

Introduction

This article has as its main objective to furnish
and define some methods and provisions for control
and security in a computer time-sharing environment.

It is evident that computer time-sharing has be-
come very popular during recent years. More and
more confidential information is being handled by
these systems, creating an urgent need for strong
measures of control and security.

Description of the System

The service provided by a single computer to many
telecommunications terminals has been called "com-
puter time-sharing". With this type of service each
user shares simultaneously in the processing capa-
bilities of the central processor, This new com-
puter facility makes this service available to small
companies and/or other users who have little need
for their own computer.

Computing services that may go under the heading
of time-sharing include:

Commercial computing; text editing; databank
information retrieval services; application
services such as colleges’ records, inventory
control, payrolls of small companies, and ac-
count receivables; administrative messages;
switching and collection services; and more.

Among the great number of time-sharing users are
hospitals (Welch Hospital, one of the biggest in
Europe, has acquired the large ICL 1904S computer
with 7020 terminals), banks (Gosbank, the national
bank of the USSR, has ordered two large-scale Honey-
well series 600 with 100 terminals), schools and
colleges (British schools and colleges have started
using terminals), airlines (Continental Airlines’
uses the Sonic 360 reservation system with 550 on-
line terminals).

Trends

The growth in computer time-sharing has been phe-
nomenal in recent years in spite of a short business
recession between 1970 and 1972. Time sharing was a
broker's dream in the '60s; many companies realized
its potential, entered the market, and failed be-~
tause of: one, strong competitive pressure, and two,
because of the countless thefts and violations suf-
fered, The highly competitive situation benefited
the user in regard to pricing, but the offsetting
consequence of lower profits caused a high casualty
Tate among these companies. As a result, the number
of time-sharing firms dropped from 150 to 50 between
1969 and 1972,

A few of the companies which survived and which
account for most of today's time-sharing business
are Rapidata Corporation, Teletype Corporation (a
subsidiary of ATGT), Tymeshare Incorporated (the
largest independent firm and second only in size 10
IBM and Honeywell time-sharing operations), and IBM

Jerry Dreyer, executive president of ADAPSO, an
‘association of data processing service organizations
estimates that one time-sharing company out of three
was profitable in 1971, two out of five in 1972, and
probably three out of six in 1973. Nowadays, this
computer facility is coming back to its original
trend, and it is expected that the number of com-
puters with terminals will grow from 32% at the end
of 1971 to 45% at the end of 1975, with the average
central processing unit driving 15 to 20 terminals.

One consultant, Creative Strategies of Palo Alto,
California, predicts that time-sharing sales by 1976
will increase to 2 billion from 331 million last
year, By 1975, says ADAPSO’s Dreyer, time-sharing
will account for 1/3 of the $4.5 billion computer
services industry.

Technological Advances

Most important technological advances have been
achieved recently on on-line terminals linked to
central processors. Some of the improvements made
include solid state keyboards, which have greater
reliability and lower cost; visual display methods,
which incorporate more capacity, economy, and aes-
thetic appeal; non-impact printing techniques, which
provide faster, quieter and more reliable opera-
tions; improved lower cost memories; more powerful
logic capability; and faster and more accurate
modern techniques and improvements in central proc-
essor software,

This is only the beginning. It is foreseen that
in the future the equipment itself will change in
nature and will probably not be recognizable as
terminals per se. Rather, terminals will be modu-
lar systems consisting of the required input/output
functions for specific jobs, built around basic con-
troller and communication interfaces; in many in-
stances, terminals will become special purpose de-
vices,

Hazards °

A time-sharing installation, like every computer
environment, is exposed to the seven major dangers
of fire, water, theft, fraud, sabotage, EDP equip-
ment malfunctions, and human errors. Fire is con-
sidered to be the greatest threat to magnetic tapes.
Water does not constitute an important hazard to
magnetic tapes, but it does to computer installa-

htt care and human errors are considered the most

aampoe dangers.

sverieg systems among large corporations and ser-

« bureaus has given rise to even more potential

Need for Protection

Dve to the increasing popularity of computing
services, the issue of control and security pro-
tection has become more important. It is evident
t8at time-sharing systems present few obstacles to
eeeuthorized parties, The security problem has been
sade much more critical by the growing number of
people trained in computers and by the fading of the
tompater mystique. In addition, communication by
evans of time-sharing systems has no more protection
than telephone conversations or Morse-coded methods,
thece the technological skills necessary to inter-
pret computerized data are widespread, More and
wore companies are appointing security monitors from
tselr EDP staffs to centralize security matters,
Teede organizations such as the American Management
Association and the Bank Administration Institute,
computer firms, and research firms such as Advance-
ent Management Research, Inc. find their seminars

Sasegers and security officers from business and
gesernment,

Target of Attacks

Computers have become an important source of in-
formation and, as a result, the target of many at-
Vechs. Some of the general information targets for
\esustrial espionage are sales and service informa-
thoa, market analysis strategies, bid prices, cor-
berate finance, stockholder information, legal ne-
gotfations, planned policy changes, expansion plans,
Product developments, personnel changes, payroll
date, general administrative matters; and the list
€ovld be expanded even more,

Threats

The case of an 16 year-old Cincinnati youth who
“ted long distance telephone to tap the lines of a
‘beeesharing system firm in Louisville, Kentucky,
eed extracted data from its ledgers, as well as rec-
a of its customers, is representative of the type
ef tisk to which computer installations are exposed.

secre costly, The measures to protect data from
luce orized access vary from one system to another.
ree atns to Richard F. Cross, Security Office for
ank of New York. security svsteme should in-

clude each of the following segments: physical se-
curity; personnel security; procedural security;
audit control; insurance; and any needed interfacing.

The quality and level of protection required de-
pends on the sensitivity of the data handied. Never-
theless, control and security in a time-sharing en-
vironment should encompass the whole system, since
it is well known that even the strongest control
measures can be violated at the weakest point. These
measures should be taken in the central processing
unit, software, personnel, communication lines, the
terminal, and its users,

Mathods and Provisions —
Central Processing Unit

The central processor is threatened mostly by
sabotage, fire, water, theft, EDP equipment mal-
functions, human accidental errors and environmen-
tal problems,

The computer center of any company is the heart
of the organization, and protection of the equip-
ment against these threats can be provided by a
carefully planned computer room. Luis Scoma, Presi-
dent of Data Processing Security, Inc., recommends
that the computer center be located out of the main
traffic areas. It must be fireproof, dustfree, and
waterproof and provided with temperature and humid-
ity control and carbon dioxide fire extinguishers.
Water lines should not run through the computer
room, A separate, fireproof storage area should be
provided for data files, documentation, and oper-
ating supplies. It should also have alarm devices
sensitive to magnetism, humidity, heat, pressure,
dust, theft, power blackout, etc. There should be
strong access control including armed guards,
fenced areas, TV monitors, personnel identification
(visual, voice print, fingerprint, badge, passwords,
etc,), well-performed maintenance service, and a
number of extra provisions for protection.

Data Processing Security, Inc. has developed, for
high security necessities, an electronically oper-
ated double door entry system for access control in-
to the computer room, When a person enters the buf-
fer zone, the door locks behind him while he is sub-
jected to electronic search. If something is de-
tected, the system freezes and automatically alerts
the security guard. The second door can be opened
only with a special badge key.

A carbon dioxide (C09) fire extinguishing system,
such as the one installed at the Chase Manhattan
Bank's New York City headquarters, has proved use-
ful. Engineered by Walter Kidde & Co., Inc., this
system uses a battery of remotely located cylinders
containing the liquid gas. When activated by smoke
detectors, the gas discharges and builds up an in-
ert atmosphere in the immediately surrounding area,
extinguishing the fire without damaging equipment or
data files. Employees can go back to work within
five minutes after the fire has been put out and the
ventilation systems restarted.

Another fire-fighting system which has been de-
veloped by the Ansul Company uses Halon extinguish-
ing agents which are discharged in the form of a
colorless, odorless, and non-toxic gas. “Since Halon
agents do not work by diluting oxygen, they are
well-suited for areas. where humans are present.

The Guaranty Bank and Trust Co. of Worcester,
Mass., has adopted another approach to fire-fighting,
a system installed by Security Control Systems which
detects fire, smoke and excessive temperatures and
humiditv fluctuations and causes a moniloging and
13-00000

reporting device to alert four pre-selected phone
numbers for help.

Software

Protection of data files, whether in the form of
punch cards, magnetic tapes, or discs, is the key
element in any computer facility.

Some specific examples of software security con-
trol measures are audit trails, access regulations,
strong supervision of computer operators, the use
and control of programs utilizing program documen-
tation methods, the use of a Jog for all significant
events (such as user identification, file use and
attempts of unauthorized use), regulations to pre-
vent unauthorized personnel from browsing through
the files, and the use of a semi-automatic data. in-
ventory control system.

Personnel

Physical control as to who is allowed near the
computer and the files is advisable. Note that this
does not mean “employees only”; it implies a careful
screening of employees, repairmen, and visitors to
determine which of them should be allowed this prox-
imity to the system. Intimately involved with time-
sharing installations are three types of personnel:
operators, programmers, and maintenance engineers.

According to Dennis Van Tassel, mathematician and
head programmer at San Jose State College, all oper-
gators must understand that there exists a protection
philosophy. If personne] are expected to help en-
force and to comply with this protection philosophy,
it must be clearly defined and specified.

It is advisable to use the following provisions
for personnel control: control of logs and monitor,
division of responsibilities, rotation of duties,
adequate supervision to reduce the risk of losses
caused by accident or error, careful handling of
data files, cleanliness regulations, control access
to private files, and appropriate instruction in
case of disasters.

Terminals

Some of the most common pitfalls encountered
when using terminals are frequent communication in-
terruptions, risk of communication interception,

difficult access control, and noisy lines.

Among the greatest disadvantages of time-sharing
services are those in connection with the communi-
cation lines which link the terminals to the central
Processing unit. Telephone lines are designed for
voice communication rather than data communication,
and the results have been that such lines are too
noisy and have too many interruptions for appropri-
ate handling of data communication.

There have been some recent developments in the
improvement of data transmissions, Bell System has
developed its Digital Data Service (DDS), a data
transmission system which has been introduced early
this year in five cities (New York, Boston, Phila-
delphis, Washington, and Chicago); and, by the end
of 1974, twenty-four cities are expected to have it.
Bell further plans to provide continuous monitoring
of their DDS channels. When errors of transmission
are detected, DDS will notify the customer, Deci-
sion on retransmission will be the customer's re-
sponsibility. Another development in data communi-
cation is DUV (data under voice). By late 1973 this
technique will be in service between New York and
Chicago; consequently, communication problems should

become virtually nonexistent within the near future,
and this system will become even more popular.

Telephone lines are vulnerable to three types of
security problems: wire tapping. piggyback, and
user's sign-off signal cancellation. These common
threats may be avoided by the use of a privacy
transformation method (also called scramblers or
cryptographic techniques). This is a non-singular
(reversible) operation which conceals the original
message either by the substitution of new characters,
rearrangement of the characters, or by the adding of
strings of digits to the original message.

Some new techniques for encrypting data have
evolved, such as high speed transmission and signal
scrambling. In spite of all of these new tech-
niques, it is still possible to intercept and tap
the information. According to Tuckerman, unauthor-
ized users (intruders) who possess only limited ma-
terial and information with which to work, can read-
ily extract the original text of enciphered mes-
sages by making use of the speed, capacity, and
computational abilities of the computer..

The greater the efficiency of the privacy trans-
formation, the more difficult it becomes for unauth-
orized copying of files.

Access Control

Access to the system throughout the communication
lines should be controlled by the central processing
unit and by the user's own procedures. This is pos-
sible by cryptographic and scramble techniques, per-
sonnel regulations, user identification, appropriate
terminal location, or by ciphering and deciphering
hardware. .

Computer software packages have been written to
cipher data transmissions. Ciphering software is
an attractive technique because it can be done auto-
matically by the program which creates the data and
at a very low cost. Only programs using the match-
ing deciphering technique are able to use this data.
These special hardware cipher devices can be located
at the terminal-and at the computer to protect
transmitted data.

Scramblers or voice privacy devices are currently
being used by people who readily acknowledge the in-
security of transmitted information, Scramblers are
used by large corporations such as the oil industry
as well as by union representatives during contract
negotiation time. (Scramble phones are currently a
20 to 30 million-dollar business, excluding law en-
forcement and military purchases). Scramble devices
are now being built for time-sharing operations.
These devices offer protection similar to encryption.
Scramblers convert data into something resembling
channel noise or a malfunctioning circuit.

Other features for terminals include print in-
hibit, security keylock, operator identification
card reader, and the use of a terminal identifier.
With print inhibit the terminal operator can enter
data, such as security passwords, without its being
physically displayed. A physical keylock can be at-
tached to the terminal which will not allow the
entry of data, The operator identification card
reader reads magnetica}ly encoded information on a
magnetic strip card. The card can be used to supply
the user's password and/or name,

Direct access device security features include
file mask, volume detection, and write-exhibit
switch. The file mask controls or allows: read-only
13-00000

et read-write access to data sets, The volume de-
cecthoa switch alerts the control program when the
arlene is increased; this protects data from being
erjtten upon, This switch provides additional pro-
tect§ou for read-only volumes.

Sf date security measures fail, the use of EDP
a ance can back-up or soften the blow. Every
gasteess or person who how has an in-house computer,
ayetates or is a user of a service bureau, or trans-
ests data to a data center should be computer-secur-
aty conscious. Insurance is one of the back-up
es if prevention fails. However, not all
tes can afford or even need an elaborate and
eepeasive security system; thus, evaluation of the
seformation becomes necessary to determine those
eectsons of the system which require this protection.

tee for the additional EDP perils.

Procedure for Withdrawal

Sixth, a procedure should be established for
withdrawal from the cooperative. If the withdraw-
ing firm has not been a member for a predetermined
time, perhaps one or two years, a sliding scale
penalty fee for withdrawal should be established.

. Procedure for Admission -

Finally, procedures must be determined to govern
the admission of new members into the cooperative.
Perhaps a unanimous affirmative vote by current mem-
bers should be required to admit a new member. The
current members should also decide if a newly admit-
ted member should be required to pay a predetermined
portion of the cooperative’s startup costs and if
the cooperative should limit membership to firms of
the same approximate size as current members.

Conclusion

With due care taken in following the above steps,
establishing a successful cooperative service bureau
should be relatively easy. Companies would be well
advised to consider the idea seriously, for cooper-
ative service bureaus offer a viable and in many ways su-
perior alternative to the more costly inhouse computer
and the less satisfactory outside service bureau.

Alienation and the Systems Analyst

Alan E. Brill

Supervising Systems Analyst
The Chase Manhattan Bank N.A.
New York, N.Y. 10005

“Systems analysts ... must be seen as full-fledged members of the firm.”

A Wall of Managerial Attitudes

In most large organizations, the systems and data
‘processing departments are separated from the rest
of the firm by a wall of managerial attitudes. While
employees in most jobs are encouraged to gain a wide
variety of experience in various departments as they
Frise through various management levels, it is rare
that a systems analyst or a programmer is given an
equal opportunity. The general attitude is “He’s a
computer man, not a manager (or a businessman, or a
banker). He wouldn't fit in. Besides, he's doing a
good job where he is.”

As a result, the analyst has exactly no motiva-
tion to think of himself as an insurance man or a
businessman, or a banker, or an accountant. He is
made to feel like a consultant. He can serve the
organization, but he isn't free to move within it.
To make matters worse, some firms rotate the people
in their management development programs through a
stint in the systems department. It is little won-
der that there is a high turnover in systems ana-
lysts. The company does very little to make him
feel like a member of the family.

Potential Source of Talent

But beyond the problems brought about by the per-
sonnel turbulence, the firm is ignoring a potential
source of fine managerial] talent. Many analysts
joining major corporations hold degrees as Master,
Business Administration. Their educational back-
grounds, when combined with their ability to objec-
tively define problems and see solutions, and the
detailed working knowledge of the company gained in

‘limited to the systems department.

.

the system design process, should put them in the
management spotlight. Instead, the system analyst
finds that he has been given the indelible label of
“computer person” and that his upward mobility is
As a result,
systems analysts leave the firm, and often leave the
systems profession.

If companies hope to attract and hold talented
personnel for their systems activities. they need
to offer them an equal chance to develop to their
full potential. They must be seen as full-fledged
members of the firm — not as consultants who are
here today, but who could move on tomorrow.

Experience in Systems

As businesses come more and more to depend upon
data processing to support their operations, it
will be desirable for a significant number of man-
agement team members to have experience in systems.
Yet, by their actions, managements have forced many
talented people to avoid beginning their careers in
data processing for fear of becoming stereotyped.

So it would seem that a number of the problems
that businesses face in their systems activities are
a result of a regrettable but widesprgad management
attitude.

Only when systems analysts are regarded as having
a potential for advancement to positions in general
management, and are given an equal chance to rise in
the organization, will the systems man lose his. al-
ienation and see himself as a member of the company
team. _
Strategy and Action on World Trade

James H. Binger, Chairman
Honeywell Inc.

2701 Fourth Ave. S.
Minneapolis, Minn. 55408

“What we [the United States] have is a little corner of the world, and we must. find a
wey to live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of whom are every bit as
good as we are at almost everything we do.” :

The theme of my remarks is the intensifying con-
troversy over the conditions that influence our
well-being here in the United States — particularly
the threat of another unfortunate experience with
protectionism.

I am well aware that I cannot go deeply into this
subject in a short space. This I know because I was
privileged to serve on the President's Commission on
International Trade and Investment Policy. For over
a@ year we studied every way in which this and other
countries are affected by international trade and
investment policies.

Protectionist Attitude

‘Let there be no doubt where I stand on the prin-
cipal issue. I believe that the threat of the protec-
tionist attitude in America is far more than an is-
sue involving business and jobs. I sincerely be-
lieve that this issue embraces many powerful forces
that will have an important bearing on whether or
not all the peoples of the world make the most of
their opportunities in the years to come.

I recognize that there are strong and honest dif-
ferences of opinion on the proper direction of our
nation's foreign trade policies. There are many
persons and suppliers who have been adversely af-
fected by foreign competition. It would be unreal-
istic not to acknowledge this fact of life.

Complexity

These differences of opinion, and these disloca-
tions of people's lives, point up the complexities
of the problem. Who among us can honestly say he
understands all of the ramifications involved in the
balance of trade? Where is there an unchallenged
expert on monetary policy? What type of restraints,
if any, could or should be made on the world-wide
transfer of technology? What is the proper level
of East-West trade relations, and are the national
defense implications of yesterday still appropriate

Based on a talk before the Board of Governors of the Electronic Indus-
tries Association, Phoenix, Ariz., January, 1973.

today? Should the United States government be sup-
porting broad research and development to match the
funds that foreign countries are investing in their
industry? Can we preserve the rise in productivity
that underlies the American miracle — which is the
production of goods at low cost while wages, taxes

and dividends all rise steadily?

These are just some of the questions which must
be asked in the discussion now developing, particu-_
larly in the halls of Congress, but also at various
other governmental and community. levels.

Facing these and still other complexities, we
know that Congressional hearings soon to begin
could result in new laws and regulations which
could be detrimental.

Action

Because this is so, it will not do for anyone
with a qualified viewpoint backed by experience, to
be simply an observer. I am convinced that this
present controversy can be resolved positively, but
it will require action.

What kind of action will be most effective? the
kind of action which is in the public interest? —
not special pleadings based on the experience of a
single company, or a single industry, or even a
single community.

It is, of course, important to gather this sup-
porting information and be aware of all the facts
that bear on our needs, our experience and the op-
tions that governments can take to effect them. But
going beyond this, we must be prepared to discuss
with everyone who will exert influence on ourelected
lawmakers the more important question — what do all
these statistics and contentions mean to me?

The Concerns of U.S. Citizens

The concerns of the great body of United States
citizens are how to assure and enhance their jobs
and living conditions and be involved in what was
once unashamedly described as "the pursuit of hap-
piness”. :

¥
Let's look at just one major concern: about 1.3
million new American families are formed every year.
Approximately eight million people change their jobs
every year. About 3.7 million people join the labor
force and 2.1 million leave it. By 1980 full em-
ployment in the United States will require jobs for
100 million people, 18 million more than were em-
ployed at the end of 1972. These, quite clearly,
are the priority considerations in the minds of mil-
lions who do not clearly understand how the enter-
prise system meets their needs.

If they and the representatives of large numbers
of voters do not understand, how can we expect their
support?

I would like to review the arguments for their
support in as familiar terms:as I can muster.

The Days of U.S. Preeminence are Gone

First, let's examine one portion of the real
economic world we inhabit.

Of primary importance is the fact that the days
of almost total U.S. preeminence since the close of
World War II are gone.

We must learn to live and work in a world where
forevermore we will be dependent on other portions
of the globe for some of our more basic needs — and
some portions will be dependent on us. The U.S. is
not self-sufficient in materials, nor does it have a
corner on the world's technology, the world's inno-
vative ability, the world's marketing savvy, the
world's production know-how. What we have is a lit-
tle corner of the world, and we must find a way to
live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of
whom are every bit as good as we are at almost
everything we do.

The Energy Crisis

I hesitate, somewhat, to use the energy crisis as
an example of this dependency, because I recognize
that there are those who question whether the crisis
really exists, or who maintain that new technology
will solve the problem before it reaches crisis
stage. 1 can say at this point that there is an
energy shortage. if not a crisis; for example, the
fuel oil allotment for our Minneapolis operations
has been cut by 25 per cent for January and February,
and similar cutbacks have been imposed on other com-
panies, our schools, our common carriers.

Let's look at the dependency which is developing
in the oil industry. In the past, the repatriated
earnings of oil companies have exceeded the value of
imported oil and were a favorable factor in our in-
ternational balance of payments. By 1985, however,
our needs for oil and natural gas could create for
us a trade deficit approaching twenty billion dol-
lars a year.

As no doubt you know, we currently import I0 to
1S per cent of both crude oil and copper, 30 per
cent of our iron ore, and more than 80 per cent of
our bauxite needs. -We must import all or most of
our tin, natural rubber, nickel and chrome.

Trade with the World

We cannot go it alone. We must trade with the
world — and to trade, you give something to get
something, with the hope that both traders get what
they want and need, Unfortunately, we have not yet
been able to fully realize this goal, and much of

” the controversy over this nation's foreign-trade

policies revolves around the best way to achieve it.

There is a strong and vocal body of opinion which
believes that protectionist measures will achieve
what is best for American workers and companies in
the arena of world trade. One of their principal
targets are companies like Honeywell — multina-
tional companies with substantial investments, em-
ployees and sales outside the United States.

“Exporting Jobs’?

It is claimed that U.S. multinational corpora-
tions are "exporting jobs" overseas; that U.S. com-
panies invest overseas to take advantage of lower
wages; that imports from the overseas subsidiaries
of U.S. companies cause unemployment here at home;
that if U.S. companies were prevented from investing
and manufacturing abroad these companies would be
forced to expand their operations in the United
States, creating more jobs here; that multinational
companies invest abroad in order to avoid paying
taxes; that American corporations are exporting U.S.
technology and therefore are helping non-U.S. com-
panies compete in our own and other countries.

. The Burke-Hartke bill has been proposed as the
solution to these problems; and protectionist senti-
ment also underlies other proposals which may emerge
for the consideration of Congress.

At this point, there may be those who will accuse
me of making a tactical blunder by even mentioning
the allegations of our critics. But I'll go one
step further. If someone could prove to me that .
these allegations are factual, I'd be one of the
major supporters of moves to inhibit the growth of
multinational companies.

The Opposite is True: Making Jobs

Thanks to various companies, government agencies
and trade associations who have accumulated the
facts and published them, I know otherwise.

I am convinced, thanks to these studies, and my
experience with Honeywell, that multinational com-
panies-do not export jobs, but create jobs in the
United States faster than other U.S. companies. I
am convinced that U.S. companies invest abroad to
gain participation in markets in other countries,
not to take advantage of lower wages or so-called
tax loopholes. I am convinced by these studies that
imports from the overseas subsidiaries of U.S. com-
panies have not been a major factor in U.S. unem-
ployment.

To be more specific, I'd like to give you some
information taken from a survey conducted by the
Emergency Committee on American Trade, of which I
am amember. This committee researched the domestic
and international operations of 74 U.S. corporations
representing a broad group of large multinational
corporations. This survey reveals that in the
years between 1960 and 1970, when these companies
were increasing their overseas operations, they also
provided 900,000 new jobs in the United States. They
also increased their sales from Amerigan facilities
— work performed in this country — from $58 bil-
lion to $113 billion — nearly doubled, in fact.
Their, exports from the United States nearly tripled
in this period, rising from $4.3 billion to $12.2
billion. In the all-important balance of payments
category, they increased their net surplus of ex-
ports over imports from $3.2 billion to $6.6 billion
— more than doubled.

international Investment Activities
of Multinational Companies

These figures, and other results of the survey,
lead to one major conclusion: That the interna-
tional investment activities of these representative
multinational companies played an important role in
their rapid export growth and consequently made a
major positive contribution to their domestic — and
I emphasize the word domestic — sales, investment

“and employment growth.

Double Taxation

I have tried to speak in familiar language; so I
have some misgivings about discussing the issue of
taxes. But the tax issue is an important one, and
I'd like to cover some specific areas which are com-
ing more and more into public ‘discussion.

-_

issue is the section of U.S.:tax law which al-
lows American corporations a tax credit for the in-
come taxes they pay to foreign countries on income
earned in such countries. The purpose of this tax
credit is to avoid taxing the foreign earnings of
U.S. corporations twice — once in a foreign country
and again when the earnings are remitted to the
United States.

Opponents of this tax credit argue that since do-
mestic firms are not allowed a federal tax credit
for the state taxes they pay, the current method of
taxing income from foreign sources is inconsistent
with the way domestic income is taxed.

Taxation by U.S, States

A major fallacy in this argument is that it is
based on the incorrect assumption that the taxation
of domestic income by city, state and the federal
government is analogous to the United States taxing
the foreign earnings of American subsidiaries which
have already been taxed by the host country.

The proper analogy is between the way states
treat corporate income earned in two or more states
and the way the U.S. government treats income earned
in two or more countries. Every state which has a
state income tax provides a method of allocating the
income of a multi-state company among the various
states in order to avoid duplicate taxation of the
same income. As a matter of fact, the constitution
requires this. Thus the current methods of taxing
foreign and domestic income are consistent.

Further, where one domestic corporation in the
United States has an ownership position in another
domestic corporation, the federal income tax law
quite properly prevents duplication of corporate in-
come taxes. The parent company is taxed on earnings
of the owned company only when such earnings are
distributed as a dividend — and then at no more
than a nominal rate. What logic can there be in the
Burke-Hartke proposal that earnings of an overseas
subsidiary — in most cases earnings already taxed
in the foreign country at rates comparable to or
higher than U.S. rates — should be immediately re-
taxed at full U.S. income tax rates?

tnternational Competition by
American Industry

Another fundamental element of the issue is the
tax credit's relationship to the ability of American
industry to compete internationally. According to a
recent survey by the National Association of Manufac-
turers, if the United States were to repeal the tax

credit for foreign taxes paid and tax all foreign
subsidiary income before it is paid out in dividends
to the parent company, U.S. firms with foreign oper-
ations would be forced to pay an average effective
tax on their foreign earnings of over 70 per cent.

Given this added tax handicap, few American firms
could continue to compete with foreign-controlled
companies for world markets.

You can appreciate how useful it is to have these
facts for presentation where ‘contradictory allega-
tions are being made. Let's keep the record straight!

Also useful to the undertaking on which we must
all embark is the factual story of what imports and
exports do, beneficially to create jobs.

Imports Produce One Million U.S. Jobs

Labor Department figures document the finding
that one million jobs in the United States are de-
pendent on imports — ‘jobs for food processors, ship
and dock workers, truck drivers and railroaders,
warehouse employees and retail clerks. And it's
equally impressive to corsider that every billion
dollars worth of exports creates 60-to-80,000 jobs
in the United States. .

As we assess the situation, let us not forget the
dilemma our government faced in August 1971. As
Mr. Peter Peterson wrote, the New Economic Policy
announced that month was not, and I quote, "a one-
shot reaction to a one-time crisis. It marked the
beginning of a new era of more flexible, enduring,
and viable economic relationships among nations. The
years behind us were by and large an era of success,
but an era based upon a system which had become out-
grown, outworn — and increasingly crisis-prone.”

Tariffs and Free Trade

Mr. Peterson was referring to the tremendous in-
pact that international trade and monetary factors
were having on our people. We have since come to
learn the difficulty of achieving universally ap-
proved corrective action. And now we must reckon
with this reality: U.S. negotiators are preparing
to enter economic talks next fall that could shape
future international relationships for many years to
come. Our government can and should strive in these
talks to put an end to present attitudes and trends
that point ominously to another “balkanization" of
world trade.

It can and should seek agreement to reduce, and
if possible end, all tariffs on industrial trade by
the end of this century.

It can and should try to create far freer trade
conditions for farm products.

It can and should seek the harmonization among
nations of the present hodgepodge of non-tariff
trade barriers and preferences.

But these objectives will remain forlorn hopes
unless our negotiators can go into these hard bar-
gaining sessions with the clear backing of the Amer-
ifan people and their Congress. We muss give them
that.

Computer Art: The Search Beyond Manipulation

Grace C. Hertlein
California State University—Chico
Chico, Calif. 95926

“Computer arts are still in the highly experimental stage of emergence.”

In present computer art, the naive onlooker could
readily misconstrue that mathematical processing of
data and manipulation of design represent the total
modus operandi of this new form, rather than just
the initial phases of exploration. A review of the
varied computer arts reveals diverse input of pat-
terns and subsequent manipulation or transformation,
creating a series of new, perceptual audio or visual
images. There appears a similarity of approaches
and some variation of the techniques utilized by
practitioners of the cybernetic arts: graphics
sculpture, film, dance, music, textile design, weav-
ing, poetry, and architecture.

There is a tendency to forget that the computer
arts are still in the highly experimental stages of
emergence, and although some attractive and very
pleasing works have been accomplished, this new me-
dium has generally not progressed much beyond its
mathematical and scientific origins. At times, in
viewing or hearing the output of the computer arts,
one would relegate the resultant art form to the
category of interesting sound or visual patterns,
experimental/initial exercises, or mathematical and
scientific visualization, rather than as works of
art per se. (This latter statement is equally true
of contemporary manual experimental art.) There is,
at the present time, a tendency for the computer
arts to relate to an elite coterie, made up of
scientists and intellectuals, rather than the public
at large. However, as this new art medium is given
greater space in the. mass media, this audience
should enlarge greatly. as exposure acquaints the
general audience with the potential of this new art
orm.

Pattern Manipulation

Manipulation of design by the computer may be de-
liberate, (or at times highly experimental) as
change or transformation of the original pattern is
achieved via a host of techniques developed within
the past twelve years. However, in attempting to
see precedent in manipulation of design, one ob-
serves ample evidence of a growing interest by ar-
tists and critics in combining (manually) mathemat-
ics and art. Since the turn of the century, such
techniques and philosophy have been practiced and
even more verbally expressed by electronic and con-
crete musicians. Further, the concept of pattern
manipulation is as old as man's art, and one finds
ample evidence of this concept throughout art his-
tory. A few such examples are: Offset X/Y patterns
in Persian sculptural reliefs; repetitions of design
in serial imagery from early Greek vases; reversals
of pattern in the compositions of Bach; mirror im-
ages and mathematical progressions of design in the
Foundation Course exercises of the Bauhaus School;
juxtaposition and superposition of musical patterns
throughout musical history; and randomization of
musical variations via throwing of dice, as prac-
ticed by Mozart. The world was quite ready philo-
sophically and mathematically for further explora-
tions in such transformation of pattern, yet it was
not until the speed of the computer afforded this
electronic manipulation, that it became feasible to
such a degree. (Alteration, change, and transforma-
tion of pattern is revealed in other technological
Systems that may or may not use the computer as an aid in
Creation: synthesized video, sound, andthe film.) In
other words, science and technology now afford fur-
ther exploration of ideas and techniques that have
been practiced by experimental artists for years.

The philosophy and practice of twentieth century
music shows a very great Similarity between the ma-
nipulative techniques used by musicians since the
early 1900's and the present-day computer procedures.
Examination of the philosophy of the Bauhaus and
study of the works emanating from this revolutionary
school, also reveals great similarities in the ap-
proaches to creation, and in the final works of art
of this school and present-day computer arts.

The ‘computer artist is manipulating patterns, be-
cause this is an inherent potential of the computer
medium. The manual artist (or scholar), by con-
trast, is bound to laborious manual processing of

data and pattern, and thus generally discovers to a
lesser degree, further sources of innovative and

perceptual changes, i.e., manipulation as practiced

in the computer arts is not teasible manually. When
perceptual change is accomplished manually (many of

the works in Graphis afford excellent examples),
such change is not only excessively time-consuming,
but represents a manual tour de force. It could be
more readily accomplished via the computer.

The manual artist is generally not concerned with
perceptual change or alteration of the original im-
age. On the other hand, since the computer readily
affords such changes, the cybernetic artist may
literally exploit component designs, taking them
th#eG@h what may appear to be unlimited design
changes. The more abstract the component design,
the more readily it lends itself to mathematical
variation and processing, termed design state
variation.

Design State Variation

This is a term devised by the writer, adapted
from given "state" variations used in printmaking,
in which one may revise a plate or stone, and al-
ter it by additions and/or changes of pattern, re-
sulting in a series of new works. The term denotes
known variations of pattern that are possible. which
may be used as sub-routines or stored on the com-
puter library and merely called by the user, who de-
fines the values of the given parameters of the spe-
cific algorithms being utilized. One of the most
provocative concepts emerging in computer art is
that of being to literally predict innumerable de-
sign state variations, in which a basal component
will be visually or auditorially pleasing. The art-
ist may use only those design states that reflect
personal expression of design. (One might compare
design state variations to the many kinds of chisels
the sculptor may use in execution of a work of art,
each giving unique effects.) Further, this library
of manipulative design state variations is constantly
being enlarged by experimenters in the computer
arts. A brief listing follows:

Offsets of pattern on the X, Y, X/Y¥ (pro-
gressions in music)
Mirror images or reversals on the X, Y, X/Y
Scalar variations or duration of pattern in
superposition of form
Rotation, in open or closed forms
Irregular radiation of images and forms with
growing scalar values
Redundant serial imagery in closed form
Polygon serial imagery, with circular, square,
or varied final form
Positive and negative variations of repeated
or design-related patterns
Disintegrating variants of images and sounds
_ in redundant or transform pattern
Metamorphic variations of images or sounds
in predetermined sequences .
Transformations of pattern, in which one de-
sign becomes another :
Alterations of design by mathematical algor-
ithms
Pseudo-randomizations of patterns with artist-
imposed parameters
Overlays of images and sounds in dimensiona)
forms
Combinations of related patterns, using any of
__ the above design states
Multi-media combinations, using any of the
eforementioned

Prior to design state variation, the artistic
idea is stated in coherent, sequential steps. It may
be flow-charted before translation into a computer
program. Thus the art idea is transformed into ana-
lyzed data, using synthetic machine languages, and
is then subject to processing and manipulation via
the computer using design state variations, reveal-
ing innumerable new, final works. Examples include:

The warp and weft patterns in weaving

Classical ballet positions, with designations
of the head, arms, and feet

Structural modules in sculpture and archi-
tecture

Derivations of design from art or musical
history, including the archaic, the classi-
cal, or the contemporary

Formulae and transformations from science or
mathematics ~

Stylistic analysis of a given artist's style,
with designation and statement of a speci-
fic set of definitions describing the style

Artistic composition of a given musical era,
with. parameters of such rules

Thus the art idea is initially expressed in the
manner of science, but it does not end there. The
choice of the art idea or problem should express the
personal philosophy of the originator, whether it is
mathematical formulae, natural derivations from the
environment, or analyses of prior styles of artists.
The personal focus of the original idea, ensuing
variation and execution cannot be too strongly
stressed! The design state variations allow the
artist to choose the given direction of psychic ex-
pression. Further, selection of specific computer
systems and art materials affords a highly individ-
ual element within cybernetic creation. And Fastly,
the varying techniques of execution, which may be
preplanned or participant, add a unique and personal
opportunity to spontaneously participate within the
formation of the work of art, or to maximize the ca-
pacities of the computer in artistic execution, us-
ing preplanned or heuristic modes.

Diverse Philosophies of Computer Art

Stylistic analysis and resultant design deriva-
tion are highly visible in the computer arts and
possess decided benefits: these techniques allow one
to analyze more thoroughly the subject under study,
and in addition, they allow the artist to gain per-
ceptual variations and permutations of the original
source not obtainable by manual methods. (The writer
and many others have often found these newdepartures
from the design source to be as or more aesthetic
than the original input source.) There is, however,
a@ great tendency among humanists to concern them-
selves with past styles and subject matter, as being
more "pure" aesthetically than the present. On the
other hand, there is an equal tendency among scien-
tists to exploit mathematical manipulation, disre-
gard art totally, and to have the computer and its
peripheral devices accomplish the work of art, with-
out intervention by man. Here one finds two ex-
tremes, with beginning dogmatic statements by art-
ists of varying capacities and philosophies. The in-
sightful computer artist, however, seeks to unite
personal philosophy and expression with the highest
level of computer usage.in a statement of artistic
unity. However, one is conscious of new visions
emerging throughout history, which are subsequently
categorized and “cast in bronze,” as “the way." Com-
puter art appears to be no exception to this great

“In science fiction writing, non-specialists attempt to involve other non-specialists in
the human questions arising from computer use.”

In “The Computer and the Poet.” Norman Cousins
emphasizes that the role of poets, “those who have
respect for and speak to the human spirit," becomes
even more important as computer usage increases (32).
Science fiction writers should indeed be included as
poets in our technological age. All too often in
our society, problems arising from technology are
left to technologists because others are too unsure
of their own knowledge to question or criticize. The
science fiction writings directly involving comput-
ers are one of the few places where non-specialists
attempt to involve other non-specialists in the
human questions arising from computer use.

Emphasis on Man

Perhaps the most recurrent science fiction theme
is the difference between computers and man. These
Taise the question of the proper role for machines
versus the proper role for humans or emphasize the
aspects that make man unique. In one story (Asimov,
"Someday") children in a society where reading and
writing are no longer needed form a secret society
to learn just for the joy of it; in another (Weir,
"What Happened to the Teaching Machine") where all
learning is by machine, only uneducated children
still know how to pose questions. A super-computer
is defeated by a human because he can bluff or “lose
to win” and it cannot (Caiden, The God Machine);
another super-computer is robbed of its control be-
cause of a group of humans whose main desire is
freedom (Pohl, Starchild); and to others (Dick, "The
Variable Man"; Sheckley, "Fool's Mate") human unpre-
dictability continues to be a problem. This distinc-
tive aspect of man is very directly stated by the
computer builder in a» French science fiction story
{Boulie, “The Perfect Robot"). In trying to make
the computer more like man, he progressively adds to
its ability to deal with data, the ability to play
chess, language, concepts of love, the ability to
engender new machines, concepts of good and evil,
and finally what he considers to be the crucial
missing element — "I have unhinged them". Mike, a
super-computer capable of running an entire revolu-
tion (Heinlein, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress), can-
Rot understand why a joke is funny, and the computer

AM (Ellison, “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream")
hates people because unlike them "he could not wan-
der, he could not wonder, he could not belong, he
could merely be".

Science fiction writers persist in confronting
their readers with a question that receives little
direct discussion but is of current concern. As ex-
pressed by the historian Bruce Mazelish (33), just
as continuities were established with the material
universe, the animal kingdom, and our, subconscious,
we are faced with transcending the 4th discontinuity
— of harmonizing our existence and those of mach-
ines in a technological society. Or, as expressed
by Weizenbaum ("On the Impact of the Computer on So-
ciety”) the insights of science such as those pro-
vided earlier by the work of Galileo, Darwin, and
Freud, and now provoked by the advent of the com-
puter, shake man's self-esteem because, when viewed
superficially, they seem to diminish man.

Mechanistic View of Man

We diminish man and in our anxiety grow more dis-
dainful of ourselves and ambivalent towards comput-
ers if computer usage is predicated on a mechanistic
view of man and this mechanistic view becomes our
self-image. Too many statements made by systems
analysts or computer scientists display that a com-
puter-usable view of man is being substituted for
the whole man. Keep in mind the above list of human
attributes contrasted to computers by science-fic-
tion writers as you read the following statement
from the widely read and much discussed book Limits

of Growth written by well-motivated systems analysts:

Some considered the model too ‘technocratic’
observing that it did not include eritical so-
cial factors, such as the effects of adoption
of different value systems. The chairman of
the Moscow meeting summed up this point when
he said, ‘Man is no mere biocybernetic device’.
This criticism is readily admitted. The pres-
ent model considers man only in his material
system because valid social elements simply
13-00000

could not be devised and introduced in this

* first effort. Yet, despite the model's mater-
ial orientation, the conclusions of the study
point to the need for fundamental changes in
the values of society. (34, p. 191)

Admission that the world model has a minor flaw of
omitting "critical social factors” followed so
blithely by conclusions about fundamental value
changes surely conveys to the reader that the fac~-
tors that have been dealt with are the more essen-
tial and more significant.

Again recall the human attributes as you read:

By the same token since the thinking human
being is also an information processor, it
should be possible to study his processes and
their organization independently of the details
of the biological mechanisms — the ‘hardware’

ygeom- that implement them. (Simon and Newell,
““nformation-Processing in Computers and Man",
p. 256)

That the theories

» « . are mechanistic — that they postulate
only the processes capable of being effected
by mechanism — is guaranteed by simulating
the behavior predicated by ordinary digital
computers. (ibid. p. 258)

To reemphasize the contribution of science fic-
tion, let us trace through one well-written and pop-
ular book, Stand on Zanzibar (Brunner). In the 2]st
century over-populated world, there is a very ad-
vanced computer Shalmaneser owned by General Tech-
nic, a company large enough to be contemplating the
subsidization, modernization, and management of a
small underdeveloped country Beninia. Beninia is
unique since it alone has retained peacefulness and
trust and humane behavior. Computer analysis is un-
dertaken of the feasibility of the 6.T. project and
for alternative plans of carrying it out. With re-
gard to the possibility of computer analysis of what
makes Beninia attractive, one sensitive character in
the book says"... when they get love down to a
bunch of factors you can analyze with a computer,
there'll be nothing left of whatever makes it worth
being human". Shalmaneser eventually rejects the
data on Beninia because it is inconsistant with re-
ality. Mulligan, a cynical sociologist, gets the
computer to process the data by adding the additional
assumption that an unknown force is active in that
population. Mulligan points out that the scientists
who have been working toward consciousness for the
super-computer have been successful because the re-
jection of the data was a display of its first human
characteristic — "orneriness" or "bloody-minded-
ness”. When faced with something different, it chose
to reject it instead of broadening its view of the
possible. Mulligan sets out to find what makes
Beninia different and traces it to a genetic muta-
tion which produces a body odour that surpresses in
others the territorial-aggression reaction. Mulli-
gan's hope is that a world-renowned biologist who is
working on modification of human genetic maps can
use this to better mankind. His hope is shattered
when he learns that this biologist has been murdered
for political reasons. The decision is that the ma-
chine will work on finding an external synthetic
spray. Mulligan is led away crying for lost human-
ity " ... what in God's name is it worth to be hu-
man, if we have to be saved from ourselves by a ma-
Chine?" The now conscious machine has the last word
and the last sentence of the book “Christ, what an
imagination I've got". The irony of the book is
that Mulligan, who represents and speaks for those

characteristics which are human, falls into another

‘ part of the prevalent mechanistic trap — aggression

is in our genes; the solution to our problems will
be via a specific scientific breakthrough.

Superstates and Sypersystems

A concern for the use of computers in politics
and government is seen in numerous stories. Opin-
dion polling in a political campaign is involved in
The 480 (Burdick), and the writing of campaign lit-
erature in The Novel Computer (Escarpit). The pre-
diction of elections is carried to an extreme in
“Franchise” (Asimov) where only one vote is needed
to determine the election, and Counterfeit World
(Galouye) describes an entire synthetic‘society (an
“electromathematical model") made up for purposes of
opinion surveying. Of greater concern, however, are
the super-states dependent on or replaced by super-
computer systems. Many of these stories describe
the process by which men gradually gave away self-
determination in exchange for material well-being,
or in the belief that a larger something was needed
to protect them from each other (Anderson, "Sam
Hall"; Cole, The Funco File; Dick. Yulcan's Hammer;
Fairman, I, the Machine; Mason, Matrix; Pohl, Star-
child). Often, no one really understands any longer
how the system works (Cameron, Cybernia; Cole, The
Funco File; Delany, The Fall of the Towers; Dick,
Vulcan's Hammer; Fairman, I, the Machine; Mason,
Matrix). In most cases, the vast destructive power
of the system is realized when, for some reason, it
is no longer serving human énds. One computer over-
emphasizes the goal of protecting itself (Dick, Vul-
can's Hammer), one gets carried away by its goal of
avoiding thermo-nuclear war (Cardin, The God Ma-
chine), two become lonely and hence mad (Fairman, 1,
the Machine; Pohl, Starchild), another becomes psy-
chotic because of what it learns from men's minds
(Delany, The Fall of the Towers), others are under
the control of selfish people (Cameron, Cybernia;
Sladek, The Reproductive System). Most of these
systems are destroyed by man's more flexible intel-
ligence. However, in one story (Miller, "Dumb
Waiter"), the system goes on even after there are no
more people, and in another (Dick, “Autofac"), with-
out the knowledge of the people.

Loss of Control

Some ten years ago when discussing views of com-
puters in science fiction, I pointed out that few
contemporary stories could be viewed simply as man's
worries about his machines getting beyond his con-
trol. I noted that most of the stories focused on
extensions of specific current uses and emphasized
man's responsibilities as technology advanced (30,
31). While there are some stories in which comput-
ers turn on their makers (Dnieprov, “Siema"), the
Stories just cited have two significantly different
characteristics. The stories do not begin with the
construction of a machine motivated by curiosity or
scientific naivetée, but instead, they begin with
the populace agreeing to control by the machine. We
read, for example, that in 1993 after a large world
war, all nations agree to "subordinate themselves in
a realistic manner ... to a common supranational
authority ..." which is a machine so that it won't
put "interest over reason, emotion over logic"
(Dick, Vulcan's Hammer p. 19); or that another mach-
ine is built to control the world because with stone
axes men could be free as they could do only limited
damage before they were stopped but with advanced
technology men could do damage so much more quickly
they cannot be free to start (Pohl, Starchild). In

A Tale of the Big Computer (Johannesson), a history
of life until the "computer age,” we learn that man
13-00000

is a part of the evolution leading up to computers
‘and that the basic cause of his failure was the in-
ability to organize a complex society. In the very
enjoyable Funco File (Cole), when the question is
raised, "Has it become your ruler, your god ..."?,
the response is, "Well, no. Not exactly. It's more
like where our technology triumphs have finally got
us to. I guess you might say our real ruler was al-
ways an idea of what's normal or not. Conformity, I
guess you'd call it ... I suppose the Machine —
plus the F.0.1. — working together — have sort of
externalized it once and for all." In the stories
where there is a struggle between man and the com-
puter, it is not a struggle to retain contro! but to
get it back once it has knowingly been given away or
unwillingly allowed to slip away.

Consequences of Bigness

The persistent theme in these stories is that of
’ SS — big states and big computer systems —
and its consequences. This bigness iswell described
in an article by Weizenbaum. This article is impor-
tant because it is one of the few expository state-
ments of this serious theme.

These often gigantic systems are put to-
gether by teams of programmers, often working
over a time span of many years. By the time
the systems come into use, most of the origi-
nal programmers have left or turned their at-
tention to other pursuits. It is precisely
when gigantic systems begin to be used that
their inner workings can no longer be under-
stood by any single person or by a small team
of individuals. ... This situation, which is
now upon us, has two consequences: first that
decisions are made on the basis of rules and
criteria no one knows explicitly. and second
that the system of rules and criteria becomes
immune to change. ("On the Impact of the Com-
puter on Society,” pp. 612-613).

What is the effect of this situation on individuals
and on society? Two side effects are discussed by
Weizenbaum.

First of course, there is the psychological
impact on individuals living in a society in
which anonymous, hence irresponsible, forces
formulate the large questions of the day and
circumscribe the range of possible answers.
+--+ But even worse. since computer-based know-
ledge systems become essentially unmodifiable
except in that they can grow, and since they
induce dependence and cannot, after a certain
threshold is crossed, be abandoned, there is
an enormous risk that they will be passed from
One generation to another, always growing.
CIbid., p. 613)

Computers Are Not Gadgets

The reader may argue the degree to which these
side effects are already present in our society, but,
if he reads sicence-fiction, he cannot ignore them.
While the first theme of the differences of man and
machines may be the most repeated, this second theme
is probably the most important. The science-fiction
writers maintain their importance as poets of the
“computer revolution” by redirecting our attention
from the computer as “gadget” to the computer as an
integral part of the modern configuration of govern-
ment ~academe-industry-management which shares skills,
resources, techniques, personnel, and goals. Just as
our image of the scientist has changed from the man
standing lonely vigil over a bubbling retort to

prove his scorned hypothesis, the isolated computer
with a programmed quirk, asked the wrong question or
fed the wrong data, is no longer hero. Franken-

stein's monster, or the more recent, Karl, Emmy, and

Siema, for example, are very limited creations with

identifiable creators, circumscribed environments,

and restricted effects. We now have instead Shal-
maneser, Project 79, Vulcan 3, Allied Mastercomputer,
or simply, The Machine. The new computer-hero has
remote access, varied input and output devices, pro-
cesses large amounts of data supplied by different
agencies, works in real-time, makes policy decisions
based on quasi-mathematics, commands vast resources,
and affects large numbers of people.

our world trade. These weights must be removed and
this need must be attended to by Congress and our-
selves. We must endorse, broaden and actively sup-
port the steps that adjustment assistance can take
to alleviate human distress, cushion the impact of
change and spur internal transition to successful
competitive enterprise.

When we become more familiar with the great in-
fluence wielded by exports and the creative capabil-
ities of companies that operate in many lands, we
will do a lot more to overcome, where they exist,
the. penalties we pay for the benefits we enjoy. I
firmly believe this.

If I have reminded you of both the pluses and
minuses that world trade produces, ask yourself how
much of this your family knows and understands. See
how skillful you can be in finding ways to make this
vital topic really interesting to your family, your
neighbors, your associates and the other thinkers,
teachers and decision-makers in your community.

This we will do, wherever we have Honeywell
people who have built their careers on unraveling
knotty problems in research, production, distribu-
tion, legislation and public affairs.

We mean to do the things which will make the or-
dering of a sound world trade policy in the Cnited
States the logical and popular response to a broad
and informed public petition.

We intend to urge businessmen, labor leaders, and
government officials to work for a system of world
business that will create jobs all over the world —
not in one country to the disadvantage of another.

‘A fabulous gift for Christmas:

“RIDE THE EAST WIND: Parables of Yesterday and Today”

by Edmund C. Berkeley, Author and Anthologist

Over fifty parabies (including anecdotes, allegories, and fables) by Berkeley and many other
authors, modern and ancient, dealing with famous problems, modern, classic, or ageless. Many

“=: parables are decorated by a bouquet of proverbs and quotations — for readers who like to
choose which variety of lesson appeals to them. A short guide to some patches of common
sense and wisdom. An ideal gift. Illustrated. Hard cover. 224 pages.

Do you remember the story of the fox
and the grapes? illustrating a principle of
such timeless value that the phrase “sour
grapes” has been used and understood by
millions of people for 2000 years?

Well, why not make a collection of
ideas and principles of common sense and
wisdom — and why not illustrate them
with fables, allegories, and anecdotes of
enormous impact?

That was the plan of this book.

§t comes right out of our work on the
“Notebook on Common Sense and Wisdom,
Elementary and Advanced” — which we
have been talking about for two years to

. @nyone who wouid listen. ”

Some of the issues of the Notebook
roused the interest of the president of
Qusadrengle Books — and this book is one
of the results.

You can’t lose by taking a look at

this book:
@ You might enjoy it.
@ You might find much of it
humorous and imaginative —
as did Aesop’s listeners.
@ You might find it instructive,
phildsophical, worth thinking
about, and more besides.
You can see it, read it, keep it for
7 days, return it, and back comes the
full price of the book. *

How can you lose?

The Fox of Mt. Etna and the Grapes
Once there was a Fox who lived on the lower slopes of
Mt, Etna, the great volcano in Sicily. These slopes are ex-
tremely fertile; the grapes that grow there may weil be the
_ Most delicious in the world; and of ali the farmers there,
Farmer Mario was probably the best. And this Fox longed
and longed for some of Farmer Mario's grapes. But they
grew very high on arbors, and all the arbors were inside a
vineyard with high walls, and the Fox had a problem. Of
course, the Fox of Mt Etna had utterly no use for his fam-
ous ancestor, who leaping for grapes that he could not reach,
cailed them sour, and went away.

The Fox decided that what he needed was Engineering
Technology. So he went to a retired Engineer who lived on
the slopes of Mt. Etna, because he liked: the balmy climate
and the view of the Mediterranean Sea and the excitement of
watching his instruments that measured the degree of sieep-
ing or waking of Mt. Etna. The Fox put his problem be-
fore the Engineer.

' EDITORIAL

(an updated version of an editorial first printed May 1973)

Burying Facts and Rewriting History - Il

One of the efforts of this magazine is to pursue truth.

One of the ways in which truth is pursued is not to let
statements of the utmost importance be buried and for-
‘Pltten in the pages of daily newspapers, nor unreported
and lost because they are no longer well covered in nation-
al news magazines.

Among those statements are two of permanent interest
in connection with the Watergate Caper (this phrase is es-
tablishmentese for “the Watergate Crime”).

— The statement by Bernard L. Barker, one of the con-
victed operatives, which explains his motivation
and background (see November 1972, Computers
and Automation).

~~ The statement by Alfred Baldwin, 3rd, ex-FBI agent,
an employee of the Republican Committee to Re-
elect the President, telling what he did and saw
while five men burglarized the Watergate offices
of the Democratic National Committee on June
17, 1972, about 2:30 a.m. (see December 1972,
C&A).

In addition, we have published seven installments of re-
ports on the Watergate Crime by our contributing editor,
Richard E. Sprague (a computer professional of 25 years
standing) who as an avocation has studied for many years
dirty political operations in the United States, including
the assassinations by conspiracies (not “lone assassins”) of
President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and
Reverend Martin Luther King.

Three years ago in May 1970, when we began to pub-
lish this type of article, we could not have spoken confi-
dently of “‘the assassination by conspiracies” of two
Kennedys and one King. But the articles we have pub-
lished — which are listed and characterized on the follow-
ing pages — have together a remarkable impact.

Taken together, the information published May 1970 to
October 1973 in Computers and Automation effectively
destroys a large segment of the beliefs, the rewritten his-
tory, that the establishment in the United States has
arranged for people in the United States to believe. 1 do
not assert that the establishment is a conscious organism
Or Organization; perhaps the best description is this: a
loose confederation of overt conspiracies, silent conspir-
acies, and biased wealthy persons, with very intelligent
orchestration stemming from the Pentagon, the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Presidency, and with assists
from organized crime and the Mafia.

We challenge any fairminded person to read this col-

may be ordered from us), and after reading them, to still
believe that the assassinations are actually the actions of
“lone psychopaths,” instead of fitting together into a plan
to install a certain kind of autocracy in the United States.

This kind of autocracy claims to be democratic, to
stand up for “national security,” “executive privilege,”
“separation of Constitutional powers,” etc. It offers ap-
pearances of democracy, but it seizes the realities of
money and power. It cuts programs of social benefit; but
it allocates $80 billion a year to be paid to the military-
industrial-Pentagon complex.

In the 1940’s there was a name for this kind of autoc-
racy. Its name was “fascism,” effectively a dictatorship
in the interests of big business. What is now appearing in
the U.S. is “fascism” in the form of a dictatorship by the
military-industrial complex.

Here in a nutshell is an example of the present uneven
contest: it takes the form of two sentences in 4 report by
E. Drake Lundell, Jr., in Computerworld for April 22,
1973: :

@ The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department
is “outmanned and outgunned” when it comes to
prosecuting cases like the current action against IBM,
Senate investigators were told last week,

@ In addition, witnesses before the Senate Antitrust
and Monopoly Subcommittee stated that often the
division cannot do its job properly because of polit-
ical pressure from the White House. ...

These two statements contain a world of implications.

Essentially, the Department of the United States Gov-
ernment which is charged with enforcing certain U.S. laws
against monopoly, can no longer properly function because
of (1) the enormous power of just one business, IBM, and
(2) political pressure from the White House (this phrase is
establishmentese for “President Richard M. Nixon”),

7
We must dig up facts, remember them, and write
history the way it is.
We must take action to compel the persons who deceive
us and lie to us to leave the government of the United
States, such as Spiro Agnew, former Vice President.

Situation Room could have resulted from infor-
mation available in Dallas and Washington prior to
the announcement — and thus does not actually
demonstrate that someone there had a guilty fore-
knowledge of the shooting.

21>) The Framing of Lee Harvey Oswald
by Richard E. Sprague, Hartsdale, N.Y.

When Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested, Nov. 22,
1963, for the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, he said to his captors in the Dallas jail
cell, “I'm a patsy”. A review of the evidence
(including 18 photographs) proves that Oswald
was a patsy, and that he was “framed” for the
murder of President Kennedy — although “‘estab-
lishmentese” American history denies it.

Hertlein — Continued from page 19

human failing. Even the most broad-minded practi-
tioner is bound by his or her capacities and philos-
ophy, and it requires a deliberate and concerted ef-
fort to remain open-minded, and to appreciate varied
approaches that are not in accord with one's own
temporary aesthetic parameters. One discerns com-
puter artists who prefer natural or man-made pat-
terns and sounds, vs. those who desire only mathe-
matics, electronic and computer sounds, sans the
human touch. There are those who exploit two or
three-dimensional static images, vs. the creators
who prefer moving permutations in flux, declaiming
that the computer is a perceptual medium, and there-
fore should not be imprisoned in static form, i.e.,
cybernetic art is “pure idea,” ad infinitum. Ironi-
cally, even the newest of the arts appears destined
to hardening within specific schools of thought,
with separatist camps warring in "vs." expression
and debate.

Summary

It is obvious that the concept of manipulation
and processing via the computer is merely the first
stage of cybernetic creation. Even now, far beyond
the statements of the artistic problem and aesthetic,
personal variation, is a vast, open territory that
is being explored by questioning, hardy intellec-
tual pioneers, as they seek to perceive the inner
anatomy of art and philosophy:

What is style? . .

What constitutes the aesthetic? How may this
be accomplished?

What is art? Music? Sculpture? Dance?
Poetry?

What is science? Mathematics?

Is art purely the man-made: The sound of

' the human voice, or playing music upon
man-made instruments? The painting and
sculpting of man with hand-held tools?

Is art a part of life, embracing: The ordin-
ary, the animal and natural sounds? The
patterns carved by the winds, sands, and
the water?

Is art perceptual, a mere fleeting moment or
experience in time, or is it permanent, en- -
during?

What is the optimum role of man in a cyber-
netic society?

What is the role of art in a technology-ori-
ented world?

What is the symbiosis of man-and-the-machine?

What is thinking?

What is creativity?

Is man the measure of all things?

When man uses the computer as an aid in creation,
or when he attempts to create heuristic art, his
mind finds new questions to explore and to answer.
It appears highly possible that a renewed perception
of life and the arts awaits present and future gen-
erations of man, and that this’ may be partially ac-
complished by eliminating the boundaries of compart-
mentealized disciplines, and by walking freely be-
tween art and science, by combining interdisciplin-
ary practices and materials, to hopefully bring
forth the ideal of an open, growing, and dimensional
perception of art/life for the human rate.

CORRECTION

In the July 1973 issue of Computers and Automation,
a single article entitled "Communication — Three-

Way: Chimpanzee, Man, Computer" was published. Part
1 was authored by Larry B. Dendy of the Public Rela-
tions Office of the University of Georgia and Part 2
was authored by Ernst von Glasersfeld et al of the
University of Georgia and the Yerkes Regional Prim-
ate Research Center of Emory University.

In compliance with the authors’ wishes, the two
parts of that article have been reprinted as two
separate articles. The first article is authored
solely by Larry B. Dendy and is titled, “Communica-
tion — Three Way: Chimpanzee, Man, Computer." The
second article is authored by Ernst von Glasersfeld
and his colleagues from the Yerkes Primate Research
Center and Georgia State University and is titled,
“A Computer Mediates Communication with a Chimpanzee.”
Also, and in compliance with the authors’ wishes, ali
figures and tables of the article as published in
the July 1973 issue have been included in the second
of these articles. 7

In the 1973 annual index Computers and Automation
will enter the two articles in this manner, which
serves to separate a regular article from a formal
scientific and technical report.

Virtue, in Spite of Erroneous

Conceptions

“We think of knowledge as knowing how-to-do-it, wisdom as knowing whether-to-do-it,
end virtue (if the answer is yes} as doing-it:”

In this article, I mean virtue in a much narrower
sense than the theologians, and IJ mean erroneous con-
ceptions in a much broader sense than planners of
parenthood.

Let me first speak of virtue.

We think of knowledge as knowing how-to-do-it,
wisdom as knowing whether-to-do-it, and virtue as
doing it. In this sense, at least in the universi-
ties, we think of scientists as knowing, the human-
ists as wise, and the engineers and other techni-
cians (doctors, nurses, social workers and the like)
as‘ virtuous, that is, the do-ers,

The World is Full of Problems

Now the world is full of problems where we need to
know how to do it, whether to do it, and (if the an-
swer is yes) to do it. Each of us can make his own
ist of pressing social problems: poliution, arms
limitation, or population growth. Fortunately we are
reasonably well supplied with scientists, humanists,
and technicians, To understand why we still have
these urgent problems, let us turn to erroneous con-
ceptions.

The erroneous conceptions I wish to deal with
here are:

That it is within the power of scientists and
engineers to choose to work only on projects
“in the public interest,” and .

That the market place is where one discovers
the public interest.

Choice of Projects to Work on
Critics seem to assume that scientists and engi-

heers are free to choose their projects, and complain
that they fail to consider the real public interest.

Based on remarks delivered on Joseph C. Wilson Day, November 10,
1972, at the University of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y.

have no more to say about how their discoveries are
used than Christopher Columbus did.

As for the engineers, they have more to say about
the uses of science, since they are the ones who
choose which of science's ideas will be applied, but
they in turn have almost no way, at present, of iden-
tifying the public interest, and even less in determ-
ining which products or processes should be produced
to serve it.

A Moratorium on Science?

We will return to this. matter of choice, but first
let's eliminate from the list of reasonable alterna-
tives facing society, the silly and dangerous notion
of a moratorium on science.

The key notion in the moratorium idea is that if
you can't control it, you shouldn't do it. There-
fore, we are urged, don't do any more science until
(presumably) the humanists devise suitable controls.
The trouble with this kind of conceptual contracep-
tion is two-fold, In the first place, as Paul Salt-
man has pointed out eloquently, you can't forbid
knowing any more than you can forbid writing poetry.
Science can be slowed down, of course, by driving it
underground, but even if we slowed it way down, there
is no evidence that we have either knowledge or wis-
dom enough to control its application, unless we
change some of our habits.

,

ignorance and Fear Lead to Irrationality

One habit that needs correction has to do with the
thinking and feeling processes of the humanists —
the philosophers, if you will — who presumably are
to show us how to behave, Too often théy are igno-
rant or fearful of science and engineering. What one
is ignorant or fearful of, he cannot deal with in a
rational way. There is no possibility that we can
learn to control what we do by some non-rational
process, such as satori, using mystically-fashioned
playing cards, etc. Control over what we do will
have to be done rationally. I also believe that it
will have to be done by humanists, and that before
they can do it, we have somehow to lower, or at least
make more permeable, the barrier that separates the
Two Cultures, We will come back to this point later.
Before that, let us return to the notion that engi-
neers choose what they will work on.

The Choices of Engineers

Most engineers do not make cosmic choices. They
do not decide that this product will be built and
that one won't be. Practically all engineers, I sus-
pect, work for other engineers, who work for others,
who work in companies where the products are deter-
mined not by science or philosophy, but by market
analysis, Now market analysis has come a long way
since the days of the Edsel,’ and it often guesses

rately, although not always so, what the public
4% interested in buying. But what the public buys is
mot necessarily what it needs.

The Market-Place Guessing Game

We buy those things that are offered for sale
that are better (in some vague way) than the alter-
matives available to us, Except for advertising or
other ways of influencing public opinion, the basic
mechanism of the market-place is a guessing game.
Try this product, see if it sells. If it does, fig-
ure out what it was about it that sold, and push a
little harder, If this one does not sell, retrench
a little, or gamble on another change — and so on.
Advertising and public opinion do play important
roles — how else explain so many different labels
on the same bar of soap, the same automobile? —
but the decision as to how the engineers’ skills
will be used has, in the past, been largely deter-
mined by the instantaneous outcome of the market
game.

Major Civil Problems

Now please do not misunderstand me. The market-
Place mechanisms are important for determining soap
or automobile styles, I believe that criteria of
visk-and-return of investment are elements of our
decision-making processes that we could discard only
at great peril to our society. What I am saying is
that the major civi) problems: pollution, poverty,
and population density, for examples, are not likely

_ to be defined by market analysis,

These problems, for which acceptable solutions
are needed, share these characteristics:

First, they cross product classification lines,
and involve more than one sector of the economy.
They are not just problems of the auto industry, or
the mining companies, or manufacturing-but-not-
service-industries — they involve al) of these.
All the skills that all these sectors employ may
have to be applied to these problems. The cement
plants in the country and the transport companies in
the city have pollution problems that differ only in
detail. To expect them to do the necessary research
and development. separately, each with his eye on his
own segment of the market, is to postpone until
much too late, if not forever, solving even the
smaller parts of our problems, The problems, so to
speak, are too big.

These Problems are Hardly Separable

In the same way, the major civil problems are not
readily separable. One can reduce the amount of air

pollution caused by internal combustion engines by
using electric autos, for example. If so, we may
replace polluted air in the cities with polluted
streams out in the country where the new massive
power plants are. Or we can replace with solar
energy the fissionable materials or fossil fuels we
now use for power; however, at least in the near
future, we would then have either much less energy
or much more costly energy, and fewer jobs and more
poverty. (Some among us tend to paint even blacker
pictures. They point out that our society gave up
slavery only when our technology developed to the
point where machines were cheaper than slaves. Is
it possible that we could deliberately reverse this
process and end up with clean air, but with slaves?)

This characteristic of tight linkage, or insep-
arability of the big problems, also suggests that
we cannot rely upon the ordinary market-place mech-
anisms to determine how we employ our technology to
solve our problems.

Very Difficult Problems

The third characteristic of our problems that
forces us to reconsider the mechanisms of choice,
is that our problems are so very difficult. The
technical solutions do not exist outside of social
considerations. The social costs outweigh such us-
ual factor costs as materials, labor, and capital.
Our cities present much tougher problems than put-
ting man on the moon. As someone smarter than but
unknown to me, has said, "We couldn't have put a
man on the moon if the moon had been inhabited", -

World-wide and Nation-wide Problems

All these characteristics, and others that I’ve
left out, such as geographical diversity — some
problems are not local, nor even regional or nation-
al, but world-wide — suggest that the organizations
needed for these new problem-solving teams differ
considerably from these of even our biggest, most

diversified companies, or else that we need some

super-industrial team of coordinators, who are to be
responsive not to the elements of the market-place,
but rather to the public interest, Whether that
public is regional, or national or world-wide, some-
one who has thought this problem further through
must tell, My own thoughts, tempered by a certain
sourly pragmatic view of the interactions of vari-
ous national governments, suggests that the approach
most likely to succeed in the near future is the na-
tional one.

The National Science Policy and Priorities Act

The essentials of a first step in a national plan
are contained in the National Science Policy and
Priorities Act, which, among other things, sets up
procedures for contracting out to universities, com-
panies and other organizations, the research and de-
velopment necessary for solution of the major civil
problems, including the design of civil science sys-
tems. Whether an agency like NASA should be set up,
as the Act says, or whether an existing agency
should supervise new programs, is a matter of de-
bate. The importance to our discussion is that some
federal funding agency, not the various product
market-places, should establish the priorities and
fund the solutions to our civil problems.

As you see, this bill or Act or plan makes a
first approach to nationalizing the solution to na-

tinnal neahlame Ae thn mama tien fe wet diane 1-2-9

’

collections of scientific, humanistic and engineer-
ing talent, that either already exist in the aero-
space companies, universities and think tanks, or
can be collected there. In essence, this bill
solves one aspect of the problem, It replaces small
or local or single-commodity market-places with a
national market-place based on national needs. I
suspect that the new agency will find that big aero-~
space companies usually do not have the necessary
mix of talents, although they probably do have the
necessary organization. The universities, on the
other hand, probably do have the necessary mix of
talents, but probably do not have the proper organ-
ization. It seems, however, to be a logical first
step, and the sooner the bill becomes law, the
sooner we can begin to solve our problems.

international Institute of Applied Systems Analysis

An example of the international approach is the
recently established International Institute of Ap-
pliei-Systems Analysis in Vienna as a joint venture
of our National Academy of Sciences and the Soviet
Academy, among others. Since they will operate on
about three-and-a-half million dollars a year (the
Civil Science part of the National Science Policy
and Priorities Act allots an average of 270 million
per year for three years) it is unreasonable to ex-
pect anything more than papers for publication to
come out of Vienna. The international effort will
result in more knowledge and wisdom; on the pro-
posed national budget we could become virtuous as
well,

In Order to be Virtuous
One Must be Wise and Knowing

One final caution. I hope you have not heard
me suggest that only scientists and engineers are
capable of leading us out of the thicket of diffi-
culties we are in. I am not advocating technocracy,
that totalitarian philosophy which says that only
engineers can lead us, TI do not believe that tor
one moment, nor does anyone who knows enough engi-
neers and scientists. There is no reason to believe
that they, as a class, are any more capable of
leading our people than, say, the lawyers.

I would rather that you heard me say that no
longer is it virtue merely to do it, but rather
that in order to be virtuous one must also be wise
and also knowing. :

Our Leaders Must Se Part Scientist,
Part Humanist, and Part Engineer

We will need new kinds of agencies and organiza-
tions to define "the public interest" and to find
ways of organizing the talents that may solve some
of our problems. But organizations — universities
and corporations and public agencies — are built by
people, led by other people. So our leaders must be
part scientist, part humanist, and part engineer,
and they must use what they have, not in response to
some particular market-place, but in the true public
interest, Not nearly enough people will be born .
with these characteristics. They will have to be
educated,

If this sounds like a very tall order to put to
an education system — it is. .

But we should be encouraged to redesign our edu-
cation systems to help produce such people, not only
because we have to (God knows we do) if mankind is

too survive — but also because we know it is pos-
“sible,

NUMBLES

Neil Macdonald
Assistant Editor
Computers and Automation

A “numble” is an arithmetical problem in which: digits
have been replaced by capital letters; and there are two
messages, one which can be read right away and a second
one in the digit cipher. The problem is to solve for the
digits.

Each capital letter in the arithmetical problem stands for
just one digit 0 to 9. A digit may be represented by more
than one letter. The second message, which is expressed in
numerical digits, is to be translated (using the same key)
into letters so that it may be read; but the spelling uses
puns or is otherwise irregular, to discourage cry ptanalytic
methods of deciphering. .

We invite our readers to send us solutions, together with |
human programs or computer programs which will produce
the solutions.

Part 1 of “Nixon and the Mafia" was published in

the September issue of “Computers and Automation" ;
Part 2, in the October issue. Part 3 begins here

with further information about the relation of
4 President-to-be Richard M. Nixon with shady trans-
actions in the Bahamas.

Shakeup in the Bahamas

By the middle Sixties there was a storm brewing.
Internal friction had forced out a few people like
Lou Chesler, while a wave of public investigations
were blaring the role of underworld figures like
Meyer Lansky. The 1967 Royal Commission of Inquiry
also dredged up another familiar name — Richard
Nixon.

Testimony before the Royal Commission by Max
Courteney, a Lansky lieutenant, detailed a long
bookmaking career and brought out the names of a
large clientele, including the then ex-Vice Presi-
dent Richard Nixon.

Mary Carter Paint

The Royal Commission also bared a deal which im-
plicated Richard Nixon far more deeply than passing
mention by an underground bookie.

In 1967 Lyndon Pindling became the first black
premier ever to serve the almost one hundred percent
black citizenry of the island. Pindling was hardly
@ revolutionary, however, for among the people in-
strumental in putting him in office was a gambler
close to Lansky named Mike McLaney. The Royal Com-
mission branded McLaney a “thoroughly dangerous per-
son" and accused him of maneuvering Pindling into at
least one deal involving a questionable gambling
concession.

Part of the post-election controversy was a com-
pany based in Tampa which bore the innocuous name of
“Mary Carter Paint Company". :

In 1965 Lansky's front-man (and former Key Bis-
cayne landowner) Wallace Groves, filed a joint ap-
plication with the Mary Carter Company to open a

casino on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The ubiq-
uitous Sir Stafford Sands handled the legalities.
Knowledgeable observers looked for the mystery man,
and a Justice Department memo, dated January 18,
1966, predicted that “the atmosphere seems ripe for
a Lansky skim".

After Pindling's election, Groves was forced out
and the Mary Carter Paint Company had itself two new
casinos. At the 1967 opening of one of them — the
Nassau Bay Club — the honored guest was Richard
Nixon,

The following year — 1968 — the othey. Mary Car-
ter Club, the Paradise Island Casino, opened for
business. The owners felt close enough to Nixon to
offer him use of their facilities during the 1968
Republican Convention. Nixon felt more comfortable
at Key Biscayne, but some of his staff took up the
offer.

Mary Carter Becomes Resorts International

In 1969 Mary Carter — now called Resorts Inter-
national — reluctantly "released" one Dino Cellini,
claiming that while he “had a relatively unsavory
background, he had no criminal record, no criminal
associates". Cellini hopped across the water to
Miami, where, according to Dade County Sheriff In-
telligence Reports, he continued to work in conjunc~
tion with Paradise Island Casino, The reports al-
lege that Cellini was an almost daily visitor to Re-
sorts International's Miami office, where he checked
eredits and worked with a company booking junkets to
the Paradise Island Casino.

There are those who maintain that Cellini's con-
nections with Resorts International symbolize the
influence of Lansky. In a 197) editorial, the Las
Vegas Sun concluded an eleven part series on organ-
ized crime — some of which centered on Resorts In-
ternational — by charging that "however cloaked and
cleverly concealed by the guardians, gambling in the
Bahamas is controlled by Meyer Lansky and it has
been established in police intelligence reports that
the fee is fifteen percent of the gross income". The
now defunct Toronto. Telegram reported in 1970 that
“observers believe that the resourceful Lansky is
still managing to get his cut from the Bahamas”.

Resorts International, through its ninety-one
percent owned subsidiary, Intertel, has denied all
ellegations of involvement with organized crime. It
13-00000

was Intertel that ITT hired in 1972 to snoop on col-
‘umnist Jack Anderson,

The latest and possibly most damaging charge in
the Resorts International battle came in June 1972
in an IRS inspired indictment of Meyer Lansky and

“Pino Cellini. The indictment reads in part:

On or about May 17, 1968, unindicted co-conspira-
tor Vincent Teresa met with defendants Meyer Lan-
sky and Dino Cellini in Miami and had a discus-
sion wherein defendants Lansky and Cellini gave
Teresa permission to conduct gambling junkets to
the Paradise Island Casino.

Thus government agents allege that in 1968 Lan-
sky maintained at least some control in running jun-
kets to Resorts International's Paradise Island Cas-
ino. The junket racket is an integral part of the
casino operation, and as recently as 1971 Lansky's
embert Eddie Cellini was reportedly still arranging
junkets for the Paradise Island Casino.

Enter Nixon and Rebozo

It was in 1967 — with Lansky still okaying jun-
kets and Cellini still running the Paradise Island
Casino — that Richard Nixon and Bebe Rebozo became
friends with the head of Resorts International.

It should be no surprise that James Golden, the
recently (1969) hired "deputy director of security”
for Resorts International is a good friend of Nix-
on's. As a Secret Service guard for Nixon when he
was Vice President, Golden made a good enough im-
pression to be appointed staff security chief for
Nixon in 1968. Golden was also security director
of Nixon's convention headquarters in Miami that
year, and was security director for his subsequent
inauguration. Later that year he moved to Resorts
International. Golden is just one of along string
of interesting Nixon security appointees, among
them Watergate indictees James McCord, Gordon Liddy,
and Howard Hunt.

There are rumors, some of which have been aired
in the press, that Richard Nixon owns stock in Re-
sorts International. Former Republican Presidential
candidate Thomas E. Dewey does own stock in the com-
peny, and, according to organized crime investigator
Hank Messick among others, there are reports of Lan-
sky buying stock as well. Nobody has proved any-
thing one way or another about the stock connec-
tions, but that Nixon is connected to Resorts Inter-
national, at least through Golden, is indisputable.

Perhaps more disquieting than rumors of Nixon
stock ownership in an underworld holding company for
Bahamian casinos dre the reports of his meddling in
Bahamian affairs. In 1969 a proposed tax increase
on gambling profits to provide money for Bahamian
schools was slashed in half by the Minister of Fi-
mance. The Minister refused to explain the cut,
and told opposition members to “use your imagina-
tion” for an explanation.

The advice was taken literally by some Bahamian
papers who speculated that pressure came from “out-
side sources connected with casinos". One Bahamian
Paper asked openly if "a telephone call from the
White House was not responsible?” .

Whereas our investigation into Cuban politics
brought evidence to light possible violations of the
Neutrality Act, we now have the possibility of an
American President who has spent a significant
amount of his vacation time in the Bahamas also med-
dling in the affairs of that country.

Richard Nixon, a man with both visible and invis-
ible links to the underworld and politics of pre-
Castro Cuba, turns up in the Bahamas with very simi-
lar links, bringing some big names along with him.

Enter William Rogers

Two men with histories both in Bahamian politics
and in the finances of organized crime have made
frequent use of the legal services of a firm whose
most prominent partner is Richard Nixon's old friend
William P. Rogers, one-time Secretary of State.

The two men are Mike McLaney, charged by the
Royal Commission in 1967, and a business cohort of
his named William Colusardo. McLaney and Colusardo
were investigated in 1967 by the Securities and Ex-
change Commission in connection with a blueberry
plantation that McLaney sold to a company controlled
by Colusardo. The subsequent corporate jugglings
implicated (among others) newly elected Bahamian
Premier Lyndon Pindling. Among Colusardo's "favors"
for Pindling were the use of his airplane during the
election campaign, and a $127,000 contribution in
the form of an “interest payment". The law firm
that defended McLaney and Colusardo against the SEC
was that of William P. Rogers. ‘Rogers had been a
close friend and political associate of Nixon's for
twenty-five years. He accompanied Nixon on many of
his Bahamian jaunts and also made frequent stops
with him at the Key Biscayne Inn and Villas. In ad-
dition to being an "R & R" sidekick, Rogers was the
man Nixon turned to for counsel amidst his personal
crises in the Checkers affair and Eisenhower's seri-
ous heart attack.

Rogers served the Eisenhower/Nixon team for eight
years in the Department of Justice, first as Deputy
Attorney General, and then, by 1957, as Attorney
General. The Justice Department's record against
organized crime in the years following the Kefauver
Commission was lackluster, to say the least. It was
Rogers who personally rejected the recommendations
of the specially constituted Wessell Committee on
organized crime set up in the wake of the infamous
Appalachian raid in upstate New York that revealed
a Mafia summit conference. The Committee's propos-
als for a concentrated and coordinated war on or-
ganized crime were only implemented some years later
by Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

A footnote in the Justice Department files was a
report by IRS Special Agent Josph Delfine, dated Oc-
tober 19, 1953. The IRS recommended to the Justice
Department that "criminal proceedings be instituted
against Meyer Lansky in the Southern Judicial Dis-
trict of New York for the willful attempt to defeat
and evade a large portion of his income taxes for
the years 1945 and 1947 under section 145b of the
Internal Revenue Code". The Justice Department —
with William Rogers second in command at the time —
respectfully declined to prosecute.

Lums Hot Dogs

Upon leaving his post as Attorney General in
1960, Rogers became a member of the New York firm of
Royal, Koegel and Wells. In 1969, with its leading
partner about to become Secretary of State, Royal,
etc, moved with its clients wholeheartedly into the
world of gambling casinos and organized crime.

A year later Royal took on the account of the
Miami-based hot dog chain, Lums Inc. What did a hot
dog chain have to offer a prestigious New York law
firm? The answer may lie in where the firm took its
client.
13-00000

In 1969 Lums purchased the Ceasar's Palace Hote!
and Casino in Las Vegas for $60,000,000. A month
later the Nevada state gambling authorities were
looking into the hotels’ "catering to twelve under-
world figures from Kansas City”.

A few months after the purchese the SEC filed
suit charging Lums and Ceasar's Palace with “false
and misleading" statements. The SEC wondered how
Ceasar's managed to lose $1,000,000 in five months
when the previous year (before Lums bought in) there
was a $2,200,000 profit for a comparable time period.

The SEC also questioned Lums concerning the
$3,500,000 Lums paid one Jerome Zarowitz, aconvicted
professional sports fixer who wasn't even listed as
.an owner of the casino. Top officiais in both Cea-
sar's end Lums have been under investigation by IRS
intelligence in Miami and by Nevada gaming authori-

re in cases involving organized crime ever since
Regers' firm took on the Lums account.

There is also the question of the 1971 Lums ac-
quisition of a North Miami housing resort develop-
ment called Sky Lakes. Both Sky Lakes and Ceasar's
Palace have received large sums of money from the
Teamsters — $12,000,000 for the Miami project and
more than $16,000,000 for Ceasar's Palace.

With things going slowly, Lums announced plans
for a new $22,000,000 casino next door to Ceasar's
Palace. In December of 1971 the company decided
that the whole restaurant idea was no longer worth
the trouble. In a classic climax to a classic Amer-
ican success they changed their name to Ceasar's
World Inc. and sold their hot dog stands.

Meanwhile the Secretary of State's old law firm
reaped a bundle with their new-found involvement in
the Las Vegas underworld. With such stunning suc-
cesses at home, one wonders what a firm with a link
to the Secretary of State could do abroad, in places
like the Bahamas or Vietnam, for example.

Nor do the underworld implications of big names
surrounding Nixon end with the Secretary of State.
Murray Chotiner. a long-time Nixon aide and archi-
tect of his early smear campaigns, has past links to
the underworld. In 1962 Drew Pearson and Jack An-
derson wrote that “Chotiner ... besides representing
the top gangster of Philadelphia, Marco Reginelli,
represented a long and amazing list of hoods, con-
cession peddlers, income tax violators and others
needing influence in high places ..." It was Chot-
iner who brought Frank Vitale, “once involved in
the biggest bootlegging conspiracy on the West
Coast," ontoNixon's special plane to Moscow in 1959.

Nixon's recent appointment of Walter Annenberg as
Ambassador to England also echoes the themes of un-
derworld involvement. Annenberg and his father were
indicted in 1939 for "aiding and abetting” in con-
nection with their wire service operation inChicago,
an Operation run with the protection of Al Capone,
for which the Annenbergs paid $1,000,000. The An-
nenberg family wag also a major contributor to Nix-
on's 1966 election campaign.

Further back in the Nixon saga, and closer to his
southern California birthplace, lies San Diego fin-
ancier, C. Arnholdt Smith and his bookmaker partner
John Alessio. In 1946 Alessio and Smith introduced
Nixon to another bookmaker named Lew Lipinsky. Lip-
insky, who was convicted for bookmaking in 1938,
served for three decades as a go-between for the
Sai th/Alessio interests to their syndicate connec~

ons.

Some of the dealings of the Smith/Alessio combine
were brought to national prominence by a recent LIFE
magazine article which accused Attorney General
Richard Kleindienst of “tampering with justice" in a
case involving Alessio, According to the Wall Street
Journal, Smith raised $1,000,000 for Nixon's 1968
campaign. He and his wife took the first position
on the receiving line behind the President at the
White House inauguration.

More of the Same in California

Nixon's other favorite resting place besides Key
Biscayne is the area near his birthplace in southern
California. Here the underworld pattern of his
Florida involvements repeats itself — in a strik-
ingly similar pattern.

One story there involves Nixon's multi-million-
aire backer, C. Arnholdt Smith, and the Del Charro
Hotel in La Jolla, just north of San Diego.

The Del Charro was a favorite stopover for Nixon
in the Fifties. Owned by the Murchison brothers,
who also owned the nearby De] Mar race track, the
hotel played host to numerous Detroit and Las Vegas
gangsters. Alan Witwer, a former. manager of the
hotel, has alleged in statements to this repofter and
“others that the hotel served as a secret meeting
place for politicians and assorted business inter-
ests, some of them from the underworld. Witwer spe-
cifically cited a 1954 meeting attended by Nixon and
chaired by a leading member of ITT. He also claimed
that there was a bookmaking operation at the hotel,
but has offered no documented proof.

Mrs. C. Arnholdt Smith is a permanent resident of
the Del Charro, and the hotel's visitors have in-
cluded John Connally, Barry Goldwater, and J. Edgar
Hoover. Hoover's $15,000-a-year bills were picked
up by the stockholders of the Murchison interests.

The fact that certain of Hoover's good friends
rubbed elbows, rather warmly, with Meyer Lansky, and
the fact that the nation's leading crime fighting
agency — the FBI — has come up almost blank in its
fight against organized crime may not prove anything
about Hoover. On the other hand, these facts don't
make it any easier to dismiss questions which might
arise about the influence of organized crime at the
highest levels of government.

North of the Del Charro and thirty miles south of
the San Clemente White House, lies the mammoth La
Costa land resort development. The development is
tied to both Smith (his daughter is a director) and
to the Teamsters.

LaCosta was originally developed by Cleveland
syndicate reliables Allard Roen and Moe Dalitz. The
development was reorganized in 1968 to bring Team-
ster control more in line with their investments,
which already exceeded $18,000,000. Like Sky Lakes,
its Florida counterpart, La Costa attracts a whole
range of figures from organized crime. La Costa
visitors have included Willie “Ice Pick” Alderman,
a St. Louis mob cohort Morris Shenker, and Wallace
Groves and Lou Chesler of Bahamas fame.

According to eyewitnesses, when Groves’ helicop-
ter sets down, the red carpet is rolled out. It may
be because Groves bought a home in La Costa, but
more likely it's because, as government agents put
it, “where Groves appears, Meyer Lansky will not be
far behind”.

Another mob frequenter of the La Costa develop-
ment is Jake Arvey, an organizer of the Republic

nard Barker channeled funds for the Watergate crime.

The Teamsters Again

A recent visitor to La Costa was Frank Fitzsim-
mons, a key to Nixon's new-found support in organ-
ized labor. Fitzsimmons is president of the Team-
sters Union, This summer he stopped in La Costa on
his way to see Nixon at San Clemente. Fitzsimmons
had just come from dinner in Detroit with a local

Mafia figure and soon after his Detroit-La Costa-San ©

Clemente excursion, Fitzsimmons announced his sup-
port for Nixon. One wonders whether the Teamster
decision to stay on the Pay Board and to support
Nixon is somehow related to what the Detroit Free
Press has been hinting strongly as of late: that the
administration has stopped prosecution of Frank's
son Richard Fitzsimmons — the business partner of a
Detroit mobster — on charges of missing union funds,
im™Sichange for Teamster support of the Republican
President.

Whatever deals Nixon and Fitzsimmons did make,
the Teamsters have a long working relationship with
organized crime. Their marriage goes back over
twenty years, where Jimmy Hoffa was introduced to
the Detroit underworld by Paul Dorfman, in exchange
for some multi-million dollar insurance business.
Dorfman's son, Paul, has residences at both Sky
Lakes and La Costa and was recently convicted of
taking kickbacks on a Teamster loan.

The Teamster tradition of labor racketeering and
corruption made for a ready alliance with the mob.
Early government investigations of the Teamsters,
such as the Bobby Kennedy-led McClellan Permanent
Committee on Investigations, centered on labor rac-
keteering. As Attorney General, Kennedy continued
his pursuit of the Teamsters and their boss, Jimmy
Hoffa. At one point Kennedy had twenty-nine grand
juries simultaneously investigating Hoffa's activity
— one of which led to a conviction for mail fraud
and jury tampering.

-In 1969, two Oakland Tribune reporters concluded
a six-month investigation with the charge that "the
$628,000,000 Teamsters Central States, Southeast and
Southwest Pension Fund headquartered in Chicago, has
become a bankroll for some of America's most sinis-
ter underground figure".

Nowhere does the relationship between this fund
and the mob surface more dramatically than in Las
Vegas, where Teamster trustees have approved loans
between $50 and $70,000,000, some shakily secured by
second mortgages and subordinated notes. A high-
ranking Federal official has commented that “the
Teamster fund is a sort of open bank to people well-
connected in Las Vegas and well-connected to organ-
ized crime",

It was Hoffa's desire "to have [his] own bank in
every city" that brought on the Teamster takeover of
the Miami National Bank. The Bank in turn is just
one of a long list of ventures, suchas Ceasar’s Pal-
ace, Sky Lakes, La Costa, Worldwide Realty, Interna-
tional Airport Hotel Systems, Truesdale Estates, in
which Teamster money amounting to over $60,000,000
figures prominently alongside the social and busi-
hess partners of Richard M. Nixon — a line of in-
vestments that leads from Nixon's three White Houses
to a Federal clemency for Jimmy Hoffa and back to

- Organized crime.

The current head of the Justice Department's
Criminal Division saw enough evidence in 1967 to say

that he “knew for a moral certainty [that] in the
upper echelons there is an amalgamation between the
Cose Nostra and the Teamsters Union". In 1971, when
a Federal Grand Jury probing the activities of Meyer
Lansky questioned Jimmy Hoffa, many wondered whether
the links between the two giants were more direct
than the numerous transactions between mutual
friends.

A few months after his testimony, Hoffa was
granted clemency after serving less than five years
of his thirteen-year sentence. The freeing of Hoffa
and three co-defendents of the 1963 wire fraud pen-
sion case is the latest and most crucial event in
Nixon's longstanding friendship, a friendship with
some clear public benefits for both. Jack Anderson
documents, for example, that as early as 1960, then
Vice-President Nixon and Attorney General Rogers in-
tervened to halt an indictment against Hoffa in ex-
change for Hoffa's support in the 1960 election.

ANICO — More of the Same in Texas

In recent years the Teamster fund has been super-
seded by a giant Texas insurance company as a major
source of finance for Las Vegas .casinos tied to the
mob. The company is the American National Insurance
Company (ANICO) of Galveston, Texas. ANICO is close
to the heart and pocketbook of the two ranking Tex-
ans in the Nixon administration — former Treasury
Secretary John Connally and former Assistant Attor-
ney General Will Wilson.

As well as floating more than $40,000,000 to Las
Vegas casinos and $13,000,000 to premier mob attor-
ney Morris Shanker, ANICO has made loans to two
Florida companies close to Richard Nixon —
$1,750,000 in 1966 to the Mary Carter Paint Company,
and $3,000,000 in 1970 to a subsidiary of Worldwide
Realty. .

That year a group of disenchanted stockholders
filed a multi-million-dollar suit, charging ANICO
officials with having taken control of the company
and using it as a private preserve as well as a
source of funds for the mob. -

The defendants in the suit hired Nixon's New York
firm to handle the case. Connally's Houston law
firm has also been used by ANICO. The First Na-
tional Bank of Houston, ofwhich Connally was a di-
rector and in which some of his law partners were
officers, has provided -an interest-free account of
more than $1,000,000 for ANICO. Connally was also
a director of a savings association which was pur-
chased recently by ANICO.

Will Wilson was "general" of the Justice Depart-
ment's "war" on crime from 1969-1971. He was head
of the Criminal Division until October 1971, when
his resignation was forced by disclosures tying him
to the scandal-rocked financial empire of Texas
wheeler-dealer Frank Sharp. Wilson has been charged
by dissident ANICO stockholders of helping to drag
ANICO into the twilight zones of finance with such
deals as the 1963 absorption of a defaulted $150,000
mortgage held by Sharp. Sharp's attorney and “finan-
cial advisor" on the deal was Will Wilson.

°

While Attorney General of Texas, Wilson sued the
foundation which controlled AXICO to bring three new
trustees onto the foundation's board of directors.
Wilson has no visible ties to the new trustees,
whose votes were instrumental in shaping the com-
pany's new financial course. But dissident stock-
holders have charged that the “negotiations” that

.

-eerning ANICO remain:

*" brought on the shift of control in the foundations

were handled by a Galveston law firm linked to the
mob. The stockholders also claim that John Connally
played a role in these negotiations, albeit a "back-
stage" role. The ANICO case is part of a long his-
tory of Wilson's involvement with the Galveston un-
derworld.

When he came to the Justice Department in Wash-
ington, Wilson discovered the organized crime divi-
sion looking into the affairs of ANICO. Since then
there have been no indictments in the case and there
are reports that Wilson had the ANICO files locked
safely in his personal office. One source of those
reports is Stewart Hopps, a former Justice Depart-
ment investigator.

Some serious conflict-of-interest charges con-
to
-The officers of ANICO who were later represented

by Nixon's law firm, made a loan to a company
whose top officers are long-time friends of Nixon.

@ The criminal division of the Justice Department
has been headed by a man with direct links in a
company the division is supposedly investigating.

©@ The company also has clear ties to Nixon's former
Tressury Secretary, a man mentioned for the Vice-
Presidency, the national chairman of Democrats
for Nixon, and a key figure in the President's
re-election scheme.

Whose Justice Department?

The ANICO case takes us to a fitting endpoint to
the story of Richard Nixon's involvement with the
underworld — the Department of Justice. It is an
old saw that criminal] and criminal-chaser eventually
become involved in the same business, but in Richard
Nixon that old saw has become more of a reality than
perhaps ever before in American history. For Rich-
ard Nixon is a man whose name has been synonymous
with "law and order" in America for three decades.

Yet the four-year “war” on organized crime by the
Nixon administration bears more resemblance to the
"peace" in Vietnam than a sincere effort to get at
the mob.

In a recent interview in U.S. News and World Re-
port (September 11, 1972), Attorney Generali Richard
Kleindienst hailed “about 1600" indictments of un-
derworld figures brought by the Nixon administration
in the past three and half years. The Justice De-
partment claims that many of these indictments in-
volve top mobsters.

Those outside the Nixon administration, however,
have charged that the government's prosecution has
been both partisan and selective, aimed exclusively
at mobsters linked to big-city Democrats such as in
Newark, and at the “little fish" who are always in
abundance and who make little difference in conduct-
ing mob business. Time has reported that quotas
have been established (i.e. one hundred hoodlums a

month for New York City) and that arrests are "being. .- |.

delayed so that future quotas can be filled", The
New York Times has editorialized about the ease with
which petty gamblers can and have~been rounded up,
and wondered aloud if the Justice Department isn't
conducting more a publicity war than one on organ-
ized crime. A Times report this year found the gov-
ernment was building up a backlog of gambling in-
dictments, saving them for a crucial time during the
election campaign. :

Indeed, while the Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell team has
used the spectre of "CRIME" to keep the fear level
high and to guarantee large budgets and expanded
powers for their Justice Department, the actual “at-
tempts" of the Nixon administration to cope with or-
ganized crime have resembled a somewhat sinister up-
date of the Keystone Cops.

For example, up to 1,000 of Kieindienst's vaunted
1600 indictees in gambling and organized crime may
have their cases thrown out for somewhat dubious
“improper procedures” technicalities. A Miami at-
torney named James Hogan has “discovered” irregular-
ities on signatures required for electronic surveil-
lance authorizations. Court-approved wiretaps re-
quire written authorization by the Attorney General
of a designated representative, in this case Will
Wilson. Instead of being signed by John Mitchell or
by Wilson, the authorizations in question were
signed by aides, thus rendering thousands of wiretap
authorizations —- and the indictments based on them
— useless.

Hogan himself is a long-time syndicate attorney
and a partner of Ben Cohen, a former political boss
of Miami Beach who figures prominently in the For-
ties‘ takeover of Miami by organized crime. The
case in which Hogan made his discovery involved the
busting of the largest heroin/cocaine ring én Miami,
many of whose members were Cuban refugees. Inspec-
tion of various court papers, including wiretap
authorizations, confirmed “irregularities” in the
signature — Will Wilson's signature. While resem-
bling his actual handwriting, the signatures ap-
peared as "Wil" instead of "Will".

While it may seem strange for an aide to misspell
his boss’ name, it seems even stranger that Hogan
took the case. His normal fees start in five fig-
ures but he has been working on behalf of his court-
declared indigent client for more than two years
with minimal compensation. While Hogan is known as
a "very thorough” attorney, it would be interesting
to find out more about the circumstances in which he
discovered the “irregularities”.

Even more interesting, perhaps, are the circum-
stances under which Richard Kleindienst was offered
a bribe of $100,000 to quash several mob indictments
In sworn testimony in November 1971, Kleindienst admit-
ted to being offered the $100,000 bribe (which would
be paid in the form of a contribution to Nixon's
1972 campaign) in exchange for stopping prosecution
against several underworld figures caught in @ stock
fraud case. The bribe was offered by an aide of
Senator Hiram Fong, a Republican from Hawaii. The
side had worked previously with Kelindienst through
Fong's position on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kleindienst said he refused the offer but he also.
said he did not realize it was a bribe for an entire
week!

In cross examination, the prosecutor asked Klein-
dienst, "If you had regarded the conversation as
something regarding a bribe offer you would have im-
mediately report it, would you not?"

“Yes sir," replied Kleindienst, "I would have.”

Kleindienst admitted he reported the bribe a full
week later, upon learning from J. Edgar Hoover that
Federal agents were investigating the case. |

One would expect the Attorney General of the

United States to be more alert. But what is more
troubling are reports aired in the Washington Post

.
13-00000

shortly after the indictments in the stock fraud
pase in question (and ten months before Klein-
dienst's testimony on the bribe). Those reports
uoted "sources at the U.S. Attorney's office in New
York" and indicated that after the meeting between
Kleindienst and Fong's aide, "Kleindienst immedi-
ately contacted Justice’s Criminal Division [then
headed by Will Wilson] and ... an FBI agent was as-
signed to infiltrate the group of alleged conspira-
tors".

Do we now believe Kleindienst's story that he
“didn't realize” he had been offered a bribe, or
do we believe the U.S. Attorney's office in New
York? Did Will Wilson and the Justice Department
hold off a week while Kleindienst “made up his
mind” that he had been offered a bribe, or was the
decision whether or not to take it? And did Hoover
and the FBI somehow interfere? ;

wBerhaps the answer comes in the final outcome of
the @ctual prosecution involved. The defendants in
the stock-fraud case included Meyer Lansky's son-in-
law, a former director of the Bank of Miami Beach
and Johnny Dio, a notorious racketeer long associ-
ated with Jimmy Hoffa. They were acquitted, while
the messengers who offered the bribe were convicted.
One wonders if that $100,000 did not find its way
into the Republican secret treasury after all.

The Tip of the Iceberg

"The organized criminal relies on physical terror
and psychological intimidation, on economic re-
taliation and political bribery, on citizen's in-
difference and government acquiescence. He cor-
Yrupts our governing institutions and subverts our
democratic processes."

— Richard Nixon, April 24, 1969

Someone should tell President Nixon that resist-
ing the power of organized crime demands, above all,
a President with a clean slate.

Nixon's life is like a complex jigsaw puzzle, the
pieces of which have been shuffled so as to defy
complete reconstruction. Some of the crucial pieces
have been removed, so a full picture cannot be
achieved. It is no accident that no other politi-
cian has been so much written about, yet so little
understood,

Indeed, much has been made of the “enigma” of
Richard Nixon, his tight-lipped bearing in relation
to his personal life, his unwillingness to divulge
what's really on his mind.

But maybe the answer to the enigma lies in his
old poker-playing instincts, in the unfailing abil-
ity to keep quiet when he's sitting on cards best
hidden from the table.

. For there is one indisputable fact about Richard
Nixon's career — his ascendancy to the pinnacle of
American power has required twenty-five years of
care and feeding by some very wealthy and very re-
actionary men, and an extraordinary number of them
have maintained connections with the world of or-
ganized crime.

During Nixon's years in office the underworld em-
pire in the United States has prospertd almost unre-
Stricted by the Federal government. From its base
in the gigantic resources of heroin traffic, gamb-
ling, prostitution, "protection," and a host of
other enterprises of violence against society, or-
ganized crime has moved like a bulldozer into the
world of legal, “respectable” business.

Every link between Richard Nixon and organized
crime, however marginal, is of significance, if for
no other reason because he is President. And there
are people all over America, from government intel-
ligence agents to hotel waiters, who have Nixon
stories to tell. He covers his tracks well, but not
well enough,

The full extent of Nixon's involvement with or-
ganized crime is just beginning to surface. The
evidence in this article is merely the top of a
dirty iceberg that will slowly become visible over
the coming years.

The milieu in which he has traveled for three
decades, and in which so many of his friends, as-
sociates, and appointees have been related to the
mob, throw a long and permanent shadow over every-
thing Richard Nixon the “public servant" has ever
said, and over everything his political life has
ever meant.

For in light of his career, both past and pres~
ent, Richard M. Nixon seems to be the factual em-
bodiment of Ralph Salerno's prediction that organ-
ized crime would someday put its own man in the
White House.

The information in this article was gathered
during a six-month investigation carried out in
many cities, primarily Miami, New York, Washington,
D.C., Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Dallas,
Austin, Galveston, Tallahassee, and San Francisco.
Sources included interviews with over a hundred
people; court documents (including deeds, mortgages,
etc.); research in the National Archives, Washing-
ton, D.C.; organized crime intelligence files (both
private and government); and newspaper clippings.

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical . . *

Computers and ‘Automation, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine inthe field of com-

puters and data processing, believes that the pro-
fession of information engineer includes not only
competence in handling information using computers
and other means, but also a broad responsibility,
in'a professional and engineering sense, for:

— The reliability and social significance of
pertinent input data;

— The social value and truth of the output
results. .

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-
fessional responsibility for the reliability and
significance of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human
beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes
from time to time articles and other information

related tosocially useful input and output of data
systems in @ broad sense, To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical
— but productive of thought and an improved and
safer "house" for all humanity, an earth in which
our children and later generations may have a fu-
ture, instead of facing extinction. °

The professional information engineer needs to
relate his engineering to the most important and
most serious problems in the world today: war,
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo-
sion, and many more, .

NATIONAL AMERICAN BANK INSTALLS
COMPUTER-BASED SECURITY SYSTEM

Tom Burbank

National American Bank
200 Carondelet

New Orleans, La. 70130

A computer-based system designed to prevent un-
authorized access to high security areas has gone
into operation at National American Bank here —
one of the first U.S. banks to install such a sys-
tem, The IBM Controlled Access System (CAS) at Na-
tional American is based on the use of magnetically
encoded, wallet-sized identification cards similar
to bank credit cards.

Each person authorized to enter a security area
is assigned a card coded with his own security num-
ber. Employees seeking entry to an area covered by
the system simply insert their cards into compact
Yeading devices on entrance doors, and. the informa-
tion is transmitted to an IBM System/7 computer for
identification.

Stored in the computer's memory is a list of em-
ployee numbers and building areas these numbers are
designated for. If the number of the card entitles
the bearer access to that area, the computer signals
the door to unlock. If the person is unauthorized
to enter, the door remains closed and a security
guard is notified. The elapsed time is approximately
one second.

If a card is lost or stolen, a new card (with a
new number) is issued and the system is alerted to
deny entry to the original card.” If the old card
is used, the guard is alerted.

As an additional safeguard, the system can auto-
matically log all entrance activity by individual
security code, door number, date and time of day.
This helps track who is where and for how long.
National American can now analyze the number of

assets stored in the bank,”

times an individual enters and at what time of day
or night this activity occurs. The system also has
built-in failsafe mechanisms which insure security
in the event of a power failure.

“Unfortunately, we are doing business in a time
when public and private institutions are increas-
ingly vulnerable to lawless elements,” said National
American President Louie J. Roussel III. "By adding
the IBM Controlled Access System to our current se-
curity procedures, we are taking a major step to in-
sure that our customers and employees are protected.
And, by controlling access to the collateral’ instru-
ment storage areas, we can make it very difficult
for unauthorized people to gain access to valuable

NOVA COMPUTER CHECKS STRENGTH
OF ROOF IN COAL MINE

Edgar E. Geithner
Data General Corp.
Southboro, Mass. 01772

Data General's minicomputers track hurricanes
from airplanes for the U.S. Air Force; the Army has
mounted them in helicopters; Scripps Oceanographic
Institute has one ‘on a ship; a scientist bounces
over Canadian glaciers with one mounted in his
tracked vehicle; and an oil company uses one of the
computers to control an oilfield in the Libyan des-
ert. Now engineers at the University of Texas (Aus-
tin) have a minicomputer in the bottom of a mine.

Dr. A. L. Podio, an assistant professor in the
university's Department of Petroleum Engineering,
and a team of researchers from the Center for Earth
Sciences and Engineering, use a Nova 820 computer to
detect possible weak spots in the roofs of mines.
The computer system, developed for the U.S. Bureau
of Mines, has been .on the job on the floor of Kaiser
Corporation's York Canyon coal mine in New Mexico.
"One of the most frequent causes of mine accidents
is roof collapse," Dr. Podio said. “This system was
designed to use the principles of seismic explora-
tions to identify failure planes and fracture zones
in the rocks overlaying the mine roof. If tests
13-00000

, >

show the area around a roof is weakening, it can be
supported by beams or roof bolts."

In seismic exploration, a high energy explosion
is set off, and sensitive instruments determine the
structure and makeup of surrounding land by record-
ing how fast the shock waves travel through the
ground. The waveforms can be interpreted to pin-
point probable deposits of oil, and to describe rock
formations. "Using a large energy souce like an ex-
plosion in a mine is out of the question," Dr. Podio
said, "so a manually controlled impact device was
designed to generate the shock waves." The impact
device, which works like a BB gun, uses air pressure
to shoot a round projectile at a striker plate
mounted at the end of the barrel.

When the striker plate is pressed against the
wall or roof of the mine and the device is triggered,
shock waves are sent through the surrounding rock.
Th ock waves are picked up by wideband transduc-
erS,;*digitized by a fast transient recorder, and
processed through the Nova 820 for waveform enhance-
ment. The waveform is then displayed on an oscil-
loscope, with the results of velocity and depth cal-
culations. Permanent records of the waveform can be
made on paper tape. or by transmitting the data to a
large scale remote computer. :

“A mine could make daily checks with the system
to detect changes in rock strata as the working face
of the mine advances," Dr. Podio said, “or the sys-
tem could be transported throughout the mine to make
daily checks on the condition of roofs at predeter-
mined key locations." Dr. Podio noted that similar
systems could be used to predict the quality of rock
in rapid excavation projects or could be used in
Nondestructive tests of large concrete structures.

PHONE BOOKS BY COMPUTER

Bell Telephone Laboratories
Mountain Ave.

Murray Hill, N.J. 07974

The Bell System is using computer technology to
modernize production of the White Pages telephone
books. A system designed to improve customer serv-
ice, control costs and streamline massive record-
keeping operations is now being implemented, The
system — called DIR/ECT (for DIRectory projECT) —
was developed by Bell Laboratories, the research
and development unit of the Bell System. Michigan
Bell Telephone Company recently issued its first
directory containing listings produced by the sys-
tem. Michigan Bell also is using the system to
Produce some of its directory assistance records.

BIR/ECT is a more sophisticated outgrowth of its
Prototype, PHOTAC, a similar process developed by
the New York Telephone Company under sponsorship of
the nationwide Bell System. The first directory
Produced by the PHOTAC system was distributed in
1966. Since then, New York Telephone has converted
some 4.5 million listings to the process. Currently
the 12 major downstate White Pages directories are
Produced by PHOTAC.

The DIR/ECT system stores in a computer memory
directory information such as the cudtomer's name,
address, telephone number — even telephone book
delivery instructions. The information in the com-
puter memory then is fed into a device called a
Photocomposer, which provides ready-to-print list-
ings for White Pages. Besides the annual White
Pages directories, DIR/ECT produces daily updates of

new listings and monthly reprints for the telephone
companies’ directory assistance operators.

Although customers may see no obvious differences
in the computer-produced directory, listings are
easier to read and pages cleaner looking. The di-
rectories also have uniform abbreviations, The sys-
tem has built-in cross-checks for consistent spell-
ing of street names and for obvious errors in street
and telephone numbers. There also is provision for
massive directory listing changes, caused by renam-
ing of streets and buildings.

Today, listings for phone directories are-gener-
ally set line-by-line in metal type. Changes in
listings must be reset and inserted by hand. With
the new system, changes can be made quickly (because
information is stored on magnetic computer tape and
not metal type), the need to store tons of lead type
will end, and the growing cost of publishing direc-
tories will be lessened.

M.LT, MUSIC PROJECT USES DEC COMPUTER

News Office .
Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Cambridge, Mass. 02139

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has be-
gun work on a project aimed at making the Institute
a major center for the study and composition of
electronic music. Barry Vercoe, assistant professor
of music, working with a computer given to the De-
partment of Humanities’ music section by Digital
Equipment Corp. of Maynard, is in the early stages
of developing a major electronic music production
facility at the Institute..

Professor Vercoe said the computer facility “will
be a tool both in the hands of the teacher and the
composer that will greatly aid the development of
creativity. The facility also will provide an ex-
cellent tool in the teaching of musical composition
for conventional instruments.

“This is definitely not a scientific project. I'm
not interested in merely getting a computer to sound
exactly like a trumpet. The technological applica-
tion, however, will interest some students who might
Not approach music otherwise and some of these will
be drawn into its aesthetic considerations, through
the back door as it were,” Professor Vercoe said.

Why compose music for a machine at all?

"I suppose someone asked that very question when
man first composed music for what are now traditional
instruments, instead of for the human voice alone,”
Professor Vercoe said. “Electronic music merely ex-
pands the forces available to the practicing com-
poser.”

. s

The POP-11/45 computer — coupled with music in-
put — also will lend itself to other forms of msic
research, such as syntactic analysis of music struc-
tures.

Professor Vercoe is the author of the widely used
Music 360 language for digital sound synthesis. He
has taught at M.I.T. for two years and is director
of the Experimental Music Studio. His work, "Meta-
morphoses for Orchestra," was given its Boston pre-
mier early this year by the M.I.T. Symphony and was
performed by the orchestra on its subsequent nation-
13-00000

wide'tour. Working with Professor Vercoe on the
project are Richard J. Steiger, a graduate student,
and Stephen Haflich, @ recent M.I.T. graduate.

CISMUS) will be doing just that — generating music
with computer equipment. A composer will sit at the
computer and write a musical composition using an
electronic keyboard.

The new system, which was expected to be operable
this fall, should be an easier method of modifying
and editing a musical piece. The normal hand opera-
tions of changing notations on a printed score or
splicing tapes of recorded music are “more time-
consuming and inaccurate" processes for correcting
@ composition, according to Gary White.

The computer composing process begins when the
composer inserts introductory instructions into a
teletype machine. On an electronic keyboard he then
begins to compose his piece. The computer records
all musical instructions which are transformed
through a digital-to-analog sound converter and
loudspeaker into sound. This immediate feedback
system enables the composer to hear what he is com-
posing simultaneously. The computer also allows. the
composer to automatically play back and edit what he
has written simply by striking another key.

The musician has now completed one “layer” of
music. If he wants to add further musical instruc-
tions to the composition, he repeats the entire pro-
cess again. All layers merge together to obtain the
product — a completed electronic composition.

The music instructions which the composer inserts
into the system are a special electronic music nota-
tion — a “computer language." The English words it
uses can be compared to musical notation found on a
conventional score — treble and bass clefs, notes,
rests, and the like.

Electronic music has been used in commercial re-
cordings, and as background music for television,
radio and film. The Towa State system will be so-
phisticated enough for use in serious compositional
study, the production of background music for vari-
ous media, and for the demonstration of sound prop-
erties,

The ISMUS presently being built is a protytype of
a full-scale model. If the “test-system" proves
satisfactory, "we will look for funding to build a
full-scale model," says White. The project is pres-
ently supported by a $1,170 grant from Western Elec-

_ren in this southeastern Idaho community.

tric and a National Science Foundation institutional
grant of $6,698. The prototype employs a mini~com-
puter that is owned by Iowa State.

The studio will be used as a teaching tool for
the ISU music program. Computer software, the pro-
grams (sequences of operations to be performed by
the computer) written for the system, will be devel-
oped so a composer can use the studio equipment
without having prior knowledge of computer program-
ming. Students will be able to learn basic acousti-
cal concepts and principles of electronic music syn-
thesis and to develop sensitivity to timbre with the
ISMUS. Also contributing to introductory computer
science courses, the system will be a novel example
of computer application in a non-scientific field.

STUDENT PROGRAMS COMPUTER
FOR REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION

Edward J. Canty
Digital Equipment Corp.
Maynard, Mass. 01754

Using programs developed by a local high school
student, School District 91 in Idaho Falls, has put
its newly-acquired. computer to work as a “super
tutor” in remedial studies for disadvantaged child-
Designed
to improve the arithmetic and language arts skills
of children in grades 2 through 6, the project was
introduced by director of curriculum Dr. Wallace
Manning with federal Title’ 1 aid during the dis-
trict's 1973 summer session for children largely
from rural farm families. According to John A.
Christensen, computer sciences coordinator, the
project proved so successful in its initial appli-
cation that it has been continued in the fall se-
mester,

The student programmer is Robert Huntsman, 18, @
June graduate of Idaho Falls‘ Skyline High School.
Using the district's PDP-11/20 timesharing computer
system installed last December by Digital Equipment
Corporation, Huntsman developed programs for arith-
metic and language drill to serve between 40 and 50
pupils on each of two teletypewriter terminals situ-
ated in local elementary schools. “

In a typical arithmetic routine, the computer
types a problem and waits for the pupil's response
— ten seconds if the problem is a memory exercise.
longer if it involves several columns for addition
or several digits for multiplication. If the stu-
dent's answer is correct, Huntsman's program directs
the terminal to ring a bel! in congratulation; if
incorrect, the computer supplies a hint on where the
mistake occurred and encourages him to try again.

Answers to English and social studies workbook
questions have been entered in the computer memory,
allowing students to do their homework at a terminal
and receive immediate response. The computer keeps
score of right and wrong answers to produce reports
for teacher guidance. Spelling-recognition exer-
cises are also in use and Huntsman has undertaken
development of an arithmetic program involving frac-
tions

"One of the computer's major advantages is its
ability to pay attention to individual! children.”
Christensen said. “Every child enrolled in the
regular summer session was able to get experience
at a terminal and benefit from these interactive
programs." He said high school laboratory assist-
ants will continue to write instructional programs
for elementary and junior high levels, expanding the
library begun by Huntsman. For future summer ses-
13-00000

‘sions, he added, the district hopes to make such
computer assistance available at a nearby rural ele-
mentary school attended by children of migrant farm
workers.

RESEARCH FRONTIER

“TALKING” BALLPOINT PEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Ronald |. Deutsch
Stanford Research Institute
Menlo Park, Calif. 94025

A prototype model of a simple, inexpensive "talk-
ing” ballpoint pen, under development at Stanford
Research Institute (SRI), could reduce massive pa-
perwork and delay in routine business transactions.
The pen is similar to an ordinary pen in size and
Shape except that it is wired to a computer system.

ye eomputer is programmed to receive signals gener-
ated instantaneously as a person hand-prints charac-
ters with the pen to record information.

“Such instantaneous and remote processing of data
might be invaluable to large businesses engaged in
daily consumer-oriented services, such as banks, in-
surance companies and utilities," says staff scien-
tist Dr. Hewitt D. Crane, the inventor. For exam-
ple, the pen could be used by a bank teller credit-
ing a savings or checking account. In this case,
according to Dr. Crane, the data would not have to
be retranscribed from a piece of paper by another
employee, or the paper itself put through expensive
automatic reading equipment. Thus, costs and de-
lays could be reduced in crediting accounts or es-
tablishing cash requirements.

In another case, a meter reader making his rounds
for a utility could use the pen in combination with
a cassette recorder. When he returned to his of-
fice, the cassette tape would be programmed into the
system, thus eliminating the need for manual re-
transcription of a day's worth of data.

In the present laboratory version, the pen is
hooked to an audio unit as well as a teleprinter,
So that as a person writes, the characters appear on
the teleprinter and are spoken by the audio unit.

SRI holds a patent on the pen and is currently
seeking financial support for further development,
Dr. Crane says. He estimates that the pen itself
might cost about $25 to $50. A central computer
unit would be extra but could serve many pens.

It’s the first lie detector that
can be used on a dead
man. It works on tapes and
other voice recordings

2

by George O’Toole

SESSION Tag

The rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either
at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.
—Plato: The Republic, Book Three

It's a little frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with
a high degree of reliability, whether or not you are lying. it's called the Psychological
Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect. a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs
no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.
It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape. sound track or phonograph
record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on
a dead man.

Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. | resolved to use
it to probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. | set about collecting every recording | could lay my hands on
of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon | had compiled the tape-
recorded testimony of twenty-two persons—eyewitnesses, Dallas poticemen, the
pathologist wno conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,
Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Ear! Warren.

| ran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in
turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?
Was Oswaid the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-
graphs which the Warren Commission never saw—do they support the Commission's
lone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?
Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture | expected. Not
all the details are there, but ! guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory
of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark
Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.

The PSE is not a crystai ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function
it performs well. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of its use as a tool
for historica! research. To understand what { did with the PSE, one should know some-
thing about the device itself.

| first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when | met two of
its inventors, Alian D. Bell, Jr, and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, both
former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form
acompany called Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. tt was a logical second
career for the two men. Both are experts in the technology of espionage. Either one
could pick the tock on your front door in less time than it takes you to find your
key. Colonel Bell wears a Black Belt in karate, is an accomplished swordsman and
small-arms expert, and has a dozen inventions to his credit, from anti-bugging devices
to a miniaturized microdot camera. Colonel McQuistan is one of the foremost polygraph
experts inthe U.S., aspecialistin radio and audio surveillance, and a qualified locksmith.

the things tns PSE was being used for,

atthe police in Howard County, Maryland,

ve had great success in establishing the

Bell went on to describe some of his
ention’s citer uses, actual or potential.

. ‘ktor and the Federal government are ex-
~~ yring its use as a defense against skyjack-

} and telephoned bomo threats, and as
neans of speeding up customs inspec-
ns. Some dectors and psychiatrists are
ing PSEs to study patients’ physica! and
intal stress. The National Committee to
testigate Aerial Phenomena, a private
dup tfiat investigates UFO reports, is
w using the PSE to interview witnesses
UFO sightings.

asked Bell if he would lend me a PSE
experiment with, in order to write a piece
out the device. He agreed, with two con-
ions. First, | must take Dektor's three-day
arse in cperating the instrument; second,
er using the PSE, | must review my
2rpretation of its output with his staff, in

interest of accuracy. This seemed rea-
able, so | agreed.

As the tape recorder reels siowly turn,

the moving chart paper, leaving benind a
ragged trail. Then the recorder is stopped,
the chart paper is stopped, and that's all
there is to it. The result is a strip of paper

human eye and brain.

On the afternoon of the first day, Kradz
showed us what to look for. The unstressed
voice looks like an untrimmed hedge, with
stalks of different heights sticking up (and
down) at irregular intervals. But add some
stress, and that hedge begins to look
trimmed. The greater the stress, the

smoother the shape. If the subject was
eaosriencing the hard stress which accom-
panies deception, the over-a!l outline of tie
figure tends to take on a rectangular shape,
a concertina as seen by the piayer. Kradz
showed slide after slide of chans made dur-
ing actual! police interrogations. He told us
the background of each case and pointed
out the tell-tale signs of deception, when-
ever they were present.

That night each student took a PSE back
to his room to practice operating it. Some
coordination must be learned to become
facile in handling the recorder and the PSE,
but clearly the difficult part of the course
would be learning how to read and interpret
the charts.

1 ran my first rea! interrogation tans.

The interrega ation always includes the
Question. “Are you afraid that | will ask you
about something we have not discussea?”
A negative answ2r with no sign of stress
eliminates the outsida-issue problem. Also,
the examiner always asks some innocuous
questions, such as, “Do you iike the color
blue?" in order to observe the subject's
general state of tension. And there is always
one “red-herring” question.

The red herring is used to identiiy the
“guilt complex responder." Such 2 person
shows stress when he responds to any
accusatory question. The examiner may
ask, “Did you steal the watch?" when it is
money, not a waich, that is missing. A
stressed denial will alert the examiner, who
carefully compares this response to the
stress produced by questions about the
missing money.

That night the class was given tapes of
real police interrogations. !n most cases,
Kradz was the examiner, and in every case,
he knew the background and resolution of
the matter. One case | was assigned con-
cerned a young man accused of stealing
money from his father's store. Kradz started
by asking the “outside-issue” question. No.
the young man replied, he was not afraid
Kradz would ask him a question they hadn't
discussed. Then the following exchange
took place:

“Do you tive in Howard County?”

“Yes.”

“Do you suspect someone of having taken
the money?”

“No.”

“Are you wearing a white shirt?”

“Yes.”

“Do you know who took the money?”

“No.”

“Are you wearing a ring?”

"Yes."

“Did you take the money?"

“No.”

There were a few red-herring questions
to check for the guilt complex response.
The questions about wearing a white shirt
and aring and living in Howard County had
been included to measure the background
stress elicited by irrelevant issues.

| selected a point in the interview at which
Mike Wallace suggested that Irving had not
interviewed Howard Hughes, but had hap-
pened on some transcripis of Hughes’ state-
ments. Irving asked how he could have hap-
pened on them. Wallace rejoined, “Where
did you happen on those transcripts?” Irv-
ing replied, ‘! got the transcripts from

on the PSE.

It was a perfect example of total stress,
horizontally blocked, with the smooth,
“trimmed-hedge” wave form. Clifford Irving
was a master liar. and he had beaten the
polygraph, but he wouid have been caught
by the PSE.

A few days after our first meeting,

turned up a few things for me. | visited him
at the Committee's office in downtown
Washington. He gave me a tape recording
and a typewritten transcript. The recording
was the Louis Lomax television program of
Sunday, October 16, 1966. Wesley Liebler,
a member of the Warren Commission's staff,
was the guest. The transcript was of a CBS
News television program entitled The War-
ren Report, which had been broadcast in

Most of the exchange between Liebler.
Lomax and the audience was argumenta-
tive and did not dea! with specific factual
points. | found two key statements dy Lied-
ler, though, and | charted them.

The first statement, in response to a ques-
tion by Lomax, was, “I have no doubt about
the conclusions of the [Warren] Resort.”
Plenty of stress was evident. but not much
more than in other statements.

The second statement related to those
Warren Commission documents which were
not included in the Report—they were
locked up in the National Archives. Lomax
asked Liebler if there was anything in the
documents which wouid alter Lieblier's
opinion. Taken literally, it was a strange
question, since Liebler had seen the docu-
ments and. if they would alter his opinion.
they would already have dcne so. Lomax
probably meant to ask if the decuments
would conflict with the conclusions of the
Warren Report. Whatever Liebler thought
the question meant, he answered quickly.
“Oh. none. none at all." The PSE showed
much more stress here than during any of
Liebler's other statements.

had been a number of rather unsavory
allegations in the press about Clay Snaw,
unrelated to the Garrison charges. Odom
may have felt extremely uncomfortable
about linking himself to this man in any way.
The coincidence of the box numbers
seemed very suspicious, but Bob Smith of
the Committee had pointed out to me that
both Shaw’s and Oswald's notebooks were
filled with numbers. so the chance of such
a coincidence was act that remote.

Shaw was comoleteiy innocent of complic-
ity in the assassinaticn. Tne lesson of this
episode is twofoid. First. stress in any one
person's testimony does not prove cecep-
tion. Second. given enough testimony by
different witnesses, the PSE can arrive at
the truth.

The first person | ran on the PSE who had
any direct knowledge of the assassination
was Oswald's widow, Marina. Unfortu-
nately, only one of her statements was on
the CBS tapes—that Oswald had owned a
rifle. The PSE said she was telling the truth.

The rifle had been one of the maior points
of controversy raised by critics of the War-
ren Report. The debate centered on two
points: whether the Mannilicher-Carcano
alleged to have belonged to Oswald was
the rifle found by the Dallas police in the
Texas Schoo! Book Depository, and whether
that particular gun could have been the mur-
der weapon.

On the tapes, Darrell C. Tomlinson. an
employee of Parkiand Hospital, testified
that he had found a rifle bullet on a stretcher
which he believed had carried Governor
Connally. Ther2 was no stress in his state-
meni. The PSE said he was telling the trutn.

Or. Joseph D. Nicol. Superintendent of
the Bureau of Criminal Investigation for the
State of Iitinois. ran batlistic tests on Suliet
fragments found in the presidentiai timou-
sine. and on the intact bullet found by Tom-
linson. Nicol testified that both the intact
bullet and the bullet fragments had been
tired by the Mannlicher-Carcano. He. too.
was apparently felling the truth.

Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman of
the Dallas police claimed that he found
Oswaid’s Mannticher-Carcano on the sixth
ficor of the Texas School Book Depositary.
However. on tne day of the assassination.
he had.to'd tiie press that the rifie he’ founa
was a German Mauser. The following day
he signed an affidavit to that effect. But on
the CBS tapes he testified that he had been
mistaken about that point, that it had really

sag notthe

vaid’s rifle. The PSE showed con-
siress in his statemenis.

n Gerald L. Hill testified that he
und thse spent oullet’hulls on the floor
aneati the window from which the fatal
1ots allegedly were fired. The PSE showed
rd stress in his statements.

The rific was one of the principal points
sod by the Warren Commission to link
swald to the assassination. The PSE sub-
antiated the testimony that Oswaid owned
rifle and that the evidence supplied to
ballistics expert indicated this rifle was
e@ murd2r weapon. However, the PSE did

ought Tippitt knew Oswald. “No,” he
plied, “I don't think he knew Oswald.” Did
ickson know Oswald? “No,” answered
ickson, “I didn't either.” The PSE showed
tavy stress in both statements.

Perhaps tne greatest source of con-
wersy over the Warren Report is it's claim
at all the shots were fired by one gunman.
ome eyewitnesses claim to have heard
tots anid Seen gunsmoke in the area of
low hillock ahead and to the right of the
‘esidential motorcade. This hillock has
‘me to be known as “the grassy knoll.”
ne of these witnesses was a railroad
orker named S.M. Holland, who observed

the scene from an overpass near the knoll.
The PSE confirmed that he thought he had
seen a puit of smoke on the knoll, but it
cculd not support his claim that he had
heard a shot from that direction.

Another witness, Charles Brehm, was
quoted by Mark Lane as having said that
he had seen a portion of the President's
skill flying hack over the left rear end of
the limousing. Lane offered this as evidence
of a shot from the grassy knol!, On the CBS
tapes, Brehm stated heatedly that he had
been quoted out of context, and emphatic-
ally denied that any shots had come from
the knoll. Despite his emotional state, there
was almost no stress in this statement.

Officer Jacks of the Dallas police, who
was riding in the fimousine of Vice-
President Johnson, denied that any of the
shots had come from the direction of the
grassy knoll. The PSE turned up a fair de-
gree of stress.

Three witnesses, Mrs. Caroline Walther,

with a shorter gun. Rowland told the Warren

Commission he had seen two men, one an
etderly Negro, in the window Oswald is
alleged to have fired from, but on the CBS
tapes he claimed he had seen an armed
man ata different window. The Commission
telied heavily on the testimony of Brennan,
who claimed to have seen a gunman in the
“Oswald window” actually firing the last of
the shots. The PSE showed hard stress in
the testimony of all three witnesses.

The PSE analysis of the eyewitnesses’

testimony regarding the source of the snots
is ambiguous. it supports Holland's claim
to have seen a puff of smoke on the knoll,
and Brehm's denial that any shots came
from that direction, and it raises serious
doubts about all other claims and counter-
claims, This contradiction seems to result
from the notorious unreliability of eyewit-
nesses, perhaps compounded by a fair
amount of fabrication. Deception, if it is
present here, may have been motivated
merely by a desire for attention. Or there
may have been darker reasons.
. There is, however, other evidence and
testimony that could shed some light on the
existence, number and location of assas-
sins other than Oswald. This brings us to
perhaps the most dubious and controversia!
element in the Warren Commission's ver-
sion of the event—the autopsy.

Within minutes after the shooting. Ken-
nedy had been rushed to the emergency
room at Parkland Hospital, where Dr. Mal-
colm Perry tried to save his life. The physi-
cian saw that the President had suffered
a massive head wound and asmallerwound
in the throat. Perry performed a tracheos-
tomy, cutting through the throat wound in
an attemnt ta open a breathing passage.
Afterward, when hope for the President had
been abandoned, Perry met with the press
and declared that the wound in tne front
of the neck had been an entry wound.

The President's body was fiown to
Washington, D.C. There. approximatety
eight hours after the shooting, an autopsy
was parformed at Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Because of the tracheostomy, the rature of
the neck wound could no longer be ob-
served and was, at first, overlooked. Later,
after consulting the Dallas doctors, the
Bethesda pathologists concluded that it
was an exit wound. The autopsy report
stated that there were two entry wounds,
one fow in the rear scalp and one at the
right base of the neck; and two exit wounds.
the throat wound and a large irregular
wound on tne right side of the head.

The confusion was compounded when
two FBI agents present at the autopsy
reported that a wound had been found in
the President's back, and that no corre-
sponding exit wound had been Jocated.
Diagrams made during the autopsy seemed
to confirm this, showing the lower of the
two entry wounds to be below the shoulders,
not at the base of the neck. What became
of the bullet? The agents reported that
Bethesda doctors thought the bullet had
dropped from the wound when the Dallas
doctors attempied external heart massage.
But this was the shot that the Commission
claimed had passed through Kennedy and
struck Governor Connally.

X-rays and color photographs of the au-
topsy were made. The brain was removed
from the body. Brain and skin tissue slides
were orepared for microscopic examina-
tion. Remarkably, the Warren Commission
never asked to see any of this evidence.
relying instead solely on the testimony of
Captain James J. Humes, one of the
pathologists who conducted the autopsy.
Even more incredible is the disappearance
of the brain, the slides. and some of the
photographs, which were alleged to have
been turned over to the National Archives
by the Bethesda Naval Hospital. -

Both Dr. Perry and Captain Humes were
interviewed on the CBS tapes. Perry was
asked about the throat wound he'd seen
when the President was brought to Parkland
Hospital. His answer seemed evasive. He
neither confirmed nor denied that he had
thought it was an entry wound, talking in-
stead about the difficulty of making such
a determination and the fact that his atten-
tion had been devoted to saving the Presi-
dent's life. Then the interviewer asked him
directly whether he had thought at the time
thatitwas an entry wound. “Actually, | didn't

by others.

which was part of a series called The Bran-
deis Television Recollections. Bob Smith of
the Committee provided me with the tape.

The interview was an hour long, but the
Kennedy assassination and tne Warren
Commission came up only once. The inter-
viewer, Abram Sachar, Chancellor of Bran-
deis University, was friendly and deferen-
tial. | charted some of Warren's remarks
unrelated to the assassination and found
that he was generaily unstressed, Sachar
raised the subject of the Commission
obiiquely, and Warren volunteered several
rather iengthy statements about it

Warren said that immediately after the as-
sassination there weve iwo thecries, one that
Khrushchev and Castro were behind the
kiiling. the other that a group of right-wing
Texas oilmen were responsible. He said:

“We expi!cred both of those theories for
ten months and found no evidence that
either of them was involved in it.”

Tne PSE showed hard stress.

He continued:

. we found no evidence of any kind

that there was any conspiracy.”

Again there was stress, and particutariy
hard stress on the words “no evidence.”

“| have read everything.” said Justice
Warren, “that has come to my notice in the

far as the private resources of a free-lance
writer permit.

What. given the sample of testimony !
have processed with the PSE, can | say
about the assassination?

We should first examine the testimony in
which no stress was found, since itis almost
certain that these people were telling the
truth as they saw it. This strongly suggests
the following:

1. Oswald owned a rifle.

2. A bullet fired from that rifle was found
on Governor Connaily's stretcher at Park-
land Hospital.

3. Bullet iragments alleged to have been
found in the presidential limousine atso
came from Oswald’ s rifle.

4. Al least one eyewitness believes he
saw gunsmoke on the grassy knoll, but
another is equally certain no shots came
from that direction.

5. Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippitt.

6. At least one member of the Warren
Commission and one memiber of the Com-
mission's staff really believe in tne = validity
of the Warren Report.

7. Jim Garrison had little or no case
against Clay Shaw.

Almost ail of this tends to support. in oné
way Or another, the Warren Report. But now

gs Louk, at the lestimony that is called into
‘estion by the PSE:
1 The claim that Oswald's sifle was
ind inthe Texas School Book Depository.
2, The claim that bullet hulls matching
wald's rifle were found in the same place
3. The claim that one gunman was secn
ie “Oswaid window" of the Dalias Book
pository.
4. The claim that two gunmen were seen
this window.
3. The claim that a gunman was seen
a different wincow of that building.
5. Another claim thatno shots came from
grassy knoil, and a claim by the witness
o saw the gunsmoke on the knolt that
also hearc a shot from that direction.
7, Aclaim by a Dailas policeman that
ither he nor Oficer Tippitt knew Oswald.
.3. The claim cy the pathologist—the
aren : 7's only source of infor-
tion about the autopsy—that the X-rays
d autopsy > raphs support his tes-
tony before ommission.
2. The claim cy a member of the Warren
mmission tha: there was nothing fraudu-
» ft about the n Report.
10, The ciaim by Eari Warren that the
mmission found no evidence of a con-
iracy; that none of the Warren Report's
tics ever found anything the Commission
dmissed; tr nad found nothing since
* publication of the Report to change his
w. and that re knew of no Commission
¢mber.who had ever changed his mind
ut their conciusions.

\f we accept that each instance of stress
indicates deception, an interesting and
unexpected possibility emerges:

Oswald was involved in some way in the
assassination, if only as a fall guy. Soma of
the Dallas police force may have been in-
volved, planted the evidence that impli-
cated Oswald, and covered up the fact that
there was a conspiracy. The medical exam-
iner believed his own testimony to the War-
ren Commission, bui later had doubts. The
Commission found evidence of a conspir-
acy but didn't believe it. so they covered
it up in order to present a tidy package to
the public. Later, at least one member of
the Commission changed his mind, but
since he didn't know what really did hap-
pen, he decided to say nothing. So there
was conspiracy in Dallas, and in Washing-
ton nothing worse than blundering.

nel
nS

{ could say ali this with certainty if | knew
that stress always equais deception. Unfor-
tunately, | do not know that. But the PSE
analysis of the assassination tapes has
generated a staggering amount of fresh
doubt regarding the Warren Report. This
doubt rises not only from specific points
the PSE has called into question, but from
the very sinister implications of the very
existence of deception among policemen,
government officials and Commission
members. The question remains: did such
deception exist or was the stress found by
the PSE the result, in every case, of an out-
side issue?

Obviously, whenever stress is found by
the PSE and cannot be cross-checked by
a structured interrogation, some probability
must be accefted that this stress is caused
by an outside issue. No study has yet been
conducted to es:ablish wnat this probability
might be, but let us pick. for the sake of
discussion, a figure ihat may seem ridicu-
lously high—70 percent. In other words, we
are assuming that 70 percent of the times
the PSE finds stress in testimony, it results
from something other than lying.

’ Now, let's ignore the deception indicated
in the testimony of the eyewitnesses: even
if present, it might have resulted from mere
desire for attention. That leaves eight “in-
siders" who have demonstraied stress when
making statements supporting the Warren
Report: the Dallas policemen Hill, Jacks,
Jackson and Weitzman; the medical exam-
iner, Captain Humes; Commission staffer
Wesley Liebler; Commission member John
McCloy: former Chief Justice Earl Warren.

Assuming that there is a 70 percent
chance that any sing/e instance of stress
is “outside issue," what is the probability
that all eight instances are due to factors
other than deception? Elementary proba-
bility theory tells us.tnat it is seven-tenths
raised to the eighth power, or approximately
6 percent.

tn other words, even making some fairly
conservative assumptions. there is a 94 per-
cent chance that at least one of these eight
men is lying. :

My own personal opinion? | don't know.
| remember the young man with the ring.
He said he was wearing it, and he was.

‘but he stressed. He stressed not because

he was lying, but because there was some-
thing about that ring that really bothered
him, something he didn’t want the world to
know. Perhaps that is also true of thes2 men
who, in one way or another, learned some
part of the truth about the assassination of
John F. Kennedy.

| suppose I'm not absolutely sure even
of that. When | first met Bob Smith of the
Committee, | asked him if there was any
one thing the government could do to clear
up the mystery. Yes, he replied, the one
thing that would help more than anything
else would be to make available the physi-
cal evidence — the detailed FB! lab re-
Ports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs.
the microscopic slides, the bloodstained
clothing, yes, even the President's brain,
wherever it has been hidden. These things.
he said, would go far toward answering the
questions about what actually happened
that day in Dallas. Maybe they would even
confirm the Warren Report.

So when | say I'm not absolutely certain
these men are concealing something, |
mean | can think of something that could
conceivably change my mind. Thatis. ifthe
government would open ail its files on this
matter to us and prove that we are wrong
—we, the peopie who ten years later still
believe we haven't yet heard the full account
of the events of November 22, 1963.

Federal Bureau of Investigation
Attention; Mr. S.J. Papich

SUBJECT : Investigation in Japan of Report on ssepifieaal
Actions of Gerald Lee Richards, Originally
Described as Resembling Suspected Assassin of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

1, Reference is made to the report concerning the above
subject made by telephone to Mr. S.J. Papich at 0930 on 17 April
1968, Following is a full account of the investigation made in ¢
this case:

ee A. On 16 April 1968 a United States National
/I0- Maritime Union official in Yokohama reported that one
Gerald Lee-Richards, who bore a general physical
ra ‘yesemblance to the description given of the suspected
gp assassin of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had arrived
“ in Japan about 15 April 1968 and requested a position
aboard any ship going anywhere. Richards became
agitated when asked for a contact address in Japan
and refused to divulge his Japanese residence, The
National Maritime Union official describd. Richards <
as 5? 10" tall, 155 pounds, with brown hair, a receding ~ -
hairline on both sides, and a not very prominent scar
two and one-half inches long traversing the center
forehead, his most outstanding characteristic being a
_ Gisconcerting, idiotic grin resembling a constant -
grimace, According to Richards' documents and state- *.«
ments, he was born _8-:April 1937, applied for seaman's
papers in San Pedro, California, 16 June 1964 and_ »’.
registered there as a United States National Maritime’ .:
Union member on 21 February 1968 but never shipped OULye,
- His Social Security Number is 562-46-5078; _his United “
States Coast Guard Number Z 2711-782,

Gee)

B, A subsequent check with the Japanese National
Police Agency confirmed the biographic data supplied
by the National Maritime Union official. A ward check.
indicated that Richards originally resided in Japan
from 1963 to 1964 and married TAKAYAMA Michiko in 1963,
Both Richards and his wife left Japan for the United
States in 1964. Richards returned alone to Japan about
15 April 1968, His wife's address in the United States
is listed as 160 Hosoi (phonetic) Street, Carpenteria,
California, 93013,

Cc, A photograph of Richards obtained from the
Japanese police was. shown to the National Maritime
Union official and identified by him as the individual
in subparagraph 1A above who had applied for a seaman's
berth, The photograph of Richards bears no apparent
resemblance to photographs of suspected assassin
James Earl Ray provided by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation,
