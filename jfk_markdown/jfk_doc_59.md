introduction

1. AMCLOCK/1 arrived in New York on 19 September 1967. He
had been given instructions to call a JMWAVE operational number
(iden A) jnext time he was out in a friendly country in order to receive ,
GOWTHEE instructions. When he failed to call soon after his arrival - gf
it was decided to try to establish visual contact with him at arpaste (hbg
same as was done successfully in 1966, to move him to call for contact i"
instructions. For that purpose D1 GERVENO_wag taken to HTBASTE on 7
21 September carrying a match folder from(iden Bwwith his alias, (iden C,
and room number. The plan was to make sure AMCLOCK/1 recognized
DI GERVENG, who also met him in 1966, and to pass the match folder pil
to AMGDCK/1 only if this could be done securely. DI GERVENO was et
able to make definite viaual contact on four different occastons: Coke

3. On 26 September AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1500 to 1830
i at Qdden B; AMCLOCK/1 appeared to be in good health and rested and in
} high spirits. He was very glad to see LI GERVENO again and to be able
to discuss things openly. He criticized bitterly the living conditions
in PBRUMEN but does not seem to be affected by it or by the fact that
he had to live under a regime he obviously hates. In fact, he seemed
quite sure of himself and plans to return to PBRUMEN at the end of the
HTBASTE session. He is scheduled to remain in New York until December
1967 but may return to PBRUMEN before then for a short visit to look
after his ailing mother and his wife, who had a baby girl two weeks
prior to his departure. This may have influenced AMCLOCK/1 not to
think about a possible defection at this time, which came as a surprise
to the case officer who expected the agent to have second thoughts
about return to PBRUMEN where he is not happy.

¥

4. AMCLOCK/1 explained that he could not make contact as instructed

hecause he had destroyed the phone number and both accommodation

addresses we had given him for him to report from inside PBRUMEN. He

destroyed them in the toilet at the airport upon his arrival in PBRUMEN

in late December 1966 after observing a number of uniformed individuals

at the airport which he considered to be suspicious, although they had

nothing to do with AMCLOCK/1. This may have been a convenient excuse for

his failure to make contact as instructed but DI GERVENO did not press

the issue. Instead he was given the operational numbers of the Beekman

site and of the Base in New York (Eden BPs and told he could always call yg.

ei there if he could not locate DI GE YO at (iden By He was also given eg
nee the JMWAVE number for emergency contact. K/1l said he tried to 2

make contact by callin den J J>to inguire about MIDDAUGH in true name,
Seg ee te ing Gee was SS told that MIDDAUGH was in Washington and

was given a phone number for him to call direct. AMCLOCK/1 was planning

ire oe call Washington at a later day if he had not been contacted.

5. AMCLOCK/1 reported that he has had no security problems and
has not been molested inside of PBRUMEN. He was treated "royally" by
the AMTHUG regime in early 1967 and everybody seemed pleased to see
him back. Apparently his return surprised some individuals who pri-
vately thought he would defect rather than return to PBRUMEN to live.
During this time he enjoyed special privileges and received frequent
invitations to official functions with foreign diplomats. However,
by mid 1967 the special privileges and invitations were gradually
suspended for no apparent reason. (For example, he was no longer

k allowed to take his private car to a government garage for repairs
and he had to arrange for themaintenance of his house, which was given
to nim and kept up by the government at first). AMCLOCK/1 believes
that this was due to his being under "observation" while going through
a reorientation period after his long stay abroad. There is nothing
to indicate that AMCLOCK/1 is not trusted or accepted by other govern-
ment officials. The fact that he was sent out again. is: REP trong

indication that he enjo,;s a favorable position in the AMTHUG regime.
He hopes that in 1968 he will be asgic¢ned to another permanent post
abroad.

6. In reference to his w.fe AMCLOCK/1 stated that he is now
convinced that she is totally against the AMTHUG regime. After
their marriage in late 1966 he was not sure of her true political
ideology but during the past year he has been able to confirm her
disagreement on a number of occasions. He feels confident that she
would follow him in any movement against the regime, such as defection,
but has not told her gbout his work for WOFACT. Gemsate KIAE Diaz. fose

Operational Chronology

1. On 27 September 1967 AMCLOCK/1 met DI GERVENO from 1130 to
1530 for lunch.at the Beekman site. The agent was not seen entering
or leaving the site and he stayed out of sight when food was brought
up from the restaurant downstairs. The meeting was conducted under
secure conditions and without interruptions. Only AMCLOCK/1 and

DI GERVENO t t. Deere
BNO were present at the megiDy: Coceaiwal (e/- WORUY

beset ca Naor ANCTOSKA eported that he had been assigned to work in
Gen By with den BY same as last year. A few days be his departure
from pesouen, Cen 2 told AMCLOCK/1 to watch out tor den i who is a
_-Wember of the intelligence service and will be reporting ‘on JAMCLOCK/1.
Lue Kee The implication was that AMCLOCK/1 was still under observation by the
AMTHUG regime and (iden _< C-actually told him to bend backwards in every
way possible to prove himself while in New York. AMCLOCK/1 explained
that this meant to live a model life while abroad and to perform extra
work | whenever required, without complaining. AMCLOCK/1 believes that
(iden “B is being trained to take over AMCLOCK/1's position as an expert
TNH-économics for the AMTHUG regime. teh this is the case, this may be
the last time AMCLOCK/1 is sent toUden A> Still, under much probing,
AMCLOCK/1 could not come out with any Clear indication that he was
suspected or was falling out of ‘grace with the AMTHUG regime. Although
the agent has a tendency to emphasize his "delicate" position, the
case officer believes that he is not mistrusted and still enjoys a
favorable position in the government, although probably considered too
bourgeois to be completely integrated with their communist philosophy.
3. Regarding the recent changes made in PBRUMEN diplomatic
¢, AMCLOCK/1 was not aware of any security shake up
, the Foreign Ministry. He regarded these changes
tter in accordance with their policy to bring back
a reorientation tour all those diplomats stationed
mree consecutive years or more. AMCLOCK/1 actually

appeared not to be aware of any major purge and not to be concerned
about it. However, if this is ‘true the chances for AMCLOCK/1 to be
reassigned abroad in the near future appear doubtful at this time.

4. When DI GERVENO asked AMCLOCK/1 about his work and how the
recent changes may affect him, the agent then reported the following
information about his position in the Foreign Ministry. After his
return in late December 1966 he was given four months vacation, during
which time he went by the ministry from time to time but had no job
assigned to him. He used most of this time for a honeymoon and to
relocate in his new home furnished by the PBRUMEN government. In the
SRE of 1967 (iden Coconsidered him actively as a substitute for
, siden Dowhom Gden does not like..However, the job did not materialize

because Iden CTs ~plans to send Gden BD as Ambassador to Canada were not

OS he “accepted py den > whon Eden Cowas going to send as Ambassador to
ye 5 Swit land. At that\ time CLOCK/1 was also considered for a position
fant gh in @den Fowhich was the position the PBRUMEN President wanted him to /§
OtGE High! take But AMCLOCK/1] avoided the position although it implied frequent Af :
. cal ravels abroad. The reason AMCLOCK/1 gave for not taking the position wé
a fe at Gden PF was that he @id not want to break away from his diplomatic,
career and felt he would be better protected among his friends in the?

i ~ Foreign Ministry. Consequently, after his vacation AMCLOCK/1 want
