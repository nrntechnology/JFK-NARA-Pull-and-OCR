WERE KILLED BY THE CIVIL GUARD.” EACH OF THESE SEPARATE ACTS HAS ©

SERVED TO WEAKEN THE MoT VATION OF DIFFERENT SEGMENTS - OF VIETNAMESE
AND TO. FURTHER NARROW , POSSIBLY TO A FATAL DEGREE, THE BASE OF

SUPPORT FOR THE REGIME.
2. “CONSUL GENERAL PHUONG FEARED THAT TUYEN'S DISMISSAL IN
PARTICULAR WOULD CAUSE CONSIDERABLE INSECURITY AMONG LOYAL SUPPORTERS
AND PUBL IC SERVANTS OF ‘THE REGIME WHO KNOW DR. TUYEN'S RECORD OF
LOYAL SERVICE To THE PRESIDENT AND ESPECIALLY TO HIS BROTHER, PRESI-
DENTIAL, COUNSELOR NGO DINH NHU. THESE OFFICIALS CAN CERTAINLY
QUESTION WHETHER ANYONE 'S POSITION IN THE’ REGIME IS SAFE IF TUYEN
couLD FALL FROM FAVOR. PHUONG STATED THAT SEVERAL FRIENDS OF HIS
WITH LONG : RECORDS OF SERVICE TO THE’ GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GYN)
AND To THE “PRESIDENTIAL FAMILY. HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN TO HIM DESPONDENT-
Ly ALONG THESE LINES. TUYEN HAD A BAD REPUTATION WITH MANY
OFFICERS IN THE VIETNAMESE ARMY AND BUREAUCRACY AS THE HATCHETMAN
AND TROUBLESHOOTER FOR NGO DINH NHU BUT NO ONE ‘DOUBTED HLS
- DEVOTION TO NHU, YET NHU HAS STRIPPED HIM OF ALL REAL AUTHORITY
“SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE OF A SILLY WOMEN 'S TIFF BETWEEN’ |...
MADAME NHU AND MADAME TUYEN. ANY OBJECTIVE GVN OFFICIAL MIGHT
_ QUEST ON THE FRIVOLITY, INGRATITUDE AND LACK OF PERSPECTIVE OF A REGIME
THAT ACTS THUS.

INTELLECTUALS PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM NORTH VIETNAM. THOSE WHO |

DID NOT LIKE HIM AT LEAST TRUSTED. HIS FAIRNESS | AND BASIC EMPATHY
: WHEREAS THEY NEITHER TRUSTED NOR LIKED NHU EVEN THOUGH’ NHU HIMSELF

WAS AN INTELLECTUAL.
4, WITHIN THE: CAN LAO PARTY, WHICH tS STILL ONE OF THE SECRET

"MAINSPRINGS OF SUPPORT. IN VIETNAM FOR, THE PRESIDENT AND THE NGO
FAMILY, THE PARALLEL REMOVAL FROM AUTHORITY OF .HUYNH VAN LANG HAS
OccAS 1ONED SIMILAR DOUBTS AMONG THE PARTY'S RANK ~AND-FILE. ‘AS IN
TUYEN'S CASE, CAN LAO MEMBERS CAN QUESTION. WHAT VALUE IS LOYALTY .

AND SERVICE IF A MAN LIKE LANG CAN LOSE HIS. POST.

5. THE EVEN MORE SERIOUS: MISTAKE WHICH MAY NARROW THE BASE OF
SUPPORT: FOR THE GVN TO A FATAL DEGREE WAS THE SHOOTING OF BUDDHIST
PARADERS AT -HUE ON ‘THE: OCCASION OF BUDDHA'S BIRTHDAY. .THE HUE
REGIME OF CENTRAL VIETNAM COUNSELOR NGO DINH CAN HAS ALWAYS OPERATED
LIKE AN AUTONOMOUS POLICE STATE “AND HAS BEEN NOT@RIOUS FOR ITS:
FAVORITISM TOWARD CATHOLICS;. BELYING PRESIDENT -DIEM'S
‘EARLIER REPUTATION FOR. RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE. MANY V LETNAMESE
CATHOLICS FEAR THAT THE GVN‘S INCREAS ING PRO-CATHOLIC BENT WILL BE
HARMFUL TO.THE CHURCH.AS WELL AS TO. THE REGIME. CERTAINLY THE
STUPID SUPPRESSION OF BUDDHIST RELIGIOUS FLAGS AT HUE ON 8 MAY (ON

BUDDHIST VIETNAM AGAINST. BOTH THE REGIME AND THE CATHOLICS. —
. 6. FROM REPORTS REACHING HIM PHUONG FOUND IT PARTICULARLY
SIGNIFICANT THAT WHEN CENTRAL VIETNAM AUTHORITIES: ORDERED POLICE

TO EXECUTE THE DIRECTIVE BANNING FLAGS, INITIALY THE POLICE “MERELY
RESTATED THE ORDER BUT WOULD NOT RIP DOWN ANY BUDDHIST FLAGS.

FINALLY SEVERAL CATHOLIC POLICE DID SO, BUT SOME BUDDHIST POLICE-

MEN REFUSED, SAYING THAT BUDDHIST FLAGS SHOULD BE PERMITTED JUST

AS CATHOLIC FLAGS ARE FLOWN ON SAINTS DAYS. SUCH DEFIANCE OF ‘ORDERS *
AT HUE 1S QUITE RARE, PHUONG SAID.

7. ‘THE CROWNING INSULT TO BUDDHISTS WHICH WILL FURTHER ENFLAME THEM
AND ALSO REVIVE THE OUTCRY AGAINST NGO FAMILY RULE WAS |
THE NEWS OF HUE ARCHBISHOP NGO DINH THUC'S PLAN THAT THE PRESIDENT

ASK BUDDHIST ASSOCIATIONS ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM TO CONDEMN THE
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND DISORDER OF THE HUE BUDDHISTS. ARCHBISHOP
THUC REPORTEDLY WENT TO:SAIGON TO DEMAND. THIS. THE VC COULD’ NOT
HAVE A BETTER PROPAGANDA WEAPON IF THEY HAD LAUNCHED THE IN-
CIDENT AND DIRECTED .THUC'S REACTION, THEMSELVES.

8. BY SUCH ACTS THE REGIME IS DESTROYING CONFIDENCE AND LOYAL
MOTIVATION OF PUBLIC SERVANTS, INTELLECTUALS, PARTY SUPPORTERS, AND
THE MASS OF NON-CATHOLIC PEASANTRY IN ITS MOST CRUCIAL TIME.
