, The April 9, 1963, issue of the "Miami News"
carried an article entitled, "Exiles Say Miro.To Quit",
This article stated that informed exile sources claim
that Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA would rezizn his post as head
of the Cuban Revolutionary Council. Tne article said
exile sources gave two possibllities for his resignation.
One faction believed that MIRO's recent trip to Washington
from which he returned Sunday (April.7) was to pin down the
United States Government to a Statement of positive policy
regarding Cuba. Another school of thought was that the
Council head was retiring from hia poet in protest of:
Governnent curbing of hit-and-run raids on the Comaunist
island of Cuba.

The article went on to state that Dr. MIRO's
leadership in the Council, aimed at uniting all Cuban
exiles, nas been burdened by protlems since his appointment

in March 1961,

On April 10, 1963, MM T-1, a former Cuban
business executive, who is employed ‘hy the Cuban Revolutionary
Council and who is a close bersonal friend of Dr. MIRO CARDONA,
who has furnizhed some reliable information in the past,
advised that an all-night sesaion of the Council was held
beginning April 9, and ending at about 6:00 A.M., on
April 10, during which time MIRO CARDONA presented his
resignation but the Council refused to accept his resignation
and MIRO CARDONA was persuaded to remain as President of the

Council.

MM T-1 said that MIRO's resignation consisted of
a 25-page statement which was in effect an indictment against
the administration of President JOi F, KENNEDY of the United
States. In rejecting his resignation, the Council backed up

MK T-1 explained that when Dr, MIRO CARDONA returned
to Miami from a trip to Washington, D. C., on Sunday, where he
contacted high government officials, he came away with the

feeling that:

1) The United States nas no plan to free Cuba
of Communism.

2) If the United States ever does formulate any
plans, 1t will do so without consideration
for the Cuban exiles in the United States.

3) The United States policy 1s now one of
peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba.

MM T-1 said that in his opinion, the Cuban exiles
are frustrated, confused, losing faith in the United States
and there is a growing feeling of abandonment of them by the

United States.

The April 10, 1963, issue of the "Miami Herald"
earried a headline article entitled, “Miro Resigns as Exile
Chief; Raps U. S. Policy". This article stated that MIRO
CARDONA resigned because the United States refused to allocate
fifty million dollars to train a Cuban invasion force, according

close to HIRO said he resigned not only because of disagree-
ment witn United States policy, “but because he feels
Waeningcon dves not have any concrete plans to deal with

the dictator”,

The April 11, 1963, 1asue of the "Miami Herald"
carsied an article entitled, "Cuban Extle Council Vows to
Continue the Freedom Fight", In this article it was
Btated that the Cuban Revolutionary Council had vowed to
continue ite fight against Castro-Communism whether the
United 3tates likes it or not. The article said that Dr.
MIRD CAZLONA denied reports from U. S. Government sources
that he offered his resignation to the Council because the
United Zcates refused to allocate fifty million dollars to
train a Cuban invasion force. The article stated thet an
informed gource said that MIRO decided to quit "because
of the change in the U. S. - Cuban poltoy™.

Tne April 16, 1963, issue of the "Miami Herald”
carried an article entitled "JFK Accepts Demand, Fidel Says",
This article by the UPI bearing a Havana dateline reported
that PIcZL CASTRO told Cubans on Thursday (April 11) that the
KENUEDY Administration has accepted one of his five demands
for an er4 to tension in the Caribbean. ‘This article stated
that in a one hour and forty minute speech, CASTRO said that
Washington in forbidding exiles to carry on further armed
attacxa on Cuba, has fulfilled one-off "five points for peace"

then went on to state that FIDZL announced that there are
Still fcir conditions to be fulfilled and that acceptance of

On April 15, 1963, MM T-1 advised that he was
positive that MIRO CARDONA did not intend to again tender
his resignation on Monday, April 15, 1962, but was
contemplating taking that action on the following Thursday,
April 18, 1963. MM T-1 said that the Council was meeting “~....
on Thureday to take a ‘definite attitude ortough line of ee
action and that it waa entirely probable that all of the
members of the Council might resich in protest to the present
policy of the United Ztates with regard to the Cuban situation.
He said that the prezent feeling of the Council towards the
United States is tasically “to hell with it".

MM T-1 expreased the personal feeling that U. 3S,
policy towards Cuba 18 presentlyin a vacuum and consequently
everything 18 at a standstill. Ine Cuban exiles in the
Miami area feel that the U. S. is abandoning their cause
and has now adopted a course of peaceful cc-existence with

Communist Cuba.

On April 16, 1963, MM T-2, a Cuban exile who has .
furnished some reliable information in the past and who is we
associated with fellow Cubans who belong to several different
organizations, ddvieed that reaction among the Cuban exiles
is “very bad against the United States". He explained that the
Cuban exiles allege that President KENNEDY nas made promises
to help them in their fight against CASTRO but i8 now opposing
them and consequently they feel that the U. 8. 18 now committed
to a policy of peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba. :

“ The Cuban exiles are fearful as to the future, confused as to
why the U. S. has changed ite policy and the exiles feel that
they have been abandoned in their fight.
