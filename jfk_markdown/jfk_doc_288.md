MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: The Wackenhut Corporation
3280 Ponce de Leon Boulevard
Coral Gables, Florida

1. Mr. Bannerman, Security Office, arranged through Chief,
CCS for the writer to meet Mr. Geor, jWackenhut, President of
subject, to explore its potential for cover| support. At 10:30
a.m., on 14 March 1963, Mr. Wackenhut, Mr. Wes Reynolds, and I
met at Mr. Reynold's home, 3809 37th Street, Horth, Arlington. -

~My. Reynolds epparently represents Wackenhut in the Washington

area, although I did not gather that the firm is. actually
operating here at present. Mr. Wackenhut end Mr. Reynolds, both,
ere ex-FBI agents.

2. Wackenhut started his firm in 1954. In 1961 it was
reported to have 1100 employees and anticipated 196] sales in
excess of $5 million. At present it has offices in Miami,

Coral Gables, Tampa, Jacksonville, Philedeiphia, New York. City,
Boston, Buffalo, Denver, Los Angeles, San Jose (calir. ), Honolulu,
Sen Juan and Ponce, Puerto Rico. Wackenhut freely states that _
he trades on the reputation of the FBI by publicizing widely the
21 ex-FEI agents, including two former Assistant Directors of the

3. The Operating Divisions of the company and their services
are described in e Wackenhut brochure as follows:

Investigative Division .

Performs all types of investigations for attorneys, insurance
companies, benks and other businesses; sets up internal audit
systems to prevent embezzlements, and investigates personel back-
grounds of prospective executives, business partners and associates.

Scientifie Services Division

Conducts pre and post-employment, pre=-promotional and 1 gpect-
fie lie detector examinations for business and industry; spectel-
izes in technical security and investigetive techniques, scientific
detection devices, and electronic and mechanical security methods
and equipment, and performs electronic "sweeps" to counter business
esplonage through the detection of electronic intrusion attempts.
1400000, .

Internal Intelligence Division
Specializes in exposing and controlling inside thefts that may

renge from employee pilferage, through embezzlement of thousands of
dollars, to highly valusble industrial secrets.

Central Clearing Division

Assists personnel end security directors to sereen quickly
the backgrounds of present end potential employees through the
messive files of The Wackenhut ‘Yorporation.

Retail Store Protection Division

Increases net profits by reducing inventory shortages through
the control of internel end externel losses with security programs
designed to meet the client's specific needs.

tr: Services Division -

Provides specialized training programs for security, fire
fighting, investigative and other personnel of business organiza~
tions and professional groups.

Industrial Security Division

Provides the essential security services that are required by
all companies seeking or handling government classified contracts;
assists management in disaster and emergency planning.

Fire and Safety Division
Supplies ambulance services, first eid erews, Waekenhut fire-

men fully trained in the technical field of industrial and mni-
 Gipal fire fighting ‘and equipment, and safety surveys, systems,

and educational programs.
" Quard Forces Division

Selects, investigates, trains and supervises the uniformed

and plein-clothes guards who protect your operations; also provides

uniformed receptionists and guardettes; makes physical property

surveys to determine security requirements and. establishes security

systems and controls.

4. Mp. Wackenhut wants to expand abroad, in view of his
successful venture into Puerto Rico. However, he has no definite
plans as of the present and seemed to be seeking Grom CIA covert xt
sponsorship] for entry into areas of interest to us. He is pre-
pared to furnish personnel himself /or to permit integration of 2y
Agency nominees.{

5- It is not epparent to me that there is any significant
market for Wackenhut's services in foreign countries, except
possibly among American businesses with physical plants overseas.
The nature of these services, I would presume, would make rather .
difficult acquisition of the necessary occupational permits in
many countries. The potential for clandestine intelligence acti-
vities would be too apvious to host governments, and the emphasés
-3-

on former FRI personnel probably would enhance such suspicions,
particularly in Latin Anerica where 'FBI" means "intelligence"
since ites WW IT activities there.

6. CC8/NC on occasion receives requests for advice to busi+
ness orgenizations as to setting up security systems at overseas
installations. We recently referred a request of this type, :
involving 6 major oil company, to the Physical Security element of
the Security Office. Conceivably, the Agency might make some
arrangement to advise Wackenhut of such requests, providing our own
Security Office is satisfied as to Weckenhut's competence. (We >“
could then place an Agency representative, if desired, Am the teaxi2
dispatched overseas by Wackenhut} should his compeny successfully
secure the contract.

T- Wackenhut seid he would be willing to dispatch teams to
“set up personal security systems for foreign chtefs of state .
whom the Agency wants protected. He is amenable, in fact, to any
reasonable application of his capabilities to Agency problems.

He would be willing to negotiete financing in equitable propor~
tions in the event an overt operation, set up at Agency behest,
were not financially self-susteining.

8. Wackenhut impressed me as a clean-cut, energetic, ambitious
young business man who is obviously proud of what e 3 to be
a@ superior organization of its type. He is interes profits,
but it is my impression he is sincerely eager to do what he can to
essist the government and feels that CIA offers one possible oppor=

. -tunity. Incidentally, he appears somewhat younger in person then __

in the pictures appearing in the promotional material given the
writer. :

‘9. Copies of this memorandum are being furnished those Agency

- components which might have an interest in utilizing subject com-

peny. Ingzirles may be directed to the vriter.
