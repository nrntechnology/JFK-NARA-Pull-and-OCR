NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER

A. Introduction

During his 11 or 12 years’ service in the KGS Second Chief
woe Directorate, NOSENKO said, he rose from case officer tu deputy
tla chief of a department and from lieutenant to lieutenant colonel
(or, as he has stated more recently, only to the rank 6 captain).
An English speaker, he had specialized. in operations against
- American targets in the USSR as he steadily advanced to higher
positions in the U.S, Embassy Section of the American Hepartment
(from entry on duty with the KGB in 1952 or 1353 until 1955,
and from January 1960 to January 1967) and in the Tourist Depart-
ment (from June 1955 to January 1960, and from January 1962 until
the defection). His duties took him to England in 1957 and 1958,
. Cuba in 1960, and Bulgaria in 1961 as well as to Switzerland in
1962 and 1964; also, NOSENKO made numerous trips within the USSR
in connectica with operations, inspections, ard conferences.
Commendations, twice accompanied by bonuses, were awarded to him
by the KGB Chairman in 1956, 1959, and 1961] and by the tiead of
. the Second Chief Directorate in 1957 and 1958; he was one of
70 Second Chief Directerate officers awarded the Order of the
‘Read Star in 1962; and in the same year he received a majal for
completing ten years of "irreproachable service, "* Thus,
according to NOSENKO, his defection ended a promising career
marked by promotions, responsible positions, extensive travel,
and many honors.

NOSENKO has discussed a large number of KGB operations, in-
eluding some in which he had a personal role, either as 2 par-
ticipant or as a supervisor, and others conducted by other KGB

r personnel in the First and Second Chief Directorate about which

he learned through his professional and personal contacts... :
Those in which he played a personal role are covered in this

part of the paper. All are included in Part VI. The text of

the paper distinguishes the information from collateral sources

and investigations from the details which NOSENKO has provided

eh the same topics. ‘ .

B. Entry into the KGB

NOSENKO has provided a wide range of dates for his entry
on duty with the KGB and has offered disparate descriptions of
the circumstances and procedures involved in his becoming a
KGB staff officer, His statements on these two topics are
presented under separate headings below. .

1. Date of Ertry

A range of dates between early 1952 and 2 April 1953 has
been given by NOSENKO as the time when he entered on duty with
the KGB, bet he has been most consistent in placing his entry
in the month of March 1953.* in summary, he has said the
beginning of 1952 (statement of 31 January 1964), May 1952 with
no day (statement of February 1964), 5 or 7 September 1952
(statement of 6 April 1964).\March 1953 with no day (statements
of 9 June 1962, 24 April 1966 and 27 October 1966), 12 or 15 or
17 March 1953 (statement of 8 April 1964), 13 or 15 March 1953
(statement*of 26 July 1965), and 2 April 1953 (statement of

-17 April 196€). When iast questioned about this subject, on

27 October 1966, NOSENKO acknowledged that he had lied when he
had earlier reported his entry as occurring 1n 1952. His state-
ments about the entry date are arranyed in chronological order
below.

9 June 1962 (first CIA meeting with NOSENKO): “in the
beginning of 1953 I came to Moscow /From duty with the GRU in
Primorsk/. This was 1953, in the beginning. in January. Well,
I came on leave to Moscow. I was staying at my father's dacha
there... I was then in the Navy GRU. So I ceme to Moscow on
leave and, while I was home_near Moscow at my father’s dacha,
ZGeneral Bogdan Zakharovich/ KOBULOV** dropped in on us. A con-
versation simply began. He said: ‘What are you doing?' I said:
‘I'm working in GRU. I worked in the Far East and now I'm work-
ing in the Baltic. I came here on leave.’ KOBULOV said: 'How
do you like the work?: I replied: ‘Well, speaking honestly, I
don't like the work.' ‘Well,' he said, ‘You better come to work
with us, Where do you want to co? Into intelligence or counter-
intelligence?'... I did not want to go into intelligence. I

* Several of NOSENKO's remarks about his date of entry into
the KGB were made during CIA questioning abour how and
when he first learned of the KGB agent “ANDREY"; the lead —
to "ANDREY" was one of the two pieces of information which
NOSENKO offered to sell when he approached CIA in 1962
(see Part II.B.); the "ANDREY- case is discussed at
greater length in Part VI.D.3.b.

“** Other sources have reported that KOBULOV was expelled

from the State Security apparatus in 1946 and that he did’
not return to a position of authority until a few days.

, after Lavrentiy BERIYA became MGB-MVD. Minister: on 9 or

10 March 1953. As of 1952, KOBULOV was working in East

: Germany for both Wismut A.G., a uranium ore-mining con-
cern, and for the Soviet .contingent to the Allied Control
. Commission. KOBULOV was arrested at the same time as.
BERIYA, along with others in the KGB. See Part V.B.2.

consider that only people who have seven, even ten years’ ex-
perience in counterintelligence work should be sent to intelli-
gence. After this, let them go into positive intelligence.
Then they know how counterintelligence operates... Well, when
KOBULOV asked me where I wanted to work, I answered: ‘It is
better, of course, to go into counterintelligence.' ‘Well,' he
said, ‘Good. Look, drop in to see me for a minute sometime.'
This was simple conversation. Nothing official. A week later . t
I got a telephone call. They were calling from Personnel and : ,
told me to stop by. I went. ‘Come into this room,' /they told

me/, ‘it's not necessary to fill out a questionnaire (anketa).

We have already obtained your personal file from the GRU. Go

Girectly to the central entrance. A pass has already been

tariat of Bogdan Zakharovich KOBULOV,' Well, I went. KOBULOV
had been summoned somewhere high up in the government, and his
assistant received me. ‘'How_about working in the American De-
partment?' he /the assistant/ asked. ‘Well. good. Go there
right. now.' Well, I wert to the Second Directorate... His
ZKOBULOV's/ assistant sent me directly to the Second Directo-
rate, the American Department, the First Section, working with
American correspondents...in '53, in March, in March '53. STALIN
had just died."*

+ “BL January 1964: Yuriy Ivanovich GUK was reassigned from
the KGB Second Chief Directorate "in something like 1952," :
HNOSENKO said, “exactly just about the time when I came from . 4

the GRU to the KGB. He was already gone by that time."* | Poa

February 1964: After his defection on 4 February 1964,
-NOSENKO prepared an official statement about his biography.
He said that he had entered the KGB in 1952, and he shifted
‘the dates of most of the events during the. 1945-1955 periog one
year backwards from the version given in 1962. This was dis-
cussed with NOSENXO, and. he repeated the new dates; he then
studied and approved an official statement on his biography
(for the Intelligence Community) which contained the new dates,
including his claim that he entered on duty with the KGB in ; }
about May 1952. ; ; i |

6 April 1964: Confronted with the above inconsistencies,
NOSENKO said that he returned to Moscow in August 1952 and during
the same month had a conversation with KGB personnel about getting
a job. The interview continued with the following dialogue:

Question: You came (to Moscow) in January?

NOSENKO: No, it wasn't January, it was the second part of
1952. Yes, before that I was in the GRU...
Maybe - if I tell you 7 - 7 September - maybe
it was 5, I don't know. :

Question: ...What date did you enter on duty with KGB?
NOSENKO: I don’t remember.
Question: Early September 1952?

NOSENKO: Early September 1952, yes... I came and the
first few days was sitting in a room with
KUTYREV, RAKOVSKIY, and GROBOV, in Room 615.
Yes, it was 7 September when I had joined...
7 or 5... And so the first few weeks I had been
. reading cases, studying forms; I worked like
that (during) December, January, February...
No, it was March, yes, after STALIN's death,
after the reorganization. And at the end of
March I was transferred to the attaches cases...**

_¥ This would place the entry date some time at the beginning
of 1952, for the KGB defector GOLITSYN has reported that ors
GUK was transferred from the Second Chief Directorate in
January 1952. ; . . 4

** NOSENKO later settled on June or July 1954 as the time of, .
7 this transfer. Part V.C. covers the period when, according
‘+. ¢@ NOSENKO, he was engaged in operations against the U.S.

: military attaches in Moscow. a

J 8 April 1964: The interrogator pointed out to NOSENKO that
he had on different occasions dated his entry into the KGB as
January 1952, March 1953, and in September 1952. The questioning
continued: a

Question: Which is the truth?

did I say it /the other dates/? You see, I
finished the Institute in 1949.. Then I defended
my diploma, and then came the State exams. I.
passed all.the exams except one - “Foundations o
Marxism-Leninism! the philosophy. And I had to
take all the examinations over again. All of ;
them. -I took four, passed three, flunked one. i
Just the same, all four had to be taken over {
again. For that reason 1 graduated, or I received
the diploma from the Institute in 1950, although
officially I graduated in 1949, This is an un- i
pleasant ching and I did not want to mention it. i
And right after that I was sent to the GRU.* The

rest is just as I told you, word-for-word. This

was the only thing. And then, after I said it,

I did not want to correct it. To twist around

again. And the mistake I made was about my work

in the KGB, It was not 1952, of course, but . i
1953... It was 12 or 17 or 15 March. KOBULOV : i
accepted me right away. STALIN was still not ,
dead and I was already accepted. March 1953,
about the 15th, about 15 March 1953.

26 July 1965: "At the end of 1952 I came to Moscow from
Sovetsk in Primorskiy Kray; near Baltiysk. I had worked in the
Naval Intelligence Point (MRP) there. My aim in coming to fO “3
Moscow was to get out of this work in the MRP. I couldn't : 4
stand that work. I couldn't stand that work... I arrived in :
Moscow at the end of 1952, December... I don't remember exactly
the date of the order appointing me an officer in the KGB. It
was 13 or 15 March 1953." ,

- 17 April 1966 (letter to CIA case officer): "From August '
1952 until 1953 I worked at the Intelligence Point of the Naval
_ Intelligence cf the 4th Fleet in,Sovetsk, where I received the

rank o£ lieutenant of the Administrative Service. From 2 April

1953 until 4 February 1964 I worked in the Second Chief Direc-

torate of the MGB-KGB."

: ; 24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement): "In
the middle of March /1953/ KOBULOV's assistant, Colonel
SAVITSKIY called me at home and told me to come to see KOBU- Co fs
LOV... I worked in the First Section, First /American/ Depart-
ment from the middle of March 1953 until July 1955."

27 October 1966: NOSENKO reaffirmed that he entered the
KGB in mid-March 1953. He said that he had lied when he earlier.
said that he had joined the KGB in 1952, and that he knew he was
'. lying at the times he made these statements. Asked why he had -
lied, he replied: “There was no sense." NOSENKO then went on a
- to explain that because he was only an average student and
because he was a heavy drinker, he had been found unsuitable

T"Since April 1966, NOSENKO has said he joined the GRU in’
1951, a@ year later. : ae ae :

by the KGB entry commission when he first applied in 1950.
Therefore, NOSENKO continued, he hed been trying to conceal
this fact from CIA by moving events back a year, for he thought
CIA would not have believed him if he reportea that he was
first rejected by the KGB and was later accepted. ;

2. Circumstances and Procedures of Entry

Although NOSENKO has consistently associated his entry into
the KGB with his discussions with General KOBULOV,* he has been
inconsistent concerning the content of their conversation, when
it oceurred, its relationship in time to other events (see
Part IV.B.), and where it took place, at his father's dacha or
at KOBULOV's dacha. Also, wherees NOSENKO said in 1962 that
there were virtually no administrative formalities prerequisite
to his entry, he recalled in 1964 that he had had conversations i
with various KGB personnel officers and (at home) had completed :
a KGB questionnaire and a biographic form. NOSENKO. was question~ 5
ed at length on these points during 1964 and 1965. As a result, i
he provided lengthy descriptions of his various interviews at |
KGB Headquarters and of the questionnaire and other documents he
completed. In April 1966, however, NOSENKO reverted to his boo
original statement of 1962: There were no interviews with KGB :
personnel officers, and he implied that he had filled out no i 4
official forms. His various statements are presented in chrono-
logical order below.

father was Minister of the Shipbuilding Industry... A conversa- i
tion simply began. He said: ‘What are you doing?’ I said: ‘I'm Hl

8 April 1964: “It was February (19531. KOBYLCV was in

--exactly. Yes. It was-in February. I saw him at the cottage...- =

By this timeé=i had been in Moscow six weeks... KOLULOV was in
February. He went to see my father at the Ministry. It was

the end of the day. It was late and my father invited him to
come along to’ the summer home. It happened to be a Saturday.
KOBULOV's wife: stayed in Germany. He was just here for a short
TDY.* My father invited him to spend. Saturday night. and Sunday
at the dacha... On Sunday we were playing billiards and KOBULOV
asked me what I was doing. I told him "nothing,’ that I was at
the disposal of the [GRU} Fersonnel Department. I said: ‘I
don’t want to go back to Baltiysk, to the Baltic Sea, because IT
don't like the work there. I'm not doing anything there. I get

no satisfaction from the work.' He said: ‘Well, you should be
utilized somehow... Do you want me to call the KGB Personnel -
them look you over?' I told him: ‘All right.' He called, and

he must have given our number to them, our home phone. I was

called subsequently by the Personnel Department of the KGB. In
February. They told me to come see them at Houge No. 12. They
had a pass for me... So I went. Picked up my pass and went...
{NOSEXKO next gives a description of his route to the KGB build-

ing, his. receipt of a pass, and his visit to the Central KGB

‘Personnel Office.} They talked to me. This man - I don't know
who or what he was - asked where I worked before and all that.
He said: 'O.K. We'll request your file from GRU. We will check
you out and will let you know whether or not we will take you.'
That's all.” NOSENKO was asked whether he completed any forms
or questionnaires. "No. Not there. They gave me three copies
of forms to take home. There were so many questions. About my
parents, my education, my residences, addresses. I filled all
this out... Finally I completed all three copies and called
them. I was told that this time I would not need a pass,. that

I should just. go to the entrance, and the person (the personnel
officer] would.come down-and take the papers from me. I went,
brought the papers, and he took them from me, and also three

copies of my handwritten autobiography... Then I was called by

the personnel people once more. And at that time another
officer talked to me, and this time I knew who was talking to
me, because I was told to go to talk to ROZHENKO [first name
‘unknown, later identified as a Section Chief in the Personnel
Department]. This was in March... Just as soon as STALIN died,
KOBULOV came back from Germany immediately. He must have been
sunmoned by BERIYA or someone. And so, in just a few days -
evidently he did not forget - I gota call. It was Bogdan
Zakharovich's assistant. He told me to go to the central
entrance, that I didn't need a pass. I remember it as if.it
just happened. I went in the uniform of a lieutenant, but with
@ civilian overcoat. This was, maybe, the 10th of March... 1
gat down [in KOBULOV's office]. JI thought it would be for five
minutes. I waited there almost two hours. The assistant came
out a few times and told me that Bogdan zakharovich is very,
very busy, but that he would give’ me an escort. Some senior
lieutenant came up to me and told me to follow him... We went

“up to the sixth floor of the old building. I-remembér: it as

though it just happened. I sat there about five or seven
minutes. Then I was told to go in. 1 announced myself. He
said: "Yes, I know. Sit down. My name is SHUBNYAKOV, Fedor

Grigoryevich."| He told me he was the Deputy Chief of the”

- Second Chief Directorate and that they had talked things over

and decided. He said that they wanted to offer me a position .

A
, 25 April 1964: NOSENKO again described the KGB question- : . ‘| -
naire and autobiographic forms he had filled out at home and ;
recalled that he had also signed a secrecy agreement in the i
personnel office. He also remembered that he had made several

additional phone calls to the KGS personnel office and described

his second visit there to talk ts ROZHENKO: “At the end of : '
February I was told again to stcp 1n the Pass Office and pick up :

a@ pass and go to the same floor, but another room. They told me :

I would have to talk to ROZHENKO today. He was a Chief of i
Section, of the Personnel Section, So we had a talk. It was :
the same thing again. He said: 'Tell me about yourself.‘ 3ut

he just wanted to look me over. And after that they said: ‘All

right, we_have not gotten all your documents yet from your

fmilitary/ district. So wait.'"

26 April 1965: NOSENKO recounted his conversation with
KOBULOV, saying that it took piace at KOBULOV's dacna in Usov, }
where he and his parents were visiting in January 1953. NOSENKO i Fy
continued: "I was called at my family’s dacha in February. :

They said it was State Security calling and that I was to
report. I did this on the next day. Probably I thenreported..

to House No. 12. As officer talked to me about my” education,
service, and so on, Biographic questions.. Then he gave me a
blank for my autobiography and a four to six-page anketa (bio-
graphic form). I filled these cut at home. The next day I
called in and was told to come to the Eighth Entry. The officer
came down, and I gave him the forms and photographs of myself.
They said they would call me. i did nothing from January to
March. January was leave. In February and March I was at GRU
Personnel's disposal." After STALIN's funeral NCSENKO was
summoned to KOBULOV's office. His assistant, SAVITSKIY, told
NOSENKO to wait. After more than an hour had passed, SAVITSKIY
sent him to SHUBNYAKOV's office. There he learned that he would
be assigned to the U.S. Embassy Section and was introduced to
the Chief of the American Department, GORBATENKO, The official

C. fo June 1955 (American Department)

1. Introduction

936

Depending upofi which date he has given fer entering the KGB,
NOSENKO's first assignment in the U.S. Embassy Section of the
American Department, working on American correspondents living
in Moscow, lasted for about six to eighteen months. From that
job, he said, he moved in 1954 to operations against U.S.. Mili-.
tary Attaches assigned to the Moscow Embassy, remaining in the
game section until being transferred in June 1955. His activi-
ties, as NOSENKO described them, and pertinent collateral infor-
mation on his targets while he was in the U.S. Embassy Section
are reviewed below. :

2. Operations Against Correspondents

On the day cf his acceptance into the KSB, NOSENKO was
taken directly to the offices of the U.S. Embassy Section.
There he met the section chief, V.A. KCZLOV, wno told NOSENKO
that he would take over the work of the departing case officer,
Captain Anatoliy TORMOZOV, in operations against American cor-
respondents in Moscow.

a. KGB Files on SHAPIRO, GILNORE, SALISBURY and WHITNEY

When NOSENKO reported for work the following day, accord-
ing to statements made on 8 April 1964, he found a desk in Room

615. “There were three other guys sitting there. At first I

was running traces, and at the same time I was reading. the files
on journalists... I think there were seven files in all, and I
didn't see any other." NOSENKO listed these files as those on
Henry SHAPIRO, Eddy GILMORE (as well as one cn GILMORE's wife
SEREBRYAXOVA and her sister CHERNYSHEVA), Harrison SALISBURY
and Thomas WHITNEY.*

During the 1962 meetings with'CIA, NOSENKO identified
SHAPIRO as an "old agent of ours." He said that WEITNEY "worked
for.us while he was in Moscow and gave us some material, but he
refused to work for us when he left the country and would not
contact us in the United States.” GILMORE, NOSENKO said, was an

, active recruitment target in 1953 and 1954, but NOSENKO did not

know whether he was recruited. Likewise, he did not know the
Status of SALISBURY as of 1953.

NOSENKO stressed that the files he was given to read during
the early period of his KGB service were developmental files
(delo formulyar) rather than the operational files of the agents.
The developmental files were less sensitive, and from them "you
would never be able to figure out whether he [the subject of
the file} is an agent or not." NOSENKO explained that, once a’
person becomes an agent, another file is set up, and these agent

¥ NOSENKO made clear that he was not the case officer responsi-
ble for the more important correspondents: "KOZLOV himself
was working with them, the chief of the section himself--with
SHAPIRO,. with SHAPIRO's wife. I also know that KOZLOV was.
working with WHITNEY and with (Andrew J.] STEIGER... For
each of these persons there was an operational file which I

files were held by the chief of the section, KOZLOV. NOSENKO
stated that he read the files on these seven perscns "slowly

and made some extracts for myself in my personal log--such things
as notations of their dates of arrival, things I could not remem-
ber.“ He was also given the files. on the agents surrounding
these correspondents, their drivers, maids, and ccoks.

b. Agents Reporting on Correspondents

NOSENKO said he was responsible for haridling the agents who
were reporting on SHAPIRO, WHITNEY, SALISBURY and the GILMOREs
and met with them regularly to learn whether "anything was new,
who did SHAPIRO meet, what might be interesting in his behavicr,
what might be suspicious in his behavior, who he is contacting,
etc." He then reported to KOZLOV and would sometimes prepare 4
written report of his conversations with the agents. Asked to
describe these meetings, NOSENKO replied: "Let us take the same
case of SHAPIRO. I would meet drivers about three times. a month
or evan two times. At the meeting I would ask the driver what
was new in SHAPIPC's behavior since our last meeting, whether

. SHAPIRO had suspicious contacts with foreigners, akout his meet-

om

ings with Russians, were they conducted openly or, perhaps, was
SHAPIRO walking behind the person he met. And then the man
{agent} would begin his report. Of course, if he spots anything
suspicious he calls immediately, and I would see nim the next
morning, Otherwise, I would tell him at the meeting that I

would see him again in about ten days or in two weeks, but if
there was something interesting he should call immediately.

It was the same with the maid and the cook, Upon returning to
the office I would have to report to KUZLOV about my meetings,
either orally or in writing. If, for example, [V.M.]’ KOVSHUK
{also of the U.S. Embassy Section) had a meeting with his agents,
he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV or as soon as conveni-
ent to both. If the meetings were taking place late in the day
and lasted until midnight or later and.there were no written
Materials submitted at the meeting, I could go heme and then re-
port the next morning." ~ ,

KOZLOV accompanied NOSENKO to meetings with the various
agents surrounding the correspondents. "At first he was teach-
ing me. Then he would go in cases when something interesting
would begin to develop, even when it hadn't yet begun to develop
but when there may have been a hint in a case of some other case
officer.”

NOSENKO's agent network consisted mainly of domestic and
clerical personnel in contact with the correspondents and their
families, Asked to describe them, he said on 15 April 1964:

"My first agent was a woman agent, a cook, who was working at
GILMORE's place. She also worked at the Associated Press later.
Her codename was 'AGLODINA’, a funny one. My second agent was

a chauffeur whose codename, I think, was ‘SERGEY'. I think he
was driving WHITNEY. Then I also had SHAPIRO's chauffeur, a
funny little fellow. In other words, charwomen, chauffeurs, : »
this was my agentura [agent network]." Although NOSENKO was~
able to give'a breakdown of this network in terms of the number
and type of agents targetted against particular individuals, he
had forgotten their true names and could not provide detailed
personality information on any of them.. He explained: "I don't
remember now. They all passed by like a river because they were
turned over often." NOSENKO did recall that it was he. who .

selected and handled the agent who was placed in SHAPIRO's office

as a secretary; this agent. had earlier worked in the offices of
Hoscow News, an English-language newspaper published in Moscow

‘that he had taken over KOSIENKO from TORMOZOV upon entering the

‘agents to other case officers in the U.S. Embassy Section with

> been suspected as such on the basis of his long stay in Moscow,

He first identified GILMORE's cook, "AGLODINA,” as Yelena
$. KOSIENKO in the fall of 1965, while reviewing a list of Sov-
fets employed by Americans in Moscow. He. told CIA at that time

U.S. Enbassy Section in 1953, and that she subsequently worked
for and reported on GILMORE's successor, Richard KASISCHKE. |
NOSEXKO said that KOSIENKO "never provided any interesting in-
formzticn."

NOSENKO estimated that he was responsible for handling 10
to 12 agents in operations against the correspondents. This, _
he said, was a normal load, although more experienced case offi- . ‘
cers might have as many as 15. In April 1964 NOSENKO broke his
agentura down as follows:

|

Target : Agents
Eddie GILMORE Two agents, the cook and the driver;

one operational contact; a part-time
cleaning girl; and a girlfriend of
GILMORE's sister-in-law, who reported
on the sister-in-law and GILMORE's

wife.
Thomas WHITNEY _ One agent, his driver.
Henry SHAPIRO Three agents, SHAPIRO's secretary i

and his cahuffeur, plus an old woman
who was a relative of SHAPIRO's wife
and lived with the SHAPIROs in Mos-
cow, (The secretary and chauffeur
later worked for Kenneth BRODNEY and.
reported on him to NOSENKO; BRODNEY
temporarily took SHAPIRO's place in
Moscow.)

Harrison SALISBURY Two agents, SALISBURY's driver, "SER-
GEY" and a part-time cleaning girl.

NOSENKO classified two other of his agents as "neutral," in :
that they did not have specific targets on whom to report. The , ‘
first of these was the director of MOSGRAN, a Russian-language 4
training program for foreigners in Moscow. His cryptonym was
"RAKETA," but NOSENKO could not recall his true name. The sec-
ond, “VOLODINK,” was a female teacher in this same program who
instructed some of the correspondents, including BRODNEY, and.
Embassy employees in their homes; he could not recall the true
name of “VOLODINK." When NOSENKO was relieved of his responsi-
bility for the correspondents in 1954, he turned over all of his

the exception of “RAKETA" and “VOLODINK," whom he continued to
handle in his work with military attaches.

@. Information from Other Sources -

SHAPIRO was identified as a KGB agent. by GOLITSYN in 1961,°
before the lead was received from NOSENKO, and he had previously

his unusually good access to Soviet information sources, and his
marriage to a Seviet national. SHAPIRO was mentioned as a KGB

14-00000

: agent by a eryptonym (known to NOSEXKO - and contirmed by GOLITY
eppearing in the CHEREPANOV papers. * : .

pines The KGB defector Nikol: KHOKLOV' had earlier identified the. leg
* Polish-born wife of WHITNEYas a KGB agent, an allegation which. me
she denied, and it had been ‘Long assumed that WHITNEY too had a :
reached some sort of accommodation with the KGB because of this nS a
fact and because of the leng, curation of his tour as a correspond-.” 5:

ent in Moscow. '

GILMORE also had been suspected by CIA before NOSENKO's in-
formation was received. He served in Moscow for’ 12 years, from
1941 to 1953, and 1S married to a Soviet national. ~

wu

SALISBURY served two short tours, of about one year each, ‘
in Moscow during the 1950's, During the second of these, he }-
became enamored with the Pole who was to become WHITNEY's wife : {
(see above) and was during this period a subject of criticism by i
other American correspondents in Moscow for his pro-Soviet arti-
cles. When WHITNEY married the Pole shortly after STALIN's
death, SALISBURY returned to the United States and his articles
took on an anti-Soviet tone.

NOSENKO claimed no involvement with the other two American
correspondents whom he idcestified as KGB agents, STEVENS and : 4
STEIGER, both the subjects of a considerable amount of derogatory ;
information in CIA files. They are discussed in Part VI.D.z. i
under the heading of NOSENKO's American leads. i

3. Operations Against Military Attache Personnel ;

Some time in the first half of 1954 NOSENKO was. relieved of :
his responsibilities for the correspondent cases, and from then
until his transfer from the American Department he handled KGB
Second Chief Directorate operations against the officer person-
nel of the U.S. Military Attache's office. NOSENKO's account of
the turnover of the correspondent files to his successor and of
the acceptance of the attache files is presented below.

meeb diab bliniilanncle artim,

_— - 8 April 1964: "I took over the Military Attache cases
from Nikolay KHRENOV,.. When I was leaving in 1955, I turned
the attache files over to Valeriy BUDYLDIN."

- 10 April 1964: "I made a mistake... I said I accepted
the cases from KHRENOV when I was taking on the Militery Attache
work. This is not right. KHRENOV was not working in the First
(U.S. Embassy) Section; he was working in the First (American)
Department. I took over the cases from--let's see, there was
ZHUKOV and Vladimir Aleksandrovich CHURANOV, and here was my :
_ table (desk), and I accepted the cases from Pavel Fedorovich :
PANKRATOV. This was in the beginning of 1954." .

Be See

- 15 April 1964: NOSENKO said that he thought he turned

Ha over the correspondent files to.F.V. KISLITSYN (who returned :.
t _. . to the USSR from Australia in‘May 1954). NOSENKO asked when: |
Poe the PETROV's defected in Australia; he explained that he was a

“. not sure about KISLITSYN and could have given them to another
officer. “If KISLITSYN came {back from Australia] in 1953, then
- it was to KISLITSYN. Otherwise, it was someone else.” wo,

= 18 June 1964: "KISLITSYN came into the First Section in
1954 and I gave him the files on American correspondents. BUDYL-
DIN also joined the section this year and took the files on the

Attache and his assistants from PANKRATOV. BUDYLDIN left
later that year and turned those files over to me... Yuriy
LEONTIYEV joined the section in 1955, and I gave him the files
on the Army Attache and his assistants."

NOSENKO has also been indefinite as to the date he, assumed
responsibilities for the attaches. As noted above, he said on
10 April 1964 that he received the files an the beginning of

1954. He had earlier said that he worked on the correspondents ~

“only about six months." If the date of March 1953, which he
most often gave for his entry ‘nto the KGB, is correct this would
place the turnover in the fall of 1953. On other ‘occasions he
has said specifically that he turned over the correspondent cases
and began work against the attaches 1n January 1954, on still
others that this occurred in May 1954. In February 1965, NOSENKO
said that he could not remember when he changed assignments.

a. Agents Reporting on Military Attaches
Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network

tary Attaches during this period which began in 1954, NO-
SENKO replied: "There were two maids, a cook, drivers*...
about ten persons, plus the agent ‘SERVIZNIY' and the one
with the code name 'DMITRIYEV'... These additional two
agents, about 12 or 13 agents altogether." with one ex-
ception, this network remained constant until NOSENKO trans-
ferred from the U.S. Embassy Section in mid-1955. He met
each agent about once a week, except for the chauffeurs who
were met three times a month in a safehouse or on the
street. According to NOSENKO, this network was “just a
supporting agentura, which very seldom was worthwhile," the
main source of information on the Military Attaches being the

Se

at

Newly added to the network while NOSiNKO held this
position was a maid inserted to report on Army Attache Earl
L. MICKELSON and his successor, Fillmore K. MEARNS. Her
name, .NOSENKO ‘thought, was NOVIKOVA. She was an English~
speaking university graduate but "hid her knowledge of
English in order to overhear conversations or read letters
without taking them outside."

Besides NOVIKOVA, NOSENKO named one other maid who was

his agent, Mariya NEVEROVA, code nane “SHVEDOVA," and she

was targetted against the Assistant Army Attache, Ira

RICHARDS. He described NEVEROVA as a "little, old,’ thin’
oman," from whom ne never obtained anything of interest. ty
They met in a safehouse on Kuznetskiy Most. i

Of the KGS agents among the chauffeurs, NOSENKO identi-
fied Nikolay SRNYRYEV, who was used by various of the at-
taches. "He reported where they went, what they said,
whether they took notes or photographs, whether they had
unusual packages with them, and so on.”

then viewing photographs in September 1964, NOSEWKO

had been working in the Embassy since its establishment,
starting first as a messenger boy and, in NOSENKO's time,
performing clerical tasks. VOROBYEV had no direct connec-

did not know why he had been given VOROBYEV to handle in
1954. The main function of this agent was delivering to
NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephone listings of the
Embassy, issued monthly.

“DMITRIYEV's" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV:
NOSENKO saw this name on a 1962 phone list and thought, but
was not sure, that this was his agent. . An electrician who an . ne
worked on the Embassy's electrical wiring systems and eleva- . sy
tor, "DMITRIYEV" reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires and

*—The Military Attaches used a pool of. five drivers at random,
NOSENKO ‘said. Apart from the permanent driver for the senior .
attache, none were targetted. against individual members of the

+ attache office. a

other wires he had observed in the. Embassy as well as ‘on: the
-gecurity measures on the top floors. Like VOROBYEV, “DMITRI-
YEV" had no direct connection with the Military. Attaches.

In September 1964 NOSENKO was shown a series of 260 bio-
graphic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American En-
bassy in Moscow. Each card contained a photograph of the per-
son involved and short bicgraphic notes, including his name —
and job in. the Embassy. The first time.he went through these: .
cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see only, the photographs; No- > i

. SENKO did not identify the photographs of SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV : es ara:
- put said that the face of VOROBYEV was familiar, adding that “ .
: he thought his name was VOROBYEV. When shown the biographic

information on SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV, he identified each of then

as his agents during the 1954-1955 period in the American De-

partment and equated them to the cryptonyms given previously. u

In the case of SHNYRYEV, when shown the bicgraphic information,

which listed SHNYRYEV as “chauffeur for the Military Attache," -

NOSENKO exclaimed: "Oh ay God, this is my own agent." He. .

later said it was a good photograph of SIHINYRYEV.

b. NOSENKO's Targets

As the Second Chief Directorate case officer responsible
- for operations against American Military (Aray) Attaches sta~ : F
tioned in Moscow,* his main task was not to recruit them but !
rather was to prevent the attaches from collecting intelligence.

He has used this statement, about his main task (identical with

that of other U.S. Embassy Section officers working against .

the Army and Navy Attaches) to support his claim that no U.S.

Armed Forces Attaches vere recruited by the KGB from 1953 un- i
til his defection in 1964. He has also said that this is one
reason he knows relatively little about the personal back-
grounds of his various targets during this period--the empha—
sis was on surveillance instead of development for recruitment—
- “ purposes. Asked in February 1965 to list the Army Attache per-
as sonnel for whom he was directly responsible during 1954 and :
. 1955, NOSENKO gave the following names: "MICKELSON, MEARNS, |

dealec utettas Mo eibabwe ne

RICHARDS, FELCHLIN, BENSON, MULE, STROUD, and CARDELLA."** His
knowledge. of the activities of these targets and of KGB action
against them, coupled with information from other sources, is
discussed in the following paragraphs.

; : aval Attaches were handled by ZHUKOV during this period, NO-
: SENKO said, while Air Attaches were initially handled by CHURA~- ‘ :
NOY. When CHURANOV left the section in early 1954, he turned :
over the Air Attache files to PANKRATOV, who turned them over

later in the year to KHRENOV.

pore **This is the order given by NOSENKO. The list comprises two
i generations of Army Attaches in Moscow and is neither in al-
phabetical order nor in terms of date of service in Moscow.
It is, however, in descending order of rank from Colonel MICKEL=
_SON through Captain MULE ‘to ‘Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA. .
Questioned about these officers in a different context, NOSENKO
indicated knowledge of their ranks. Not mentioned by NOSENKO ioe s
_ was George VAN LAETHEM, Assistant Army Attache in Moscow from pis
- August 1951 to August 1953 (prior to the time when NOSENKO said
* he was responsible for work against the military attache office).
VAN LAETHEM returned to Moscow in 1955, however, and was at- ~
tached to the Army Attache staff again from 19 March to 19 May
- 1955, during which. time NOSENKO claimed he was still responsible
. for this group. ee . i. Te ns

(4) MICKELSON

NOSENKO has identified Earl L. MICKELSON as a colonel
and the Military Attache in Moscow during 1954 and 1955.
PANKRATOV was the case officer originally handling MICKEL-
SON, and the case was turned over to NOSENKO in 1954.
When asked about agents who might have been working against
MICKELSON, NOSENKO said that there was one cook, a KGB
operational contact whose name he did not recall, and
NICKELSON's maid, whose name NOSENKO believed vas NOVIKOVA;
the cook and NOVIKOYA went to work for MICKELSON after NO-
SENKO had left the U.S. Embassy Section, In addition to
these two, the only other source reporting on WICKELSON was
his chauffeur, whose name. NOSENKO also did not remember.
NOSENKO said that the KGB learned nothing interesting about
MICKELSON from concealed microphones, telephone taps, or
surveillance, and that no operational approach or recruit
ment was attempted. There was, in fact, no interesting or
derogatory information on MICKELSON from any source.

According to information in CIA files, MICKELSON was
involved in at least two incidents inside the Soviet Union
which NOSENKO has not reported. In May 1954 he was arrested
in Tbilisi on the (false) charge of having photographed #
bridge, but he persuaded the Militia not to press charges.
In August 1954 MICKLISON was arrested again for illegal
photographs soutn otf KHARKOV; on this occasion he was held
for two hours before being released.

(ii) MEARNS

NOSENKO identified Fillmore K.. NEARNS as MICKELSON's
replacement and said that he was the responsible case of-
ficer. There were two agents and one operational contact
working against "EARNS. Of these, NOSENKO could recall the
name only of NOVIXOVA, the same maid who reported earlier on
MICKELSON. Besides being told to attempt to overhear MICKEL-
SON's conversations NOVIKOVA was instructed to search his
clothing and tu copy any notes she might find, but she
never overheard or found anything of interest to the KGB.
NOSENKO recalled that MEARNS’ personal effects were searched
by the KGB while they were being shipped to Moscow from the
United States, and that all his service records had been
discovered and photographed.* NOSENKO described MEARNS
as being more "active" in Moscow than MICKELSON had been and
said that information from concealed microphones showed ~
him to have a strong character. Nothing of interest con-
cerning him was received from these microphones or from tele-
phone taps. .

CIA has no derogatory or otherwise significant informa-
tion on MEARNS, who replaced MICKELSON.

(4441) RICHARDS
NOSENKO identified Ira B. RICHARDS as a lieutenant

colonel who served as the Assistant drmy Attache in Moscow.
NOSENKO’ said that he was the case officer working against

¢NOSENKO has told this same story about MICKELSON.

RICHARDS. The one agent reporting on RICHARDS whom NOSENKO
could name was the maid Mariya NEVEROVA, KGB cryptonym
*"SHVEDOVA,” but she had never provided any worthwhile in-
formation about RICHARDS. In addition, some Soviet drivers
repsrted on RICHARDS, but nothing useful was cbtained from |
then.
1
:

According to CIA records, RICHARDS served in Moscow
from July 1954 to July 1956, There was a microphone in the
office which he shared first with MICKELSON and later with
MEARNS. RICHARDS confirmed that Mariya NEVEROVA was his
maid and described her as a "mousy" woman who had a heart
attack during the period she was employed by him. (This :
incident was not recalled by NOSENKO.) For about four :
months of his Moscow tour, RICHARDS took Russian-language
lessons from Ludmila GROMAKOVA in his apartment. During - ‘
these lessons, KICHARDS often discussed labor conditions and... : +
wages in the United States and, on one occasion, had her - ' ;
record her speech on his tape recorder. GROMAKOVA was preg~
nant and unmarried at the time. (NOSENKO has named GROMAKOVA
as a KGB agent in another context but has not mentioned her
contacts with RICHARDS.)* RICHARDS identified one "Volodya"
{i.e., first name Vladimir) as his principal driver. About
62 ars old in 1954, Volodya was the son of a rich jeweler
in Moscow during the Revolution. Volodya himself was well
educated and, on one occasion while picnicking outside Mos-
cow, he spoke intelligently with RICHAKDS about the Revolu-
tion, propaganda, and news media, (NOSENKO did not know of
Volo ) Purther details from RICHARDS are given in the |
following, section on FELCHLIN. | .

(iv) FELCHLIN

NOSENKO identified Noward L. FELCHLIN as a lieutenant
colonel who served as Assistant Army Attache in Moscow and
stated that he was FELCHLIN's case officer. FELCHLIN was in
the Soviet Union during 1954 and part of 1955, until being
declared versona non grata. NOSENKO did not recall the
nams: of any agents specifically targetted against FELCHLIN,
although he thought FELCHLIN must have had a maid and she
would have been a KGB agent. Additionally, NOSENKO said,
the Assistant Military Attaches shared a pool of cars and
drivers, and these were his agents. Unable to recall the
precise date of FELCHLIN's expulsion, NOSENKO related it to
some event regarding Soviets stationed in the United States : |

oe ee henna tn get.

for which the Soviet Government decided to reply in kind.

MNOSENKO was imprecise as to the pretext used to expel FELCH-

LIN, but said the action was based on information which had

been accumulated from a number of sources and incidents.

‘ For example, FELCHLIN had been caught taking some photographs
and a report had been written; along with other similar
indications of FELCHLIN's activities and reports of agents
in contact with FELCHLIN, the report was filed away for pos-
sible future use. NOSENKO was questioned further on FELCH-
LIN during the February 1965 interrogations. He said then
that FELCHLIN alone had been declared persona non grata,
and that no other attaches had been involved. NOSENKO

explained his having but few dctails concerning this action
by the fact that it took place after NOSENZO had trans-—
ferred from the American Department to the Tourist Depart-
ment in June 1955. NCSENKO knew nothing, of FELCHLIN's .
background. . :

Other sources have reported that FELCHLIN visited the
USSR as a merchant seaman and a diplomatic courier before
arriving in July 1953 as Army Attache. He served in the
latter capacity for one year, until July 1954, when he was
asked to leave the country. (He had previously served in
Austria and West Germany and had been in official, contact
with known GRU officers at both posts, as well as in the
United States.) During his entire tour in Moscow he was
the subject of intensive KGB interest. Shortly after his z
arrival, in September 1953, FELCHLIN, with fellow Assistant H
Army Attache Martin J. MANHOFF, and two Air Force attaches
took a train trip to Siberia, the first such trip permitted
American attaches in many years. Six months later, on t
25 March 1954, the Soviet newspaper Trud carried an article
saying that FELCHLIN and his companion: ‘Thad lost some of
their “spy documents" on the. train, FELCHDLIN said this
charge was false. On another cccasion, while travelling
with a British Military Attache, FELCHLIN returned to his
train compartment to find a scantily clad Soviet female in
his bunk. (NOSENKO recalis neither of these incidents.)

In June 1954, while in the company of Lieutenant Colonel F.J.

YEAGER, an Assistant Army Attache, FELCHLIN was arrested in

Kiev by a Soviet Army officer for photographing a military

target. (NOSENKO has never mentioned YEAGER's name; when ,
told the name and asked for an identification, NOSENKO :
said that he had heard it and that he thought YEAGER was ;

4
4

the Air Force Attache.) A large crowd gathered and, after
some jostling, FELCHLIN and YEAGER were taken to a Militia
station where they were ordered to sign a confession. They
were held eleven hours, and their arrest caused the American
ambassador to deliver a strong protest note. FELCHLIN was
told on 3 July 1954 that he had 48 hours to get out of the |
Soviet Union. No specific charges were mentioned. Major ,
Walter A. MCKINNEY, the U.S. Air Attache and one of FELCHLIN's |
travelling companions at the time the "spy notes" were
avlegedly lost, was declared persona non grata at the same |
time.*

t

Queried concerning SHNYRYEV, RICHARDS and FELCHLIN
immediately recognized his photograph and name as one of the
general chauffeurs assigned to the Office of the Military
Attache at the Moscow Embassy; RICHARDS was taken on his
first trip outside Moscow by SHNYRYEV. He remarked that the

¥ Ambassador BOHLEN successfully insisted, against initial
Soviet refusal, that his personal plane be allowed into the

NOSENKO was asked to describe the unusual circumstances
under which FELCHLIN left. NOSENKO said he could not, in-
asmuch aS he was no longer in the American Department at
the time. Told that the expulsion took place in 1954,
NOSENKO said this was not the correct date.

attaches referred to SHNYRYEV as either “Nikolay Perviy"
(Nicholes the First) or "Nikolay Vtoroy" (Nicholas the
Seconc) to distinguish him from the other chauffeur with
the same name. FELCHLIN said that SHNYRYEV drove primarily
for the Military Attache himself, but sometimes drove for
the AssiStant Military Attaches, and he remembered that i
SHNYRYEV was not well, suffered fro: war wounds, and had i
continuing chest or lung trouble. (Asked whether SHNYRYEV t
had any medical problem, NOSENKO said he was not aware of |
|

any.)

FELCHLIN said his maid Dora FEDOPOVA (not specifically
named by NOSENKO) was in her 50's. en she spoke with
FELCHLIN about a job, she asked for shout 120 rubles a month, : :
which seemed excessive, so FPELCHLIN offered 806, PFEDOROVA :
refused and left. ‘Iwo days later she returned and accepted.
She spoke little English. Otner maids came to the
door of FELCHLIN's apartment to “chat” with her, and sus-
pecting that they were reporcing to ROVA, FPELC ILEN
teased her about it. FEDOKJVA's previous employer at the
Embassy gave her full name to columnist Drew PEARSON with
a statement that she was one of the chief spies and the Iccal

-“boss" cf the Fmbassy netwo BARSOU printed the allega-

tion. In the sunmer of 1953 or 1454, according te PELCHLIN,
the maid approached FRELCHLIN with the article, waved it in
his face, and accused him of being P. N's source. (NO- ‘

SENKO did not recognize FELOROVA's name and did not recail

hearing cr reading of this incident.)

(v) BENSON {

NOSENKO identified his target Jonn S. BENSON as a
major and Assistant Army Attache in Moscow. He did not
recall the names cf any agents working against BENSON but
said that BENSON was with MULE and STROUD (see below) in
Stalingrad in 1955 when ali three were caught by the KGE
with electronic “spying" devices, They were declared per-
sona non grata. The KGB had no other derogatory information

on BENSON from any cther source.

(vi) STROUD

arene ae

NOSENKO identified William R. STROUD as a captain and an
Assistant Army Attache. The only agents working against him
were the Military Attaches' drivers. From concealed micro-
phones, the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned before
STROUD's arrival in Moscow that he was an expert in the use of

. electronic spying apparatus. He wus with BENSON and MULE
in Stalingrad and was declared persona non grata along with
them (see below). Other than this, NOSENKO said, the KGB
knew nothing unusual or interesting about STROUD from any
source.

CIA files show that STROUD was, with BENSON and MULE,
the victim of the Soviets' seizure of technical equipment
in Stalingrad and was declared perscna non grata on 7 May
, 1955. On 31 January 1955 he travelled to Kharkov from Mos~
cow with First Secretary Frank SISCOE to interview an Ameri-
can defector living there. (According to NOSENKO, SISCOE
, “was suspected by the KGB of being a CIA officer; SISCOE was,
. . dn fact, a CIA cooptee.)

(vii) MULE

NOSENKO identified Walter MULE as an Assistant Army

Attache and said that he was the case officer responsible
for him. NOSENKO described an operational approach to MULE,
in which he himself participated: In 1953 or 1954 there
had been several defection 2pproaches to Soviets in the
United States on the basis of money and the promise of a
new life. After the KGB Second Chief Directorate decided to
try the same measures, MULE was selected because he was only
a captain despite his lengthy service in the Army and because
material from concealed microphones indicated that he was
often disparaged by the other attaches. When MULE received
letters from home, he threw them in the trash, and the
maids turned these over to the KGB, from this mail it was
understood that MULE did not have a house in -the United
States but lived with his family in a trailer. The father
of two children, MULE had sent his wife from Moscow to Ger-
meny for en abortion, as a third child would have imposed
too great an economic burden. On the basis of all this the
KGB appointed N,st. BURODIN, a recruiter of the American De-
partment, to attempt to defect MULE. Together th BORODIN,
KOVSHUK, and L.A. LEBEDEV (from the Second Chier Directorate's
special technical section) NOSENKO travelled to Leningrad
for the operation. LEBEDEV installed a ciock containing a
concealed camera as well as microphones in MULE's hotel
room, and BORODIN entered the room to await MULE'’s return.
When MULE started to enter the room, he caught sight of
BORODIN and tried to back out, but NoeeNse and KOVSHUK
closed the door fxOm the hall ap

him a job as a "consultant." BORODIN had either $5,000 or
$10,C00 in an envelope to encourage MULE to accept. Ac-
cording to NOSENKO, MULE refused outright, telling BORODIN
to get out, that he would not talk to him, and that he was
® captain in the American Army.

CIA files show that MULE reported this incident. He
said that he was locked in his hotel room and subjected to
a recruitment attempt by an MVD agent calling himself Jack
SIEGAL, who offered nim 310,000 for "work" on a long-range
basis., SIEGAL emphasized that MULE would not be required
to procure documents from the Embassy, and according to
MULE, SIPGAL was aware of facts concerning MULE's personal
life that could have been obtained only from listening de-
vices in MULE's apartment or office. SIEGAL left after about
20 minutes, having warned MULE not to report the incident.
CULE was unable to identify NOSENKO's photograph.

declared persona. non grata. KOSENKO gave the following
account of this inéldent: For some time the Second Chief

Directorate had been trying to acquire a small, convenient
officers vere known to be using during their travels inside |
the Sovict Union. As early as the beginning of 1954, the *
American Department had been given authorization from the
Central Cozrittee of the Communist Party to stenl tais
equipment from the Americans, provided that the success of”
such an operation way assured. Before his transfer to the". -
Tourist Department in 1955, NOSENKO hinself had helped to
develop plans for the operation and had even arranged an

a railroad station outside Moscow. While BENSON, MULE,

and STROUD were on one of their trips (afrer NOSENKO's tran3-
fer) it was learned that they had the equipment with them,
and the KCB decided to take it from them in Stalingrad.

To carry out the operation, Lieutenant General P.V. FRDOTOV,
then Chief of the KGB Sccond Chief Directorate, end AM.
GORBATENKO, Chier of the American Departnent, flew with
other personnel from the American Department to Stalingrad.
The hotel rooms of BENSON, STROUD and NULE were watched
constantly from a visual observation post, and it. vas noted
that they never ato in the hotel restaurant but always in
their rooms. It was also noted that the spparatus was .
placed under a pillow before they began to cat. While they
were seated at the table having dinner, therefore, the KGB
officers suddenly entered the room and seized the equipment.
in order to partially cover the illegality of this act, it

STROUD from the Soviet Union, and this was done via the
persona non grata action.

According to information from other sources, the equip-
ment was seized from BENSON, MULE, and STROUD on 5 May 1955,
and the three were declared persona non grata on 7 May (a
month before NOSENKO ciained to have transferred to the
Tourist Department).* When the 7 May date was given to
NOSENKO during the February 1965 interrogations, he replied
that the operation was handled at a higher level, that he
did not directly participate in it, but that he had been
involved in the earlier planning to seize the equipment. _ }
It was pointed out to him that he had always said he was in
the Tourist Department at the time of this operation, and
that he had consistently said that he transferred from the
American to the Tourist Department in June 1955. _NOSENKO _
shrugged, but offered no comment. . os H

(ix) CARDELLA

‘ NOSENKO' said that in 1954 and 1955 there was an admini-
strative officer in the Embassy by the name of James CARDELLA.
The KGB had no interesting or unusual information concerning
CARDELLA from any source, and NOSENKO could say nothing more
about hin. oo

CIA files show that Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA served
in Moscow from September 1953 until June 1955. Other than the
fact that a microghone was discovered in CARDELLA's Moscow Em-
bassy office in 1964, no significant collateral information
ecncerning him is available.

(x) VAN LARTHEM

NOSENKO identified George VAN LASTHEM as an Assistant Air.
Attache at the U.S. Embassy against om an operation was at-
tempted in 1953 or 1954. He said that during this period a.
Russian actress, Alla LARIONOVA, was placed on a train going
from Berlin to Moscow with the mission of striking up an acquain-
tance with VAN LAETHEM which could be followed up in Moscow.

She succeeded in meeting him and gave him her address: and tele-
phone: number. Although she was certain that she would hear from
him, he ‘never did cali her in Moscow. NOSENKO said that he had :
heard about this from P.F. PANKRATCY, the case officer handling i
LARIONOYA. He added that CHURANOV was the case officer respon- i
sible for VAN LAETHEM, as he was for all members of the Air At-

tache's office at that time. NOSENKO knew of no other interest

or activity concerning VAN LAETHEM.

D. June 1955 to January 1960 (Tourist Department)

1. Introduction |

By his account’ NOSENKO served in the Amer ican-Canadian-:
British Section of the Tourist Department,* KGB Second Chief
Directorate, from June 1955 (shortly after, the department

in the USSR) until his transfer to another department in
that directorate in January 1960. He was.a case officer
until appointed Deputy Chief of the Section about June 1958.
In statezents made prior to April 1966, NOSENKO claimes to
have been twice promoted during this four and one-half year
period--to captain in July 1956 and to major in August or
September 1959--but in a signed statement of April 1966 he .
said he remained a captain from 1956 until his defection. : i

.NOSENKO has described his personal and: direct partici-
Pation in the section's activities as consisting of:.

~Recruitment of two Soviet. nationals as homosexual
agents,** with NOSENKO their handler from the outset until
they were dropped in 1962 or 1963.

Ban Lalani or

-Recruitment and handling of Soviets as agents tar-—
getted against American tourists; their number varied from
eight to 14 and many were employed by Inturist.

-Operations involving :4 foreigners who visited the
USSR for various lengths of time.

-Recruitment and handling of the American Express Com-
pany representative in Moscow, whom NOSENKO continued to
meet following his reassignment in January 1960.

-Decision in October 1959 that Lee Harvey OSWALD was
of no operational interest to the KGB, and subsequent par- an
ticipation in the KGB investigation of OSWALD's activities
in the USSR. .

Each of these categories is discussed separately below.

, Because he had been seen meeting a foreigner in a
public lavatory in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded ;
that A.I. VOLKOV might be a homosexual and hence of some ne
operational value. The KGB therefore mounted an operation .
which verified this possibility in 1987:. A homosexual agent .
of the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department provoked Loe
VOLKOV into a compromising ‘situation... Then VOLKOV, who had |
previously been a KGB agent but was at this time deactivated; ©
was called to KGB Headquarters where, after NOSENKO interro-
gated him, he admitted his homosexuality and agreed to :

*These components are also known as the First’ Section: and

NOSENKO's proposal to work for the KGB among homosexuals.
VOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year. to-recruit a hoxo~_
sexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronymic not recalled). o
YEFREMOV. The two agents subsequently worked as a team
against foreigners under NOSENKO's direction; in addition
.to specific targets, they had the general assignment of
associating with foreign visitors in Moscow for the pur-
pose of spotting possible homosexuals. NOSENKO described
on 12 June 1962 his use of these agents: "Although I am

a chief of section there 1 have all sorts of.agents. I
have a good agent apparatus. I have beautiful girls,
beautiful girls, whom I can use as I like--anything you
want. I have homosexuals, pederasts, and, in particular, I
have one special pair. I am afraid they are known to both
you and the British. I permitted this pair to work in

general [without specific assignments]. TI send them out to. -

look on their own. I give them money and tell them to go
out. ‘Stroll about. Here are theater tickets. “Look around,
but only Americans. Look for American pederasts.' They are
& couple, that is, they love each other. They are able to
do anything desired, cither active or passive, anything.
They call me at night: ‘Yuriy Ivanovich. There is a mister
so-and-so here. He wants to go to bed with us.'' I say:
““Well, let him. We'll talk about it tomorrow.' So the next
day they go to a special hotel room. Wo make photographs.
Then we think about what he represents. Is he worth it?
Then, as Chief, I recommend that he be recruited or not--
depending on his position, what he can give, what he can
tell. If he can give something, I say: ‘Well, let's have

a go figrat'|. After this, I speak to these boys: ‘Well,
go to bed with him again, one or both of you, as you wish.
Do whatever is wanted.' All this is seen [observed by the
KGB]. The [hotel] administrator enters. ‘What are you
doing?' The administrator calls the Militia. An akt is
drawn up. ‘Well, you are a foreigner. This is not our
business. We don't know what to do with you.' Then the
Chief arrives: ‘What's up. Aha, I sce.' Well, then a con-
versation begins: ‘Listen, what shall we do? Pederasty is
punishable by three to five years and now, on the basis of
recent legislation, by up to eight. Understand, if your
friends find out that you are a pederast--and how can they
help but find out?..."

When NOSENKO moved from the Tourist Department to the
Second Chief Directorate's American Department in January
1960, he took VOLKOV and YEFRENOV with him. They were

never used against targets in the U.S. Embassy; but, NOSENKO’

said, the Tourist Department “used to call me on homosexual
prospects." VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued as active KGB
agents until some time in 1960 or 1961, after which they
could not be used further since they had become too well
known, and NOSENKO finally retired their files to KGB
archives in 1962 or 1963. The last operation in which these

two agents participated was. during January 1962.

During interrogation on these agents, NOSENKO has been

unable to tell where they lived in Moscow, their family

situation, or other such details. He said that he. never
met either in a safehouse (always on the street) and never
met either of them alone, without the other being present..

The Tourist Department, just established when NOSENKO
was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent network for
operations against American and British tourists. Conse-
quently, NOSENKO said, he and the other case officers had
to “start from the beginning." e

As a first step, NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow
officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist; these
were not agents, he explained, but "just persons Known to
the KGB so that a KGB man could approach one of them with
questions about somebody or something."' NOSENKO began to
collect information on these individuals and others with the
aim of formalizing their recruitment; by the end of 1955,
he estimated, he had a network of about eight agents, all
of then Inturist interpreters. During the following four
years, the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied:

4, Operations with Forcign Visitors : ‘

NOSENKO said he participated in 14 operations with |
foreign visitors to the USSR while a member of the American i
Canadian Section of. the Tourist Department. Nine of these :
operations resulted in recruitmenis {excluding one who later |
was recruited by another element of the KGB, but including
another whom NOSENKO classified as a borderline case). of
the remaining five operations which did not end with a re-

case, one target rejected NOSENKO's proposal, the KGB was
unable to obtain compromising material for an approach to a
third, and for political reasons the KGB decided against
approaching the final two.

pacha! SRAM seulyee pat oh ln ts

Although the information from NOSENKO on the timing of
these operations does not always agree with that from other
sources, these cases can be grouped chronologically as ,
follows: 1955 ~— one; 1956 ~ one; 1957 - three; 1958 - two; ‘
and 1959 - seven. The operations in 1955, 1956 and, with
one exception, 1959 were homosexual provocations. The re-
cruitment of Arsene FRIPPEL in 1959 was based on heterosexual
compromise.

These fourteen operations are summarized briefly below
in the approximate order in which the cases began. For
each case, NOSENKO's information is followed by a summary of
the results of CIA investigations. The description of the
BURGI case is more detailed than the others, for reasons in-

a.- Attempted Entrapment of MALIA (1955)

spent about four months in the USSR in 1955 and was sus~
pected of having connections with American Intelligence.

be a homosexual. The Soviet was detained by the KGB, and
NOSENKO eventually obtained a. confession that he had had .
homosexual relations, with MALIA. After. NOSENKO, had arranged |
° KGB homosexual agent, —
the latter enticed MALIA to a specially equipped hotel room
in Moscow; NOSENKO was on the scene (but not directly in
ouch with MALIA) when the introductions were made in a

14-00000

Moscow restaurant, and from an observation point in a
neigtboring hotel rooa he watched the KGB agent and MALIA
having relaticns. With MALIA insisting on the lights being
turned off, however, .1t was impossible to obtain compro-
mising photcgraphs (the KGB did not yet have infra-red
photographic equipmont, NOSENKO said) and therefore no re-
cruitment approach was made to MALIA. During this and a
later trip to Moscow. in 1961, MALIA was "very cautious,"
and the KGB never again succeeded in exploiting MALIA's
homosexuality for a recruitment approach.

Investigation Results: MALIA, a U.S. Navy intelligence
officer during World War. 11, has visited the Soviet Union
in 1955 and twice tn 1962. While buying books for the
Library of Congress and.several universitics in 1955, MALIA |
travelled over 10,000 miles throughout the USSR, which was
sufficiently unusual at the time to attract press publicity.
in 1955 and 1962 he nad contacts with dissident Soviet
citizens and clandestinely brought to the West literature
for publishing abrord. In December 1963 MALIA was the
subject of an attack in the Soviet press which charged that
during 1862 he had "spent his time in Moscow looking for
dissension in the ranks of young intellectuals at drunken
debaucnhes." MALIA lad been in periodic contact with CIA
in recent years; in the spring of 1963 he claimed to have
had'no involvements with blackmarketeers, hor.osexuals, or |
females tuside the Soviet Union at any time. ile made a
Binilar statement to REP Re in October 1963. MALIA has - |
not been interviewed in connection with NOSENKO's informa- k
tion about him.

b. Recruitment of BURGI (1956)

NOSENKO's Information: At the first meeting in 1962
and despite his stated fear for his own security and his
determination to discuss only the two leads he wished to sell
CIA, NOSENKO described his recruitment of Yate Professor
Richard BURGI on the basis of a homosexual provecation oper-
ation which began in Moscow and culminated with an approach
in Kiev in June 1956. NOSENKO reported that he received a
detter of commendation (blagodarnost') and a bonus of one
month's pay for this recruitment, but in 1966 he retracted
this claim. The BURGI case was the first operation in which
NOSENKO had direct contact with a foreign target of the KGB,
and NOSENKO said he counted it as a turning point in his

‘ personal and professional life: It was with this success-~

ful operation, NOSENKO stated, that he "began to grow" from
& spoiled’ playboy into a responsible and effective counter-=
intelligence officer. The RURGI operation was the first
recruitment carried out by the Tourist Department after it
was created in 1955, according to NOSENKO. In 1964 NOSENKO
reported for the first time that his superior, A.S. KOZLOV,
Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, had also taken part
in this operation, but that he, NOSENKO, was .the ‘responsible .
case officer. In August 1965, when asked who. had recruited
BURGI, NOSENKO’ replied: "KOZLOV and NOSENKO." Asked who
recruited him first, NOSENKO said: "KOZLOY, naturally, He
was the Deputy Chief of the Department.- The collection of

os the materials [in preparation for the approach] was in the

hands of Ease Officer NOSENKO." Because of the personal and
general significance ascribed to this operation by NOSENKO,
it is discussed in detail here: . : : :

14-00000

‘TL.

In August 1965 NOSENKO reported that at the time of
BURGI's arrival in the USSR, his file contained a copy of
his visa application (anketa), "maybe" an excerpt from a
cable sent by the Soviet Enbassy in the United States saying
that a visa had been granted, 2 routine note from Inturist
giving BURGI's anticipated date of arrival and his”itinerary
inside the Soviet Union, and the results of traces of the
general KGB Archives and of the First Chief Directorate
Archives. NOSENKO himself ran the traces, which proved to
be negative; there was no information on record concerning
BURGI, and since no other names were mentioned in the
material available on BURGI, no other traces were made. The
XGB interest in BURGI derived exclusively from the fact that
he was a professor of Slavic studies and therefvre had con-
tact with students who might some day work for the U.S.
State Department, ican Intelligence, and other target
organizations, NOSENKO did not recail who first suggested
ap attempt to recruit him. .

When BURGI arrived in the Soviet Union, he came in
contact with a number of kGB agents, and their reports were
placed in the unofficial file maintained by NOSENKO.* NO.
SENXO could not recall in 1965 how many such agents there may
have been, their names, or what they might have reported
concerning BURGI. (BURGE had en Inturist interpreter but
MOSENKO did not know whether he was @ KGB agent.) From some
source, name forgotten by NOSENKO, the KGB obtained indica-
tions that BURGI was a homosexual, and it was decided to
try to obtain the grounds for recruitment by homosexual conm-
promise. NOSENKO therefore approached Yu.A. LOPUKHOV, an
officer of the Britis: Department who handled the homosexual
agent Viktor BELANOYSKIY, and asked permission to use his
agent in setting up the compromise. After permission had
been received to mount an operation on this basis, LOPUKHOV
znd NOSENKO met with BELANOVSKIY and instructed him to rake
BURGI's acquaintance in a hotel dining room. The compromise
proceeded according to plan: BELANOVSKIY met BURGI, the
fact of mutual homosexuality was recognized, and BURGI was
invited to BELANOVSKIY's hotel room where homosexual acts
took place and photographs were made. NOSENKO was in the
adjoining room and dirceted the compromise. He did not meet
BURGI at this point, hovever,

As the result of NOSENKO's special request, the com-
promising photographs were ready by the following day. A
report of the compromise and a request for permission to

‘ attempt recruitment were then submitted to NOSENKO's superiors.

The request came back with the approving signatures of O.M.
GRIBANOV and A.S, FEKLISOV, the Chief of the American Depart-
ment of the First Chief Directorate, which had expressed
interest in using BURGI in the United States. BURGI's itin-
erary called for him to fly from Moscow to Kiev a short

while after this episode and, having called the Kiev KGB with
instructions, NOSENKO and KOZLOV flew there the day before to
prepare the operation. BURGI arrived the next morning and
was met at the airport by (fnu) KHODAKOVSKIY, an officer of
the Second Directorate in Kiev who operated under Inturist

cover. NOSENKO was unable to recall how the car was ac-
quired, whether it was a KGB or Iniurist vehicle, who the
driver was, whether he was in the employ of the local KGB,

or other details.

In accordance with the operations] plan, the local KGB
officer told BURGI enroute to the city that all the hotels
in Kiev were full at the moment because of various confer-_
ences, but that Inturist had arranged for him to stay for
about a day in a privaté apartment in the center of town;
he would be moved to a hotel as soon as possible. When the
ear arrived at the apartment building on Kreshchatik Ulitsa

in Kiev, NOSENKO, KOZLOV, V.S. PETRENEKO, a local KGB officer,
and (fnu) KASTYKAITE, a woman housekeeper, were waiting for
them. NOSENKO could not remember how or whether he intro-
duced himself to BURGI. The recrnitment conversation, he
said, was handled by "“KOZLOV-NOSELKO,' but NOSENKO had for-
gotten by 1965 who said what: "I don't remember what I
talked about and I don't remember what KOZLOV talked about.
Many things were discussed. I[t started with how he Liked
his stay in:the Soviet Union... Then we slowly proceeded

to say how unfortunate it was that information had been re- :
ceived about his conduct in Moscow. We told him that his

homosexual activities were known, that this was punishable

under Soviet law according to article.so-and-~so of the

eriminal code, etc., that he was not a diplomat, had no : 1
diplomatic immunity, that he could be taken to court ac-

cording to the Soviet law... Well, he was scared, confused,

upset, and felt uncomfortable. Then we slowly proceeded to

say that all that could be smoothed out, but, you understand,

the basis was prepared for the man to say: ‘All right, I |

|

cata sitet Lisdnidbatai nue

i

agree to help.'... We showed him the pictures. He was

embarrassed of course-~he was naked. Then we prepared the

basis: ‘you have a noble task. You teach; you have stu-

dents; the students might become future specialists on

Russia or might work as diplomats, etc., but many of these

students could be used by intelligence. They might be sent '

somewhere with special tasks. Maybe you will tell us who |

I

among the students is preparing for government service,

how they are distributed, etc.’... During the first conver-
sation everything was made completely clear... He was not
at ali willing to help or work for Soviet Intelligence. He
was told that he must understand that in this case ‘helping
Soviet Intelligence' was a very broad term. I remember that
I told him: ‘Understand, nobody is going to ask you that }
you help our friends over there, or me, if I stould be there,

or that you do anything bad or conduct any kind of subver-

sive activities, that you organize explosions or murder.'

After the Soviet Union, he was supposed to go to Italy,

to visit the Russicum of the Vatican, and here KOZLOV

grabbed the subject and began to ask questions about this

school. He told us a bit about the Russicum and we asked

him to write about it and he wrote down some names of the

professors who teach Russian subjects..." According to

NOSENKO, the discussion lasted about five hours; at its end. .
BURGI signed a short statement that he agreed "to assist

the organs of Soviet Intelligence." NOSENKO first said that

it was he who took this statement from BURGI but later said

he could not remember whether he or KOZLOV did this. BURGI

was then taken to a hotel.

This was the first time NOSENZO met BURGI. Following
the recruitment, he moved into the same hotel, a floor
above BURGI, and for the remainder of BUNGI's stay in Kiev
became his constant companion and guide. An attempt sas
made"to snooth out all the dirty business that had teen
brought up during the recruitment talk." NOSENKO took
BURGI to an old cathedral in Kiev; with KOZLOV and PETRENKO
they visited a koltkhoz and the writer SHEVCHENKO*s grave in
nearby Kaniv, The Subject of homosexuality * not raised
again. From Kiev, BURGI went directly to the West, withcut
returning to Moscow. Before the approach, NOSENKO had
visited the American Department of the First Chief D4recto-
rate and had arranged with its chief, VEKLISOV, for 2 ree
contact plan in Mew York City should RBURGI be reeruited.
Before he left BURGE was: briefed on th > arranyements,

second or third time BURG] appeared and the New York Legel
Residency continued to moet with him until the Revolution -in
Hungary in late 1956. NOSENKO later heard from someone in
the American Department, First Chief Directorate that the
case was closed. For their roles in this first recruitment
ef the Tourist Department, NOSENKO said in 1965, he ana
KOZLOV received letters of commencation and oonuses of one
month's pay by order of KGB Chairman SEROV: PETRENKO was
given a letter of commendation and half a month's salary;
and even RASTYKAITE, the housekeeper, got a commendation,

In Octcber 1966, however, NOSENKO said his only KGB award
was for his longevity of service.

Note: There is a simi
ticn of the ban on recruitment approaches in 1959, which
prevented the Tourist t fron taking advantage

of its compromising p Lography of BARFETY and WILLER=
FORD, and information provided by the earlier defector,
GOLITSYN. GOLITSYN reported chat én American exployed

at the U.S. Embassy in Moscew, possibly a code clerk, was
prepared for recruitment on the basis of homosexual com-
“premise during 1959 and 1960. According to information

he said he iearned from U.s. Embassy Section case offi-
cer, G.I. GRYAZNOV, the KGB had chotegraphs of the
American in various stages of a homosexual act, and

there was no questicn about the recruitment being achieved:
"The only question was to where," At the time, however,
SHELEPIN had just become Chairman of the KGB and was‘ .
stressing ideologica! rather than blackmail recruitments.
He was shown these particular shetograrhs but decided that
‘an approach on their basis would be too crude and that
another way should be found. Although SHELEPIN did not
exclude the use of these photographs some time in the
future, according to GOLLTSYN, he had reservations against
using them at that time for fear of the propaganda reper-:
cussions if the attempt should fail and be exposed pub-
licly. GOLITSYN did not know whether the recruitment was
subsequently carried out. The essential differences. be-
. tween this account and that of NOSENKO are that GOLITSYN
implied the tan was in effect at least into 1960 and that.
GOLITSYN appeared to be speaking of a general prohibition, |

also did a gcod and intelligent job of establishing relations
with Inturist. He had very good relationships with ANXULINOV,
the Chairman of Inturist, and with other pcopie, both the chiefs
and the low-level workers... But, why was FRIPPEL recruited?
_I was interested in knowing precisely Ly whem, by name, and how

ae He replied that the KGB had already had great success in this
‘ by other means and launched into 3 long description of the .

NOSENKO was present in the adjoining room when FRIPPEL was
compromised by a Soviet female agent, Klara Konstantinovna
_GORBACHEVA. NOSENKO described the compromising scene in detail.
‘as well as the attempt by a KGB technician to take motion pic-
tures of these activities through a two-way mirror, and the
confrontation with the militiamen who broke into the room.

; Embassy Section. — : .

™ 130.

After returning to Geneva in 1964 and during subsequent:

debriefings and interrogations, NOSENKO made the following

./ additional statemehts concerning the FRIPPEL case:

~. Although he had personally recruited FRIPPEL, he
did not do so’#lone; Col. V.0. CHELNOKOY, Deputy Chief
(and later Chief) of the Tourist Cepartment, was present;
he and NCSENKO “carried out the récruitrent together” in
early September’:1959. NOSENKO was, however, FRIPPEL's
case officer. .-- :

- NOSENKO attricuted his involvement..in the FRIPPEL
recruitment to the following: "In 1952, after 1958,
when I became the Deputy Chief of the section, my area
of activity was narrowed down. I didn't handle all the
tourists at that time. I worked as the Deputy Chief of
the section and 1 had my own little area--‘or example, the
permanent representative of the American Express Company,
and besides that I began to collect all the material on
all American tourist firms which have anytiing to do with
Inturist and who senda tourists to the USSR."

- FRIPPEL never provided any information of value to
Soviet tourist operations.

- When NOSENKO began to work in the U.S. Embassy
Section of the American Department in 1560, he took PRIPPEL
with him because FRIPPEL was acquainted with some Ameri-
cans at the Embassy. NOSENKO was asked to question FRIPPEL
about the U.S. Embassy and such Embassy officers as George
WINTERS and Lewis W. BOWDEN, but FRIPPEL never told NOSENKO
anything along this line.*

- FRIPPEL provided no interesting information during
NOSENKO's two meetings with him in 1962 and 1963, when
FRIPPEL returned to the Soviet Union as a tour guide.

- NOSENKO met “pretty steadily” with FRIPPEL during
the period to January 1961, and once NOSENKO and his wife,
in company with CHELNOKOV and his wife, had diriner at
FRIPPEL’?s home, where they met Mrs. FRIPPEL. Odette
FRIPPEL was unaware of her husband's status as a KGB agent,
and therefore NOSENKO and CHELNOKOV used Inturist cover
for their acquaintance with FRIPPEL. Although unusual for
KGB Secone Chief Directorate case officers to visit agents
in their homes with wives present, NOSENKO explained that
he went because he "was invited," and CHELNOKOV went "be-
cause he was also involved in the recruitment."

- First as Deputy Chief of a section of the Tourist
Department and later as Deputy Chief and Acting Chief of
the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department,
NOSENKO continued to meet with FRIPPEL in Moscow hotels
and restaurants. Throughout this périod, he was almost’.
invariably accompanied by CHELNOKOV: “Perhaps one time
I met with FRIPPEL alone, otherwise it was always with

at

» CHELNOKOV." Usually NOSENKO would arrange these meetings
with FRIPPEL at CHELNOXOV's request and the two continued
to meet with FRIPPEL, despite his lack of production, be-
cause they "kept hoping he would give something.” Ina
different context, but speaking of CHELNOKOV, NOSENKO ex-
plained: “You see, never-mind if you are a chief ora
@Geputy chief of a department, you must havé one, two, or
three agents. GRIBANOV insists, so that you don't forget
how to work. The Chiefs of the [Second Chief] Director-
ate do not demand that they have 12 or 13 agents, but they

~ : must -have two or three. They will have important agents
or those in leading positions."

- NOSENKO continued to act as FRI#PEL's case officer
after FRIPPEL had left the Soviet Union and NOSENXO had a :
been transferred and promoted to the position of Deputy . :
Chief of the Tourist Department. He met twice with FRIP- — : er
PEL during this latter period when FRIPPEL visited the i :
Soviet Union as a guide with groups of foréign visitors.
Both of these meétings were handled by NOSENKO alone, with
out CHELNOKOV. ,

- The first meeting took place in the summer of 1962,
after NOSENKO had returned to Moscow from Geneva. FRIPPEL
had arrived in the Soviet Union as a guide for some Ameri- ‘
can journalists. (NOSENKO was unable to give the compo- — i
sition of the journalist group or to recall where they
stayed in Moscow and where else they ‘travelled in the Sov-

- iet Union.) NOSENKO contacted him in Moscow to learn what :

. questions the newsmen intended to ask KHRUSHCHEV during 7
a scheduled ‘interview; subsequently NOSENKO acknowledged i
that standard practice required visiting journalists to sd
submit their intended questions for KHRUSHCHEV in writing
to Soviet authorities prior to interviews. After the

we interview, he recontacted FRIPPEL to learn the reaction.
of the journalists to their talk with the Soviet leader.
NOSENKO could not recall their specific reaction to the
KHRUSHCHEV interview but did remember that they were :
“satisfied,” Another reason for contacting FRIPPEL, :
NOSENKO added in a later discussion, as to learn whether .
any of the journalists might hive joined the group at the
last moment in the United States, which might suggest
intelligence connections on their part.*

~ NOSENKO met. FRIPPEL alone for the second and last
time during March 1963. Since FRIPPEL was a guide for
tourists aboard the ship "Olympia," which stopped for a
day in Yalta and Cdessa, NOSENKO flew to Odessa from Mos- : tee.

from his group, FRIPPEL called on NOSENKO in the latter's =
hotel zoom, and the two drank and talked. NOSENKO had | .
given FRIPPEL a bottle of vodka as a gift, and FRIPPEL
Baid he wanted to give NOSENKO some whiskey in return.

They drove in NOSENKO'S car to the port, where NOSENKO
waited in the car while FRIPPEi, went aboard for the
whiskey. (He had invited NOSENKO to visit the ship but
could not obtain a pass for hin.) When FRIPPEL returned.
he brought another American, so NUSENKO had to invent for
himself a suitable cover (Inturist) on the spot. ‘The three
returned te the hctel and Granz some more, everyone getting
_drunk. During this contact, FRIPPEL reported "nothing of
importance," and his most interesting news was that he
might again ue reassigned to Moscow in December 1963 as

the Americen Express Company representative. *

6. Lee Harvey OSWALD (1959-60 and 1963).

As in the FRIPPEL case, NOSENKO was’.involved with Lee
Harvey OSWALD during both periods of his ‘assignment to the
Tourist Department of the Second Chief Directorate (1955-
1960 and 1962-1964).* While Deputy Chief Of the American-
British-Canadian Tourist Section, NOSENKO had a direct hind
in the decision in October 1959 that GSWALD was of no oper- : ms
ational interest to the KGB And should be returned immediately
to the United States. Before President Kennedy's assassi- .
nation in November 1963, when NOSENKU was again in the
Tourist Department as its Deputy. Chief, he was present. at the
time the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned of OSWALD's -
application to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to re-enter.
the USSR, After the assassination, he also played a role in
the KGB investigations of OSWALD's activities during residence
in the Soviet Union from October 1959 untii June 19u2.

Collateral information relating to OSWALD's stay in the
Soviet Union, and particularly concerning any connections he
may have had with Soviet intelligence, is meager and indirect.
It derives almost entirely from indications cf primary
interest by the KGB (among all Soviet Government organs) in
every defector to the USSR, and from inferences which may be : i
drawn from certain entries in OSWALD's "Historical Diary" and ;
certain statements made by his wife, Marina, during inter- — ‘ i
views on behalf of the Warren Commission. After President ; ;
Kennedy's death, the Soviet Government provided the United
States with official documents and letters pertaining to
OSWALD's defection to the USSR, his suicide attempt, his
marriage, and other events inside the Soviet Union, This
information from the Soviet Government generally agrees with
the information from NOSENKO. The materials furnished by
the Soviet Government make no_mention o’ any Soviet Inte).-

- ligence interest, or lack thereof, in OSWALD.

partment Chief, K.N. DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head-
quarters from the KGB legal. Residency in Mexico. The cable,

permission to return to the USSR and that he had dealt with — .

Soviet Union." Surveillance of OSWALU was not increased

b. Statements to CIA

On the basis cf the FBI interviews of NOSENKO and the
similar information which he had previously provided CIA,
further debricfings were conducted by CIA on 3 and 27. July

debriefings is presented below.

(i) KGB Interest _in OSWALD ;
Until CSWALD mentioned to the Inturist guide his desire

to remain in the Sovict Union, he was treated routinely by

the KCB. When OSWALD azde his request, this was reported

imaediately to the Tourist Department, and it was from this

moment that the KGB began to pay attention to him, All

available materials on him were thereupon collected and

examined--the visa application, Inturist reports, interpreters’

reports, reports fro hotel agents, and the results of &

check of KGB Archives. KRUPNOV interviewed the interpreter

to whom OSWALD had stated his desire. Although the KGB con-

sidered it possible that OSWALD might be an American agent,

the KGB did nothing to investigate this possibility as “this

would be done after the person is allowed to stay in the

after his request, and OSWALD was not inte:viewed by the

KGB in an attempt to establish his intentions. There was

no attempt to debrief OSWALD because “he was not an inter-
esting person and-wasn't normal." OSWALD was never questioned *
on his past nor asked to write an autobicgraphy.** From the

T-ROSERKO provided details on this point to CIA (see pelow) and
made a similar statement when asked in 1964 why KGB agent .
Tamara KUNGAROVA had been permitted to marry an American (her own
developmental target) and then emigrate to England; See Part V.D.5.
®& When he appeared at the U.S. Embassy to renounce his citizen-.
ship on 31 October 1959, OSWALD told the counsellor officer that
he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and had told a
Soviet official that he would give the Soviets any information
concerning the-Marines and radar which he possessed. :

KGB therefore had Inturist tell him that he would have to -

attempt supported the Tourist Department's feelirg that
it had been right in deciding to refuse OSWALD's request
for citizenship, particularly as the hospital also re-

ported that he was not normal, and the Tourist Department .- ~ : . |.
decided: "We will do nothing; we don't want to know him." -: : . .

Inturist was suvsequently told: "'There is no KGB interest

In him, Do. what you want'... The KGB thought that he was .
of no interest for the country or for the KGB, that he was. '
not normal, and that he should leave the country." The : |
Tourist Department and the KGB in general thereupon "washed

their hands" of this matter, Dl

there anything in OSwALD's file to indicate that the KGB

attempted to debrief him on his past service in the U.S.

Marine Corps or other matters; this was because "he is a

very little person and also it is felt that he is not nor-

mal, so the KGB is afraid to do this with him."* The GRU

was not informed of OSNALD's defection, Neither was any

attempt made to exploit OSWALD for propaganda purposes

in Moscow or in Minsk. In short, there was no intelligence

interest or contact with OSWALD after the initial assess- - 4
ha ‘

t

There was never any operational use of OSWALD nor was a : |

ment of abnormality.

(ii) KGB Interest _in Marina OSWALD ——.

The KGB had no knowledge or interest in Marina (nee
PRUSAKOVA) until she and OSWALD applied for permission to
register marriage. In fact the KGB did not know that she
was a friend of OSWALD until this point, for there was no
surveillance on OSWALD to show that he knew her. When the
KGB learned of their relationship, checks were made of the
Archives of the Minsk KGB as well as neighborhood checks and
checks at her place of employment. The people where she
lived and worked and went to school considered her a simple
girl, not very clever, only fair in her studies, not an active
member of the KOMSOMOL, She was a simple "philistine," an }
uncultured girl more interested in gossip than in anything

ceded Wihiaicee Bete

informant on.OSWALD "because it was considered dangerous to
recruit a wife to report on her husband," Nor was it con-

sidered to recruit her for use after she arrived in the

United States, "because she would tell him and also. she ,

of the type of person she was."

| NOSENKO was asked why there were so few difficulties
in the way of Marina's marriage to a foreigner and her
departure from the Soviet Union. lie replied: “"The Soviet
law allows any Soviet citizen to marry a foreigner. It was

¥"NOSENKO ‘subsequently dafined this Kcr reservation about co

“easy in this case because OSWALD was already living and. - -
working in the Soviet Union. “It would be sore difficult, —
of course, with tourists or others who are in the Soviet

‘Union only for a short period: and want to. marry Soviet

» citizens,"* “Asked whether it. is not unusually difficult

' for Soviet citizens to leave the Soviet Union, NOSENKO
- explained: "In this. case it was easier because Marina

was already married to a foréigner.".. NOSEXXO was fext :

asked what Office or level of the Government or Party ,

“must make the final decision Yegarding Marina's marriage :

to OSKALD. He described the procedure as follows: "They

would come to the Regional Registration Office to apply

to register their marriage, [There] they will be told

that they will have to wait a week or two while they think

it over to be sure they want to get married, During this

period the necessary checks are Conducted, The Regional: H
Office would call the Militia, and the Militia would call
the Minsk KGB, The Minsk KGB said that it is all right
for them to get married--that the KGB has no objection.
But it is the law that allows them to be married. There
are no formal approvals necessary," — .

wu

a hihi twinair

Concerning the decision to permit the couple to leave . 5
the USSR, NOSENKO said on 3 July 1964 that the decision : :
would be made cn the local level, in Minsk, and that there i :
is no need to check in Moscow. On 27 July 1964 he corrected '
this statement to say that, while local authorities make :

(iv) OSWALD's Visit to Soviet Enbassy in Mexico

Asked whether he had any information oa OSWALD's visit
to ‘':xico-in September 1963, NOSENKO. said that he knew oniy
that OSWALD had applied at the Soviet Embassy there to come |
to the Soviet Union. The Mexico €ity Legal Residency of the
KGB reported his visit to Headquarters by cable, requesting
inforr:*ion; this was the first that the KGB First Chief
Directorate had heard of CSWALD. M.1. TURALIN, Deputy Chief
of Service Number Two (KGB counterintelligence abroad),
thereupon phoned V.K. ALEKSEYEV, Chief of the Sixth Section
of the Tourist Department, whom TURALIN knew personally, to
‘learn whether any information was available. NOSENKO believed
that ALEKSEYEV then came to V.D. -CHELNOKOV or A.G. KOVALENKO
-to. ask about OSWALD, and NOSENKO thought that he himself was
present at the time, ALEKSEYEV was given the background on
‘ OSWALD, including his suicide attempt and the fact that he
_ “: W@S not considered normal, and was told to advise the First —_
Chief Directorate that OSWALD should not be permitted to re-
enter the Soviet Union, ALEKSEYEV then telephoned TURALIN

(v) NOSENKO's Comments on Possible KGB Involverent in the
Ssinetion

When first discussing the OSWALD case with NOSENKO on 23 t
January 1964, a CIA case officer commented: “It is a very un- {
fortunate thing that these prior events occurred in the Soviet f
Union." (NOSENKO apparently. misunderstood the case officer's . b
intent, which was not to imply that the KGB was behind the os b
assassination, ly that the fact of OSWALD's "defection" : : 5
Placed the USSR under probably untound¢d suspicion.) NOSENKO's
immediate résponse to this remark was: "That is not correct,

This is putting a false color to it, I am your friend, I am

completely with you, and I will continue to work with you and :

agcinst the Soviet Union in all respects, But the truth %

a. _ Information from NOSENKO :
In June 1958 there was a reorganization within’ the Tourist
Department of the Second Chief Directorate. The Second Section,
.which had theretofore concerned itself with operational. activity -
against foreign tourists from all countries, was broken down into

separate sections; one section dealt with tourists from the United.

States, Canada, and Great Britain, the other with tourists from
Europe, Latin America, and all other countries. NOSENKO said
that he was promoted at this time to the position of Deputy Chief ©
of the first of these new sections.

NOSENKO's involvement in at least one major case, Lee Harvey
OSWALD, stems entirely from his having held this position. It
is also on this basis that he was able to claim awareness of all
recruitments from among American tourists from mid-1958-until he
returned to the American Department at the beginning of 1960.
His knowledge about recruitments is based additionally, he- said,
on the fact that some time between May and October 1959, during
the tourist season, he was ordered by Ye. S. KIRPICHNIKOV, -
GRIBANOV's secretary, to gather facts for GRIBANOV concerning the
use of tourist cover by foreign intelligence organizations during
the period from 1955 through 1958. NOSENKO gathered this material
from earlier annual reports of the Tourist Department and by talk-
ing) with various case officers in the department.*

: “0a the basis of his general and supervisory experience in
the Tourist Department as well as his research for this paper,
NOSENKO had the following to say about Tourist Department opera-
tions prior to 1960 (taken from the protocol he signed on this
subject on 25 February 1965):

“Operations against tourists were developing slewly
during this period and very little was known by the KGB
about the use of tourism by American Intelligence at the
time I wrote the report in 1959. No agents were definitely
uncovered among American tourists during the years 1958 or
1959 and, until 1960, no tourists were ‘caught in the act'
of mailing letters, servicing deaddrops or contacting.
agents, except one whose name I remember as McGUIRE. I do

*~ Questioned on this paper in February 1965,. NOSENKO said he

did not remember whether he discussed it with GRIBANOV, nor

_ could he recall any examples of the material he included in
it, what the paper said about ‘CIA tourist operations, or what
other U.S. Intelligence ‘organizations were using tourism as
‘an operational cover in this period. He did remember,. how-
ever, that it incorporated statistical data on the growth

of foreign tourism.

we Abeta stSy tat on

not. know any details concerning t é operat ional activity.
Which led to the discovery of McGUIRE's letter mailing. *

"I know of no case in which an American tourist was
definitely uncovered as an agent of American Intelligence
and thereafter approached for recruitment by the KGB during
this period. :

. "I do not know of any such American tourists who were
CIA agents, and who were recruited by the KGB during this
period.

“In addition to M:GUIRE, the Seventh Department de-
veloped suspicions concerning a number of tourists, but
didn't learn of any specific intelligence connections.
Some were taking pictures, others were disseminating
literature. Although various operational measures were
taken agéinst them, including vyemka (covert baggage
search) end the use of KG3 agents, none of these tourists
received real operational development."

b. KGB Knowiedge from George ELAKE

During the first week of June 1959, a three-day meeting was
held in London, England, between representatives of CIA and the
British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, commonly referred to as
MI-6) on the subject of “legai-travel* intelligence operations
against the USSR. At the conclusion of this meeting there was
drawn up a 19 page document summarizing «hat had been discussed
at the meetings. This summary spelled out CIA operational doc-
trine pertaining to tourist operacions,. including agent-spotting
techniques, criteria for agent setection, agent assessment, agent
training, and tasks to be carried out by tourist agents during
the coming (1959) tourist season. It stressed CIA's reliance
on tourists for the spotting, recontacting, assessing, and
communicating with clandestine assets in the Soviet Union. A
copy of the document as weil, presumably,as other British docu-
ments relating to the joint meetings was given to George BLAKE,
who has admitted having made a photographic copy which he passed t
to the KGB. He gave the KGB this information in the summer of :
1959. :

* One Robert Alan MCGUIRE, a former. staff empioyce of CIA, .
‘travelled to the Soviet Union as a tourist during April ard~
May 1958. Although he was debriefed on his return, he had

no connection with CIA in preparation for this trip and
mailed no letters for CIA inside the USSR. While in the
Soviet Union, McGUIRE was approached on numerous occasions

by Soviets seeking blackmarket deals. American girls, and
assistance in defecting to the Americans. While en route to
Leningrad, his brief case was. overtly searched by a customs
employee, who confiscated a Radio Liberation script. McGUIRE
reported that he was compelled to sign a document which stated
that the script had been confiscated, but the reasons for the
action were left biank. NOSENKO. who has reported none of
these details, appears to have confused MCGUIRE with Edward
McGOWAN, a CIA agent who mailed a letter in Minsk in August
1958 and was detected doing so by the KGB; NOSENKO said —
MCGUIRE mailed a letter in Minsk in 1959.

¢. GOLITSYN's Tourist Document

WKnen he defected to CIA in December 1961, GOLITSYN brought
with him a top secret KGB doc t dealing with the use by
American Inteiligence of tourists fer espionaye inside the Sov- .
det Union and with EGB countermeasures.** This study relied Lf
heavily uron the two dycument slied to the KGB by BLAKE, —
and although it purports to be a study of American tourist cpera-
tions during 1460, it cites as examples many cascs which eccurred
in earlier years. In these examples, the American egents de-
tected by the GB are named their operational roles accurately
Gescribed. {As noted above O said that McGUIRE/HcGOWAN -
was the only American definitely cetermined to havea intellicence
connections prior to 1960.) Cited belew are excerpts from the
GOLITSYN document, along with additional information from CIA
recorcés and investigations. :

, ~ The document states: "MeGCWAN, Edward, bern 1935, passing
himself off as a poSt-graduate student vf Harvard University,

in Moscow, after a thoreugh check [for surveillance] sent an
espicnage letter containing secret writing. Further investiga-
tion of McGOWAN showed that he specialized for a long period of
time on Russian and Polisn questions at the Russian Researcn
Center of Harvard University, «sich is a branch of CIA. le came
to the USSR at the expense of POCKEFELLER and MORGAN, who are
financing the so-called ‘kesearch' work cn Russia.”

WUBHLS Cecurred ata time that NOSUNKO claims to have been in
the American Department. Duri he 1962 meetings in Geneva,

when NOSEXZO said ne was Chief of the American Tourist Section,
ihe was asked about LLANE. He replies only that BLAKE had been
‘Van agent of the British Department of the Second Chief Direc-
orate" and that ie was not nearly as valuable as the Canacian
ipubassadork er "the other Englishman" (VASSALL).
{At the time of mis defection, NOSEWKC said he was First Deputy
Chief of the entire voi Department. Asked about BLAKE
after his defectioa, NOSUNKO replied: “Who's BLAKE?" During
the February 1965 interrogaticns, NOSENKO was first asked
whether the KGB had received any significant information con-
cerning the use of courism as operational cover by CIA during
1S60 and 1961, when ne was in the imerican Department, and
was then asked specifically whether the KGB obtained docu-
mentary information on this subject from an agent source. He
_replied "no" to both questions. . . '

** This document was transmitted from KGB Headquarters in Moscow
to the KGB Legal Residency in Helsinki on 7 April 1961, In
content it is similar to the general description of the docu~

.ment which NOSENKO said he himself wrote, NOSENKO said in
1964 that he knew GOLITSYN had passed CIA this report and that
it had been written in the Tourist. Department. . « :

McGOWAN mailed in Minsk an operational letter containing secre
‘writing. In the CIA debriefing upon his return to the United,
States, McGOWAN described a number of incidents in ‘the USSR. On:
20 August 1958, for example, while staying at the Metropol Hotel?
in Moscow, McGOWAN met Alan BALLARD* and Gertrude SAMUALS , fel-
low Americans, and the three of them were phctoyraphed by a sur-_
veillance team when leaving the hotel. Witt several days of

his arrival in Moscow, McGOWAN found he wes incempatible with

his female Inturist interpreter/guide and succeeded in having

her replaced... Mis new guide was V.L. ARTEMO¥, who assured that’ :
McGOWAN had female companionship for the remainder of his visit. ‘

The document from GOLITSYN also States: "SIMARD, Lionel,
born in 1939, a college instructor, expressed an ‘abnormal inter-
est towards military literature of the USSR; he made contact
with Soviet citizens and attempted to slip into the area of ship- ¢
building factories in Leningrad. Later it was recorded that this
*pedagogue', while in Moscow, sent espicnage letters containing
secret writing. The letter contained the coordinates of a dead-
drop for an American agent."

SIMARD went to the USSR as a CIA agent in August 1959, and
he believed that he was under complete KGB coverage while there,
He was in and out of Moscow four times during his trip, and each i
time he was assigned hotel rooms known to contain various KGB i
observation equipment, On one occasicn SIMARD was introduced to
and went out to dinner with Svetlana N. IVANOVA, who attempted :
to cultivete him,*** The characterization of his activities in |
the GOLITSYN cocument is correct. NOSENKO has not mentioned

SIMARD. —_-

Another part of the document supplied by GOLITSYN says:
“An American, Whitmore GRAY, born 1932, an assistant professor
at Michigan University, sent three espionage letters containing
secret writing, while in Kiev. In Stalingracé he was detained
while he was photographing a military factory."

GRAY arrived in Kiev on 3 November 1959 after having been
trained by CIA in countersurveillance and briefed on his letter-
mailing missicn and other assignments in the Soviet Union. Be-
tween midnight that night and one o'clock the next morning he mailed
four operational letters. No surveillance was noted during the

¥ NOSENKO reported on a 1959 trip to the Soviet Union by

BALLARD, but said he was not aware of earlier ones.

** This is the same ARTEMOV identified by NOSENKO as a fellow
ease officer in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American De-
partment and as the man with whom he worked on the BELITSKIY
case in Geneva in 1962, ARTEMOV appeared again in operations
against American tourists in 1959 when he was assigned as
Inturist guide/interpreter for a group of Americans which in-
cluded a CIA officer. On cne occasion, when.,this officer re- ~
turned unexpectedly to his hotel fromthe ‘theater’ to-which
ARTEMOV had escorted him, he caught ARTEMOV searching his
hotel room. NOSENKO has not mentioned these contacts of ‘
ARTEMOV, which took place at the time he said he was Deputy
Chief of the section dealing with American tourists. In «=?
October 1966, in answer to a specific question, NOSENKO stated
that ARTEMOV never had any connection. with the American Section
of the Tourist Department. . . .

The KG83 document elsewhere states: "A guide of a.tourist
group, John Milton FRANCIS, born 1934, an instructor of Russian

tourists-~American students--separated himself from.the group
and. travelled through the city alone. in a notebook which was
lost by him, notes and sketches were found which pointed to the
fact that he utilized his trip-for the purpose of selecting j
suitable places for the placing of deaddrops, or for checking ; '
those deaddrops which were earlier selected by American agents. :

In Moscow he selected routes which were used.to check and dis~ .
discover the existence. of surveillance, utilizing passable backyards

and following skillful methods. At the present time FRANCIS is

the chief interpreter of the State. Department, servicing Soviet

delegations in the USA." x

_ FRANCIS did have such a mission in 1958 and brought back a
notebock with sketches of the sites he selected. He did not :
mention losing his notebook. In 1954 and 1955 FRANCIS was in tl 3
frequent contact with V.V. KRIVOSHEY in Berlin; KRIVOSHEY, who ., ; of
served there until the late 1950's, has been identified as a KGB - : .
First Chief Directorate officer who later became an officer in
the Correspondents Department, KGB. Second Chief Directorate.*
FRANCIS was also a student of Richard BURGI at Yale in 1956, the
year that NOSENKO was involved in BURGI's recruitment (see Part
V.D.4.b.). NOSENKO has not mentioned the FRANCIS case and did
not recognize his name.

Besides these and other examples in the document GOLITSYN
gave CIA, there are indications of KGB awareness of the clandes-
tine activities of many other CIA contacts who travelled to the
Soviet Union as tourists during the period from 1955 to 1960.

Be January 1960 to January. 1962_ Umer ican Department)
. 1. Introduction

NCSENKO claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the U.S.
Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB Second Chief
Directorate, from sometime in January 1960 until the first days
of January 1962.* This section, in his. words, was working ©
“against "the most important counterintelligence target in the
Soviet Union,” the permanent Anerican representation in Moscow.
It regarded every American stationed there as a possible spy
and, simultaneously, as a target for eventual compromise and
recruitment.

The functions of the U.S. Embassy Section were described by :
_NOSENKO as being, first, to control all contacts by Embassy per- _ 4
sonnel with Soviet citizens; second, to evaluate information ~ 4 4
collected from all possible sources on American Embassy employees; . . :
and third,. to use this information as a basis for planning and :
carrying out recruitment approaches. The Americans' personal- 4
ities, jobs, personal relationships, weaknesses, daily routines,
security precautions, contacts wit h Soviet citizens, and the
major and minor scandals ‘in their Moscow lives formed the basis
‘for this work. To gather such information, the section's officers ~
directed and debriefed large numbers ‘of agents and informants,
including the indigenous employees of the Embassy, Soviet citizens
moving in Embassy social circles, and third-country nationals with
American contacts; the officers also assigned tasks to and assim-
dilated the reports from the numerous surveillance teams at their. : t
disposal, and they read and tried to-exploit materials from tele- ,
phone taps and microphones. placed in the offices and homes of
the Americens. Each officer had a limited number of American
-targets and attempted to become thoroughly familiar with :ach:
annually, they submitted detailed operational plans to exploit :
the knowledge they had gained of their target. During 1960 and 8
1961, NOSENKO said, special emphasis was placed within the section
on "identifying intelligence officers at the Embassy and active
development of them, the acquisition of ciphers, and the detailed
and painstaking study of code clerks, creating the conditions on
the basis of which they can be recruited.”

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO has said, he had
access to all information concerning its activities: "Nothing
was hidden" from him. On this basis, he expressed certainty
that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB did not recruit any Americans
associated with the Embassy, that no Americans assigned to the F
Embassy were being handled in Moscow as KGB agents in this i
period, and that, in fact, the KGB had recruited no American : : ;

Embassy personnel since "ANDREY."** From continuing friendships 7 Re
i with his fellow-officers of 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO has also Ff
t claimed certainty that there were no KGB recruitments from the ca 4
i : i

time he left the section in January 1962 until the January 1964
trip to Geneva.

¥— In debriefing and interrogating NOSENKO, CIA placed partic-
ular emphasis on his activities during the period January

1960 to January 1962, since this information was of special :
importance to U.S. Government security. .

‘See Part VI.D.3.b. fora discussion of the case of the KGB
agent “ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH), whose recruitment has been

Tourist Department's American Section because (as he explained. -

eategories of foreign visitors, was being reorganized in January,
1960 for work against tourists alone and the Deputy Cnief slot.
was eliminated.*. With the exception of A. A. DMITRIYEV, Marina
RYTOVA, and the homosexuals YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, NOSENKO turned
over all of his agents to another officer in the section named
TIMOFEYEV. NOSENKO said on 29 January 1965 that he had two
separate files on his agent Arsene FRIPPEL, a developmental file
and an operational file, and:that he turned the former over to

Tourist Department. During later.interrogations, however, NOSENKO

has said that he continued to handle: FRIPPEL while in the U.S.
Embassy Section and was the case officer during FRIPPEL's visits

2. NOSENKO's Transfer to the U.S. Embassy Section

In December 1959, while serving as Deputy Chief of the
American-Britisn-Canadian Section of the Tourist Department,
NOSENKO learned from K. N. DUBAS, the department Chief, of plans
to transfer him to the U.S. Embassy Section as Deputy Chief.
NOSENKO said he was opposed to the move and wanted to remain in :
the Tourist Department: "I was used to it there and wanted to i
continue. I wanted to stay in the Tourist Department. | This i
Zthe transfer/ was no promotion. Here I was the Deputy Chief :
of section and would be the same there. But, of course, its more . i
important there. The American Department is, of course, the most i
important. But here I was working against American tourists.
This is also important. Furthermore, I showed /had. proven/ my-
self there in '55, '56, '57, '58, and ‘59 and was considered to
be not a bad case officer. And here, in the American Department,
I must show /prove/ myself with new people." NOSENKO therefore
asked DUBAS in December 1959 to "please fight for me to stay."
DUBAS later told NOSENKO that he had twice spoken to Second
Chief Directorate Chief 0. M. GRIBANOV on his behalf, but to
no avail. iIn January 1960 the official orders transferring
NOSENKO were issued. .

On the day NOSENKO reported to V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the
American Department, to begin his new job, he was told to report
to GRIBANOV's office. To GRIBANOV NOSENKO again expressed mis-
givings about the change of assignment. GRIBANOV replied that
DUBAS had spoken to him about this but that he, GRIBANOV, “had

oe : .
* There was no change in the functions of NOSENKO's section,
however; as before, it continued to be responsible for
operations against tourists from the United States,

England, and Canada.

when he returned as a guide to tourist groups twice in
1962 and once again in 1963; see Part V.D.5.

“he thought NOSENKO could bring."fresh air" to the U.S. Embassy
Section's operations and that he was to pay particular attention

. "to operations against American code clerks, the “number one .
target."* Neither GRIBANOV nor KLYPIN told NOSEXKO why he had
been selected. for this position.or who had recommended him for
it.

_NOSENKO was asked on 17 April 1964 whom he had relieved
upon reporting for duty in the U.S. Embassy Section. He replied:
"Nobody." He was then asked to identify the persons from whom
he had assumed certain of his duties as Deputy Chief of the
section (these are ciscussed in detail below). NOSENKO said that
he took the responsibility for maintaining the section file on
the security of the U.S. Embassy from the Chief of the section,

Vv. M. KOVSHUK.** Regarding his responsibility as case officer for
the Security Officer of the Embassy, NOSENKO explained that be-
cause former Security Officer Russell LANGELLE had been declared
persona -non grata in Octoker 1959 and because his successor John
ABIDIAN was not to arrive until March 1960, no one in the section
had this responsibility when he, NOSENKO, arrived in January . i
1960. Asked who had been LAIGELLE's case officer, NOSENKO re- : q
plied: "LANGELLE was handled by several people - by 2a.S./ MALYU- 4,
GIN, then after that by /V.A,/ KUSKOV, then by KOVSHUK, then

* In late December 1961, GOLITSYN also comnented on this subject
to his CIA handling officer: "The task of strengthening of
wor’: against the Americans has been a standing requirement, ee
both in the past and most particularly at this time. This C_
work was particularly intensified after the appointment of
SHELEPIN to the KGB... In 1960, it was recommended in the
KGB to intensify the work acainst the Americans at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow, and against American colonies in other
countries... This question of intensifying work against the
Americans was up before the Collegium of the KGB. Thereafter,
there was a directive from SHELEPIN regarding the intensifi-
cation of work against the American cipher-clerks."

**There is an apparent contradiction between NOSENKO's desig-
nation oe gRQUSHUK 25-Chies ofthe Firat (U.S, Enbassy) Sec ae
tion i 960 and information earlier suppiie@ by GOLITSYN,
GOLITSYN told CIA of a conversation he had with KOVSHUK in :

Lo. January 1961 in Moscow (see Part V.E.3.c.2. concerning a.
; : . reeruitment approach to the American code clerk James STORS- cok
: BERG) but at that time described KOVSHUK only as an American 4
‘l:-/T .. + Department officer, without indicating his position. The Ss wks sp
‘ only time that GOLITSYN has given a position for KOVSHUK was
: in the context of questioning concerning KHRUSHCHEV's "Secret
Speech” denouncing STALIN in 1956; .GOLITSYN; said that ac this
time KOVSHUK was Chief of the American Department (sic) of
‘tthe Second Chief Directorate. On 16 February 1962 GOLITSYN
identified Vladimir PETROV as. Chief of the. "section concerned
with the American Embassy of the American Department of the
Second Directorate* in 1960., NOSENKO had identified PETROV
as Chief of the Second Section of the American Department,
which was concerned with the penetration of U.S. intelligence
operations inside the Soviet Union.

time that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief of the. section, had been _
the case officer for LANGELLE. Under interrogation in early - . i
1965, NOSENKO added’ that. BAKHVALOV had also been responsible for ~ a
maintaining the file on the security of the U.S. Embassy. At : at
this time he explained his earlier statement by saying that BAKH-. E
VALOV had left the Section before his arrival and had given. the "og
file to KOVSHUK to hold for his successor. The file continued to y.
be charged officially to BAKHVALOV, however, even though he, was :
no longer in the section, and NOSENKC arranged for the official
change of custody si.ortly after reporting for duty (see Part V.E.
3.£.). NOSENKO said further, in January 1965, that BAXHVALOV
had shared responsibility for supervising code clerk operetions-
with KOVSHUX before NOSENKO arrived to assume these duties him=
self, NOSENKO had been given a number of opportunities prior
to 24 June 1964 to identify BAKEHVALOV as his predecessor, bu
he did not do so. These are summarized below: -

Department of the Second Chief Directorate. He said that he
aid not know this person's last name, but that his first name
and patronymic were “ikhail Fedorovich. #hen shown the last

ae Introduction.

Shortly after reporting for duty ‘in ‘the U.S. ‘Eabassy
Section and following his. short discussion. with GRIBANOV,
NOSENKO met with Department Chief KLYPIN and. Section Chief
KOVSHUK to discuss his responsibilities and functions in ——
the section. Repeating what GRIBANOV had already said,

KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's most important single respon- .
yt sibility in the section would te supervision. of all KGB

mM operational activity against American military and State
Department code clerks stationed in Moscow. As forthe
other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN suggested a division
of labor under which KOVSHUK would be responsible for super-
vising operations against State’Department personnel and
NOSENKO would Supervise work against he Arny, Air Force,
and Naval attaches and their assistants.* NOSENKO was also
made respansible for maintaining certain files in the section.
On 19 February 1965 NOSENKO signed an interrogation proto-
col which he agreed contained a listing of his principaT -
responsibilities during 1960 and 1961. It read in part:

"During’ the egtire eriod in the First [U.S. . :

(41) Access

Since his defection NOSENKO has maintained under re-
peated interrogation that as general deputy to KOVSIIUK, with
the responsibility of taking over in KOVSHUK's absence, he
had acces. to all information on the section's activities
and was obliged to keep current. on this information. On
this basis he has been able to assure his questioners that
the KG8 was completely unsuccessful in its attempts to re-
cruit Americans assigned to the Enbassy in these two years.
NOSENKO has also said at various times that his access to
section files and his discussions with section officers made
it certain that there were also no successes fron 1953 to
1960 and from January 1962 to January 1964. His statements :
‘on this subject during the Februgry 1965 were distilled in
a protocol which NOSENKO signed on 20 ) February (quoted in

supervising GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV?.

AS i can't say.

Q: ‘Was it the most important function?

AS Yes, it was important. All work in the First

Section was important. This was the most impor~
tant. But one day I could devote the whole day
to code clerks, the next day maybe half the day,
maybe two hours in the day. The rest of the day
I will be absent. I will be meeting with KLYPIN,
or I will be having a meeting with: surveillance,
or I will be at ancther place. The third day,
again, maybe the whole day, maybe part of it.

No, I can't tell you. It depends on the situa-
tion.

(iii) Additional Duties in KOVSHUK's Absence
As Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, one of

NOSENKO's responsibilities was to serve as Acting Chief
when KOVSHUK was absent from the office. NOSENKO recalled

-that he fulfilled this function during KOVSHUK's two 30-day

leave periods in 1960 and 1961, but he did not remember

when this leave occurred in those years. He also served as
Acting Chief for about a month in the summer of 1960 when
KOVSHUK was ‘in the KGB hospital with heart trouble and for a
week or two some time in 1961 when KOVSHUK was i11 again..

’ NOSENKO was unable to recall any operational or. inspection

trips that KOVSHUK made in 1960 or 1961, and the only other
specific time that he could remember KOVSHUK being absent
was for several days in connection with preparations for
vacant Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in

NOSENKO's description of -his duties in KOVSHUK's ab-
gence was summarized in a protocol which he signed on -3/ March

_., 1965: s

(i) Introduction

Among the numerous KGB activities against American code
clerks in Moscow which NOSENKO has discussed are five opera-
tions wherein the KGB intended or effected approaches for ;
recruitment/defection ‘purposes. According to NOSENKO, none
was successful... The five major cases are reviewed separately
below, one of them in tae context of duty trips abroad by
NOSENKO's subordinate KOSOLAPOV, **

NOSENKO said that, upon assuming responsibility for
supervising operations against American code clerks, he
found a very "difficult situation." Prior to the assignment
of KOSOLAPOY to the U.S. Embassy Section in late 1959, all
operations against code clerks had been handled by 4,.S, MALYU-
GIN, but during MALYUGIN's two years of effort. there had
beer no operational approaches and no successes. When :

*The Edmund STEVENS case is.discussed in Part V.C.2.

**GOLITSYN on 20 March 1962 identitied KOSOLAPOV's photograph
as that of a veteran KCB officer with whom ke was personally
‘acquainted. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had entered the KGB
in about 1952 and had served for two or three years as a
member of the First [American] Department of the KGB First
Chief Directorate under United Nations cover in New York City;
subsequently he had worked for two or three years in the
First Chief Directorate at KGB Headquarters. According to
GOLITSYN, the bachelor KOSOLAPOV was transferred to the KGB
Second Chief Directorate some time prior to 1960 in line with.
- a KGB policy for only married men ‘to be sent abroad. As of +
1960, GOLITSYN said, KOSOLAPOV was working against code clerks i
_stationed in the American Embassy in Moscow. He added that
KOSOLAPOV speaks excellent English. Prior to GOLITSYN's
identification, CIA had no indication of intelligence acti- :
. . vity on KOSOLAPOV's part. Between February 1953 and April Oo A
ji 1955 he was assigned to the United Nations: Secretariat Trans- .
Soe lation Unit as a translator; in August 1958 he had been an
interpreter at the Geneva Conference on Nuclear Test Detectidn; _
in September 1959 he accompanied KHRUSHCHEV on his trip to ©
the United States (sce Part V.E.3.d. which desoribes the -
role of NOSENKO's target. John ABIDIAN in connection with the
_KHRUSHCHEV trip) KOSOLAPOV's English is flawless.

On the several operations ageinst military code clerks
which NOSENKO has described and in which he has claimed a
personal role, his greatest detail and emphasis has been given
to the case of James Harry STORSBERS. In 1962 NOSENKO said — .
that, in line with GRIBANOV's instructions that he pay parti- De

his time for almost a year to the STORSLERG operation, ané

(c) Information from PREISFREUND

CIA initially interviewed PREISFREUND on 8 July 1965 in
Helsinki. (NOSENKO himself had suggested that PREISFREUN!
would confirm his story of the STORSBERG case.) During this
first meeting with him, PREISFREUND correctly identified photo-
graphs of KOVSHUK, NOSENKO, and STORSBERG. He maintained, how-
ever, that his relationship with KOVSHUK and NOSENKO was strictly
on a business level, that he had never had anything to do with :
the KGB, and that he did not know what the initials "KGB" stand .-
for. Toward the end of this meeting, PREISFREUND allowed that
he may have been unwittingly involved in some ‘activity against
STORSBERG and agreed to tell the “entire truth” the following day.

On 9 July 1965 PREISFREUND described how he had been caught
in a blackmarket operaticn in Moscow and was, on this basis, re-
cruited by KOVSHUK "either at the end of 1959 or early 1960."
Several weeks later, he said, he was approached by NOSENKO who
explained that KOVSHUK was unavailable and that the KGB wanted
him, PREISFREUND, to arrange an introduction between STORSBERG
and a Soviet female, Irina, the daughter of a Soviet general.*

“| PREISFREUND then left Moscow, and when he returned about two

months later, he took STCR3SBERG to the Peking Restaurant, where
the introduction was effected, PREISFREUND, STORSEERG, Irina,
and another girl then went to PREISFREUND's hotei, where STORS-
BERG and Irina were intimate.

PREISFREUND said on 10 July 1965 that he was fairly certain
his recruitment took place in early 1960, probably in March or
April. At the time KOVSHLK had refused to explain what: the KGB
wanted him to do; he said only that they would talk about it
later but assured PREISFREUND that he would not be asked to
undertake anything detrimental to Finnish interests; nor did
KOVSHUK establish any means of communications with PREISFREUND,
telling him only that the KGB would know where to find nim.
PREISFREUND subsequently visited the USSR on several occasions,
but no contects were made. Just as he was beginning to believe

- that the affair had been forgotten, NOSENKO contacted him at

his room in the Berlin Hotel in Moscow. Asked to explain his
earlier statement that NOSENKO first met with him two weeks
after the recruitment, PREISFREUND said he could not remember
exactly how long it was, but that it was definitely on another
trip to Moscow and that it was probably several months later.

PREISFREUND was asked how he had first met STORSBERG. . He
first replied that it had been at America House and recalled,
that NOSENKO had simply told him to go there and "find Jim;"
it was only with some difficulty that he finally managed to
strike up an acquaintance at the bar. On second thought, PREIS-

_PREUND said, he may have first met STORSBERG at the sauna in

the Finnish Embassy in Moscow through a mutual Finnish acquaint-
ance. Throughout this initial period, NOSENKO and KOVSHUK made
repeated promises that once the introduction of STORSBERG to

the Soviet female had been accomplished, there would be no more

agent of the U.S. Embassy Section who was. handled by A.V
SUNTSOV.. .. . a :

(d) Information from GOLITSYN

GOLITSYN, who had server the ¥GB most recently as a counter-
intelligence officer in Heisinki during 1966 and 1961, reported
separately two possibly related leads to operations against Am-
erican personnel assigned to the United States Erbassy in Moscow.
One of these was a developmental operation against a military
code clerk which the KGR felt was aimost certain of success, the
other a recruitment approach to an Empassy employee which GOLIT-
SYN was told had beén successful. GOL@ESYN learned these two
items of information from different Ki. Second Cnief Directorate
officers at different times.

GOLITSYN provided the first of these leads on 23 December
1961, when he reported information he said he Learned during
conversations with his perscnal friend GRYAZNOY at KGR Head-
quarters in Moscow some time between April and July 1966.* At
that time GOLI?SYN was visiting the American ft
Second Chief Directorate in connection wommey preparations
for assignment in Helsinki as a First Chief Cirectcrate counter-
intelligence offi » GRYAZNOV told GOLITSY: GRYAZNOV,
had personally prepared an cperation volving ican mili-
tary code clerk to the point that the KGB was "99 per cent sure"
that the recruitment approach to this code clerk would be suc-
cessful. GOLITSYN subsequently asrreowed the time of his conver-
gation with GRYAZNOV down tc “April or May 19éC" and quoted
GPRYAZNOV as saying that the KGB "is certain that the recruitment
is preparea and will ke successful." GOLITSYN also said that
the recruitment plan for this operation "evidently involved a
woman,“ but could provide no further details. During these same
talks, according to GOLITSYN, GRYAZNOV said that although the
KGB had earlier recruited U.S. Department of State code clerks
in Moscow, this would be the first recruitment of a code clerk
in the office of the American Military Attache since the estab-
lighment of the Second Cnief Directorate's American Department
(in the 1940's).

GOLITSYN reported on the second operation on 26 February
1962, while discussing the KGB agent PREISFREUND. GOLITSYN
said that he first met PREISFREUND when the latter went to the
Soviet Embassy in Helsinki in connection with an application
for travel to the USSR. On several later occasions, GOLITSYN
said, the two men had drinks together in Helsinki cafes.
According to GOLITSYN, PREISFREUND had been used in the recruit-
ment in Moscow of at least one American who "could have been a
code clerk oc a diplomat." He also knew that the recruitment
had been accomplished "in 1960, at the end of 1960" and that
PREISFREUND, having met the target at America House in Moscow,
had helped to set up the target for the recruitment approach
by involving him in speculatory activities and by arranging his
introduction to various KGB female agents. GOLITSYN thought
that PREISFREUND had dropped out of the case after “he had helped
to create the circumstances” and had not taken a direct part in

a

*~“Aecording to NOSENKO, he himself was GRYAZNOV's superior at
this time. NOSENKO did not recali visits by GOLITSYN to the
U.S. Embassy Section in 1960.

during “December 1960."** GOLITSM related that he had visited |

the American Department to request permission to use PREISFREUND
operationally in Helsinki. This request was refused with the

a result of a drinking incident, HOVSHUK was denoted from De-
puty Chief of the American Department to Chief of its American
Embassy Section in 1959 and held this position until early 1962.
GOLITSYN said he had known KOVSi;UK for about ten years and i
characterized him as a capable officer with about 15 years of '
KGB experience, at least ten of them in the Anerican Department,

Second Chief Directorate. In about 1956, according to GOLITSYN, '
KOVSHUK was handling KG3 agent Henry SHAPIRO. CIA records show |
that in addition, KOVSHUK was involved in the Mescow and Wash- : '

part in the recruitments of Roy RHODES and Dayle SMIiH, in the
approach to Army Attache Walter MULE, code clerk Louis MANNHEIM,

» State Department Officer Richard HARMSTONE, and code clerk
James STORSBERG, and in the interrogations of CIA officers

Moscow; he returned to Helsinki ty rail a week later, on 28

ber of the Attache staff in Moscow has held a cryptographic

clearance and has been trained and has performed the function

of back-up for the military code clerk during periods of the ; i
latter's absence from the Moscow Embassy or inability to per- mn
form his functions for other reasons. .

STORSBERG was the only military code clerk assigned to the
Moscow Embassy from February 1960, when his predecessor, Everett i i
HOBSON, was reasSigned, until September 1961, when his successor, i
Mathew ZUJUS, arrived. STORSBERG himself arrived in Moscow in F
January 1960 and departed in November 1961. , : i

During the period of STORSBERG's tour in Moscew, back-up '
cryptographic duties were performed by the Military Communica- . *
tions Officer, CWO-2 HURLEY, HURLEY performed these duties on ' ie
a number of occasions, including the night of the approach to i :
STORSBERG, and he could be loosely termed a code clerk.* Addi-
tionally, he performed repair work on the cryptographic machines
and directed certain other sensitive activities at the Embassy.
HURLEY's tour in Moscow began shortly before: STORSBERG's, in
December 1959, and he served there until June or July 1962.

The only other person performing official functions in the
military code room during the 1960-1961 period was James KEYSERS,
who arrived in Moscow on 22 December 1960 and was assigned to ;
the office of the Air Force Medical Officer. As a concurrent
secondary assignment, KEYSERS worked as a clerk-typist in the
office of the Air Attache. From February until mid-April 1961,
as a collateral duty, KEYSERS worked in the joint military code
room where he was in training to serve as back-up cryptographer.
He was relieved of this duty in April 1961 for reasons of low . |

tion as "military code clerk" and HURLEY's duties as “mili-

tary code machine mechanic," he said on one occasion that
he considered both to be within the general category of
"military code clerks." NOSENKO reported that there was no

KGB operation against HURLEY.

aptitude and lack of interest; in June 1961 he was removed fron
Moscow because of reported homosexual activities.*

‘ - below), but because of the date of KEYSERS' arrival in Moscow,
he must be ruled out as a candidate for the first of GOLIT-
SYN's two leads discussed above. On the basis of available
information, it appears that the subject of this lead must
have been either STORSBERG or HURLEY, the only two “military
code clerks" in Moscow in the spring of 1960. The subject
of COLITSYN's second lead could have been STOPSB3ERG, HURLEY,
or, in fact, anyone else at the Enbassy, although GOLITSYN
suggested that he might be a code clerk and might be a mili-
tary man. By his statement that there was no KGB operation
against HURLEY, together with his description of the opera-
tion against STORSBERG beginning in the spring of 1960 and
his (and PREISFREUND's) assertion that PREISFREUND took part
in only one operation for the KGB--that against STORSBERG--
“NOSENKO has said in effect that both of GOLITSYN's leads were
to the STORSBERG cperation, which ended in failure. This con- -
“= €liets with GOLITSYN's report that PREISFREUND was involved vos
: in a successful recruitment operation in late 1960. There are
also inconsistencies between the NOSENKO and GOLITSYN leads
as regards the progress. of the operation. .GOLITSYN reported
_ that recruitment of: a code clerk was. "99 per cent" assured
in May-June 1960, whereas NOSENKO and PREISPREUND describe
-an operation which, at best, was just becoming active at that
time. GOLITSYN, in reporting his second lead, said that the b
. Operation in which PREISFREUND participated culminated "in an
". late 1960;“ NOSENKO reported that the only operation in which
. PREISFREUND took part ended in an unsuccessful approach to

(iii) TD¥'s by KOSOLAPOV on Code Clerk Cases:
(a) Introduction ; , :

a According to NOSENKO, the U.S. Embassy Section officer
KOSOLAPOV travelled only once to Helsinki, and KOSOLAPOV at.
that time succeeded in his mission of accompanying--together.
with a KGB femzle agent--a suspecteé American code clerk, Paul
Prancis JENNER, by train to Moscow. (The KGB later learned
that JENNER was nct a code clerx but a pouch clerk who also met
couriers at the Mcscow airport, NOSENKO said, and this KGB iden-
tification of JENNER's specialty is confirmed by U.S. Department
of State files.) .The report by NOSENXO on KOSCLAPOV is contra-
dicted ky two sources, travel records available to CIA and the
KGB defector GOLITSYN,

Statements made by JENNER in 1960 and 1962 parallel those
Of NCSENKO in 1964 and 1965 to the extent that two young Soviets,
aman and a woman, did converse with him on the train, and later
JENNER did encounter the same woman at a Moscow airport. Never-
theless, travei records contradict NOSENKO's statement that
KOSOLAPOV was the Soviet male aboard the train with CENNER on the

‘24-hour journey.

Although NOSENKO insisted that KOSOLAPOV was on a single
TDY to Finland, in early 1960, travel records show that KOSOLA-
POV (under a different identity) went to Helsinki in both the
spring and fall of 1960. Travel records on the second Helsinki
TDY Sy KCSOLAPCV, on which NOSENKO has not reported, are borne
out by GOLITSYN. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV, in order to lay
the groundwork for a future relationship in Mescow, accompanied
a U.S. Embassy code clerk by train from Helsinki about November
1960, or perhaps as late as the beginning of 1961. Again on
the basis of travel records, it has been determined that on
16 November 1960 KOSOLAPOV was a fellow passenger of an American
code clerk named John W. GARLAND on the daily train from Hel-
sinki to Moscow.

The following discussion of the TDY's of KOSOLAPOV is
divided into three parts: KOSOLAPOV's false identity for
travel, the early 1960 TDY, and the November 1960 TDY. Each
part incorporates the information from all sources, including
NOSENKO. :

(b) Palse Identity for Travel

Vadim Viktcorovich KOSOLAPOV was born in Perm' on 19 Febru-
ary .1928. According to travel records, one Viktor Dmitriyevich
KOLOSOV, born in Perm’ on 19 March 1927, was in Finland from
31 March to 2 April 1960, in Finland from 12 to 16 November 1960,

-and in Denmark from 25 October to 1 November 1961.* In July 1965,

Johan PREISFREUND (see Part V.E.3.c.ii.',on STORSBERG operation)

identified for CIA a photograph of KOLOSOV as that of a KGB offi-

cer named Vadim (last name unknown) who approached him in Moscow

KOSOLAPOV. : ” phe :

“Jguestion: How old was JENNER at the time?

NOSENKO: I don't know. We sent GRYAZNOV's agent, a ballerina,
to Vyborg as part of this operaticn. I think her
first name is Yeva, but I don't remember her last

- mame; her code name was "SOLISTKA"... She was placed
on the train in Vyborg as if she nad been visiting
someone there and was returning to Moscow. The main
idea was to place an agent near JENNER before he
even arrived in ‘ascow, We wrote a proposal to the
Chairman of the KGB-giving the reasons for doing this.
We explained that we had usually only one year in
which to work. The agent "SOLISTKA" met JENNER and
spoke with him. KOSOLAPOV also became acquainted
with JENNER and spoke with him, but I can't say that
they were all speaking together at one time. She
gave JENNER a telephone number. :

Bare Ss Sree terran ON

Question: A KGB telephone number?

i

NOSENKO: Of course not; it was her own telephone number, but
he didn't call her. We then noticed that he wasn't | :
working in the code room but in the mail room. 0.K., '
that was interesting too. We waited one or two
months for the call to come, but nothing happened.
When JENNER once went to the railroad station or
airport alone to meet the couriers, we sent her with
GRYAZNOV by car in an attempt to have them meet
again. JENNER saw her but @id not approach [her].
Instead, he turned in the other direction. Only
later did we learn that he is a very quiet person.
There was nothing else on JENNER at all except a
suspicion that he may have been a homosexual, but
there was no proof. He was like a child.

“Question: How much time did you have between the time of the
anketa's arrival and the time of JENNER's arrival?

NOSENKO: A month, plenty of time to prepare.
Question: A month?
: NOSENKO: Well, approximately a month. The usual approval

from the Central Committee was necessary so that
KOSOLAPOV could go abroad. oe

The remaining information on KOSOLAPOV's TDY in early 1960
comes from other sources:

- After arriving in Moscow on 1 April 1960, JENNER
reported that he was approa ed on the train from Helsinki
by two young Russians, ‘a b ané a girl, probably uni-
versity students."* The two Russians struck up a conver-
gation and were soon paiting him on the guestion of racial
discriminetion in the United States. They said that they
might see JENNER in Moscow. About three months later, on
29 June, SENKER was performing his normal duty of escort-
ing Embassy couriers to Sheremetevo Airport when he was
again approached by the kussian girl, Yuli, who acted . i
surprised to see hin and asked him to go outside to talk.
yuli explained that she was waiting to say goodbye to a
friend who was leaving on a flignt to Irkutsk (JENNER had
seen tne Irkutsk flight depart a half hour earlier) and
told JENNER that her male companion on the train trip to
Moscow, Yura, had returned to his studies in Vyborg.
Interspersed with Yuli's questions concerning JENNER'S : ;
impressions and personal activities in Moscow were others i
about how often he came to the airport and how he liked
his job at the Embassy. When JENNER said he must leave, .
she gave him her telephone number in Moscow and insisted
that he call her.** Sne advised JENNER that "it wouid be

better if you did not mention our conversation to anyone.”
t

- Besides information about his Soviet companions on
the Moscow journey, JENNER also toid U.S. Department of
State security officials about sexual advances made by
his first maid in Moscow and about provocative clothing ‘
worn by his second maid. (NOSENKO has not indicated that
either of these two women was u KGB agent, but has said
in another context that all maids of American code clerks
were KGB agents or informants.) ;

cnc Hace at tate tah hee

- CIA investigations showed that I. Ye. SERGEYEV, a
KGB officer and the Soviet Consul in Helsinki, contacted
the police chief there on 31 March 1960 to ask his assist-
ance in locating an American named Paul F. JENNER who was
due to arrive in Helsinki the day before.*** SERGEYEV

explained that he had some "business" with JENNER, but he

see tate

KOSOLAPOV was years of age at the time.

** NOSENKO has mentioned several times that GRYAZNOV's agent

did not specify its nature. Reportecly this was the first
time that SERGEYEV had made such a reguest cf the police
chief.°

= CIA travel records show that JENNER arrived in Eel-
sinki en route to Moscow on 30 March 1960 and ceparted ty ‘ |
train the following day. KOSCLAPOV arrived in Helsinki j <
the same day that JENNER ieft, 31 March 1960, and remained ;
there until 2 April 1969 when he too ceparted for Mosccw
by train. The Finnish train manifest for 31 March 1960
indicates that there was only one passenger abcard the
daily train leaving lielsinki ior Moscow on this cate,
Paul JENNER, listed as a U.S. citizen and secretary/archi-
vist. The manifest for 2 April 196C carries the name
viktor KOLOSSOV (KOSCLAPOV) and shows that no American
citizens were aboard.

(a) The November 1960 TDY (GARLAND Case)

Apart from denying that it ever tock place, NCSENKO hes said
nothing about a trip to Helsinki by KOSOLAPCV in November 1360,
but GCLI?TSYN said such a trip occurred and related it to an in-

cipient KGB cperation against an American code clerk.

GOLITSYN was not posted to the KGB Legal Residency in Hel-
sinki until July 1960, i.e., after KCSOLAPSV's first trip to
Helsinxi, under the KOLOSOV alias. He has reported that at
"about the end of 1960, about November or possibly by the begin-
ning of 1961," the KGB Second Chief Directorate sent a telegvam
to the Helsinki Legal Residency. The teicgram advisec that an
American code clerk would arrive in Helsinxi in trca..sit to
Moscow; the responsible case officer would te KOSCLAPOV, who
was being sent to Helsinki under an alias and under Vneshtorg i
cover; KOSOLAPOV was te strike up an acquaintance to be con-~
tinued with the American in Mosccw. j

The following extracts are from the transcript of GOLITSYN's
further remarks on this subject in early 1962:

Question: You say that around November 1960 KOSOLAPOV came
to Finland?

GOLITSYN: Came to Finland.

Question: He came under cover?

GCLITSYN: Yes.

Question: Under a new identity? With an alias?

GOLITSYN: Yes, as an employee of Trade Union (Vneshtorg).

But, of course, there may be seme different dates.

Maybe November. I suppose {believe] it was the . oh

_ RGB-Polish UB Activities Against MORONE ~~

Introduction

; : In 1961 CIA itearned from a Polish source who furnished
- much reliable and sensitive information that, with the assist--
: ance of its Polish counterpart, the Office of Security (UB),
the KGB in November 1960 becan using a female agent against
Joseph MCRONE, a U.S. Department of State cede clerk. assigned

to the American Embassy in Moscow in August 1960. The woman

mate with him in Warsaw, returned tc Moscow twice in February
1961, and there had sexual relations with him. The compromising
scenes of MORONE and the Polish UB agent were photographed.

This information cn the KGB operation was received by CIA soon
after the woinan's sécond visit to Moscow. On the basis of this
report, MORONE was interviewed and polygrapked in Oslo in May
i961, and he was transferred to Lisben from Moscow in August
1961. :

!
|
: NOSENKO gave'a fev details on the same case, without men-
' tioning the name of the KGB target, during the 1962 meetings in
: Geneva. In 1964 and 1965 he furnished more particulars on the i
j MORONE case, identifying three KGB agents (besides the Polish :
{ female) who participated in the operation. NOSENKO, however,
, said that two cf them added no information of us32 to the KGB
against MORONE, and that he was unable to remember what the third :
agent reported: statements by other sources indicate that re- 3
garding MORONE all three agents could have acquired information i
of operational potential for the KG8. NOSENKO has not reported,
as have other sources, that. a fourth KGB agent named Ella UMANETS
was in contact with MORONE, or that the KGB officer SKVORTSOV--
posing as MICHAUD--was with MORONE at America House on at least
one occasion, the night when STORSBERG says he was approached
by the KGB (see above). NOSENKO has ccnfused the MORONE case
with another by saying that a fifth XGB agent was directed
against MORONE, whereas she was apparently directed against the
American code clerk ZUJUS (see below). The sensitive source of
the original report on MORCNE stated that a KGB officer "VOLODYA"
. “(Vladimir, last name unknown) personally met the Polish female
agent when she arrived in Moscow, and NOSENKO said that the
KGB officer was his subordinate KOSOLAPOV. NOSENKO at first
too claimed a KGB photographic technician supporting the case re-
. _. ported to him, but he retracted this remark after CIA showed
‘him that travel records on NCSENKO made it impossible. for the
technician to have spoken to him as he described. According to
NOSENKO, MORONE was reassigned from Moscow before the KGB could.
take further steps against the code clerk, and he speculates
MORONE's transfer was prompted by American authorities' concern
Lo. over his relationship with one of the KGB female agents.

(pb) NOSENKO's Information

At his first meeting with CIA on.9 June 1962 NOSENKO made
a passing reference to an operation in which he had placed a
female agent of the Polish service in contact with an American
“from the Moscow Embassy while the latter was visiting Warsaw. - .
Later, NOSENKO said, he brought the same female to Moscow in-..- —.-.--:
order to obtain. further compromising materials on this American.

‘

Askéd'on 11 June 1962 whether he had had foreign’ agents
working against the U.S. Exbassy, NOSENKO described his having
introduced the idea of using such agents to :develop- Americans. ©

afraid of contacts with Russian girls. He said that he himself ..

had several of these third-national agents, that he sometimes
would ask the German and Polish services to supply him with
agents, and that it was unnecessary for him to explain their
intended use in operations against Americans. NOSENKO then -00- 5
gave an example: "Listen, the serazants [enlisted men] who  -~ ~
lived in America’ House had a custom--it was too far to go-to .
America, so where did they go to rest fon leave}? To Finland

or Poland. Why Poland? Because they can find wornen there, the
rate of exchange is good, and so on. What do we do? We planted
a female Polish agent fon an American] in Poland. Then she

comes to Moscow. We arranged a chancé meeting, and things de~-
veloped. Once two guys, a Marine guard and a code clerk went to
Warsaw. They were cn leave for a weex and a half. We knew

when they would be going. I made an immediate phone call to
Warsaw. 'Give me a woman,’ I said. ‘Get a gced whore for me
there, a pretty one Lut not one who strikes the.eye particu-
larly.' Well, they vent me such a girl. And I placed this

Polish agent on the same train, in the same car, even in the -o-

same compartment. ‘The train left. One of the Americans, the
one in whom we were particularly interested, the code clerk,
wanted the girl and there, in the compartment, hey went to bed
together wh le the other American slept. I toid the Poles in
darsaw to give the girl an apartment and to get photographs.
VYhey arranged an apartment and he came there. Everything was
O.K. After a week and a half he returned to Moscow, We did
not rush things. A month passed. Two months. Let's not rush,
I said. A half a year went by. I insisted they nothing further
may be done any earlier. Then I said, ‘All right, let's give
him this girl, this Pole.' She arrived [in Moscow] and they met
one another. I created the conditions: we created the condi~
tions. They slept with one another once, twice. A [Soviet]
girlfriend showed up. The same thing. And he also began to
sleep with the girifriend. The Pole left and he was with this
wRussian, and she was our agent. You see, first the boys are.
afraid of Russians. But {we gave him] a Pole and then transe
ferred him to a Russian."

NOSENKO stated on 1 February 1964: “I remember we were
working on one of the members of the guard of the American Em-
bassy, who was going to Warsaw for a good time, for a few days’
relaxation.* We wrote to our advisors [KGB officers attached
to the Polish UB] to do éverything possible--to get a pretty
Polish girl for the fellow and to photograph any intimate
scenes. The Poles introduced the guard to the girl, they did
have intimate relations, but they gave us photographs without
any intimate scenes. Just how they are sitting together, how
he is kissing her--that's all. Well, we got these photographs
and some time went by and then we asked that the Poles send -

us this Polish girl so that she could meet hin in Moscow. They

ble for Americans living there, on everything she saw or
heard concerning MORONE. KOSOLAPGY visited her several

Fouse and leave her on her own. Hanna went several tines
to America House in 196], but NOSENKO can recall nothing
that she tay have reperted on MORONE. The other East Ser-
man girl was documented as an Austrian. HOSENNO never
met her but recalled that she was asked for her documents
at America House on her first or second visit there. She
replied that she had left them at her hctel, left America
Rouse, and never returned. NOSENKO did net remember the
time when this incident occurred, beyond the fact that he
was still in the U.S. Embassy Section and that ABIDIAN
was the Erbassy security officer at the time.* .

’ Embassy and SOLAPOV's agent,’ reported everything he
heard or saw about Americans to KOSOLAFOV. NOSENKO re-
called nothing specific that Qe had said about MORONE.

apply to those surrounding a relationship between a woman
named Lillian (last name not known) and the military code
clerk ZUJUS. These details are given in Part V.E.3.c.(v).
-In any_event, the incident involving Lillian occurred after
the date when NCSENKG says he was transferred from the U.S.
Embassy Section. At the time, Hugh MONTGOMERY rather than

--From one of these agents, or possibly in some other man-

“ner, the KGB learned that MORONE was planning to jo on leave |
to Warsaw. NOSE!IKO, KOSOLAPOV, and GAYAZNOV thereupon 2ecided
to employ a Polish female agent in an attempt tc compromise his.
KOSOLAPCYV wrote tne draft of the cperational plan for the attempt, '
which was approved by GRIBANOV after some editing by NCSENKO fog
and KOVSHUX, chief of the section. ZOUSCLAPOV next met with a. “4
Polish UB counterintelligence officer in KGB Headquarters to ie
discuss the pian. The Fole was tcid that the target was a U.S. ~ .

Exbassy employee, but not that he was a code clerk; this fact
was deliperately kept from the Foles.

As a result of this meeting, a Polish girl was obtained

by the Polish UB and sent to Moscew Ly train. Upon her arrival
she was met by KOSOLAPOV, who took her to a Moscow hotel, where
he gave her instructions concerning rer role in tne operation.
The girl was told to mect MORONS on the train, flirt witn hia,
have him fail in leve with her, ccatinue the association, and
study hin. She was to teil him that she had becn in Moscow as
@ guest of her uncie, a member’of the volisn Trade Representa-

Because the KGS still lacked ccmpromising materials, KCSO-

during her visit. The requests were approved by higher KGB
authority. When the girl arrived, KOSOLAPOV met her alone and
_ took her to the Hotel Peking, to a specially equipped room. ;
‘Phe girl called MORONE at Ancrica Hause, and MCRONE subsequently t {

visited her in the hotel room two or three times, curing which
photographs were taken. These were placed in the KGB's file on

nitely prohibited. For this pursose, Svetlana IVANOVA (see
above) was supposed to lure MORCNE into the city, but befere

‘anything further could be done, the Americans ordered MORONE
out of Moscow before the end of his tour, possibly because they
were concerned about his association with IVANOVA. Therefore,
NOSENKO said, the KGB made no operational approach to MORONE
and no recruitment of him.

{c) Infornaticn from Cther Sources | . 4
}

A sensitive Polish source reported in 1961 that on 8 Novem-
ber 1960 a Polish female, an expérienced English-speaking agent
of the Polish LB, ar ed in Moscow where she was met by a KGB
case officer named "VOLODYA." She stayed at the Hotel Warsaw
in Moscow. The ¥FGB case officer, apparently from the American : 4
Department of the KG3 Second Chief Directorate, on 10 November ;
1969 pointed MORONE out to this agent at a railroad station in
Moscow. Under KGB instructions, the Folish female met MORONE
on the train to Warsaw, where intimacies began. In Warsaw on
12 November 1960 she was quite friendly with MORONZ, but pur- .
guant to instructions, she refused all overtures to engage in 3
intimacies. The next day she took MORONE to a Polish UB safe-
house suitably prepared for clancestine photography, and reveal-
ing photographs of an intimate nature were taken of MORONE
and herself. The female agent again travelled to Moscow on
5 February 1961 and stayed at the Peking Hotel. Further com-
promising photograpns were taken of her and MOPONE oa this
trip. The female agent travelled to Moscow a third time and
on 12 and 13 February 1961 more photographs were taken of her
and MORONE.

and he suggested that CLA approach 23 for this purpose.

ZUJUS arrived in Moscow in Septenber 1961 to assune

and he remained there until January 1963. Eter initially
confusing ZUJUS with James KLYSERS*#, NOS u first described
the XGB operation against hin in February 1964, According
to NOSENKO, neither E> nor any other source supplicd sig-

NOSENXO nevertheless in other contexts has mentioned two
fenale agents whe reportedly associated with 2UJUS, One is
Ella UMANETS, the other an Eust German woman posing as en
Austrian, WOSENKO indicated the latter was in contact with
MORONE (see above}, whereas it is clear chat ZUJUS was the
‘Ancrican code clerx who met this woman, .The Jate that she
and ZUJUS were together, however, falis during the sunner
of 1962 when, NOSENXU said,he was no loiger engaged in

made on 2 February 1964:

NOSENKO: With respect to ZUJUS, I'll tell you exactly what we
tried to do with him because I spotted this in some
notes. This mistake [confusion of KEYSERS and ZUJUS]

case officer working agaiyst hin was. GRYATNOY. He said that

that he did not knew then s of other agents involved, nor

of any unusual or interesting infornation concerning his,

‘although he had read the Second Chief Directcrate file on ..

ZUJUS. There was no information on ZUJUS from KGB micro-
phones, telephone taps, or surveillance. The KGB, NOSENKO
stated, did not make an operaticnal approach to 2UJUS

and did not recruit hin.

NOSENKO reported on 2 february 1965 that he hiaself
had supervised GRYAZNOV's handling cf the opeyation and
personally handled the nain agent, pyesil San NOSEXKO
read ali current reports on LUJUS as tnuey C20 into. the

which NOSENKO did not recall; NOSENKO was sure, however,
that there was nothing unusual or intzresting about ZUIUS's

family background, NOSENAO stated that the KGB was not
‘aware of any vices or vulnerabilities that ZUJUS may have

had, There was no recruitment and no approach by the
KGB--if there had been, eve after NOSENKO left che U.S.

(c) Infermation from Other Sources oo

In connection with a security investigation at the U.S.

which acknowledged his having had sexual relations with only

one woman in Moscow, an employee of the Finnish Embassy.

(vi) Approach to KEYSERS

(a) Introduction

U.S. Arny Specialist Fifth Class James KEYSERS began his
tour in Moscow on 20 iecember 1y60 as an assistant to the
Embassy Medical Officer, Donaid C, MARTIN, an Air Force cEp-
tain; as an additional duty he was assigned administrative
functions in the office of the Air Attiche, For a short per-
iod in early 1961 KEYSERS was trained to perferm back-up
cryptographic duties under Juces STOXSBERG in the military
code room, but he was relieved of this in Anril 196). because
of low aptitude, laziness, and lack of interest, Because of
his admitted h sexual tendencies, coupled with his attitude
and behavior, KEYSERS was removec from ‘toscow by his Americen
superiors in June 1961, The decision transfer him was
made on 13 June, and KEYSERS wes info d of it the fol-
lowing day; approximately two hours b re leaving America
House for the airport on 16 June, KE S received a letter
from the KGB suggesting that he defect, This was followed
by an approach to him at the Moscew airport, .

NOSENKO has ciaimed that he was the KSB cfficer who
spoke to KEYSERS on this occasicn and has said that this
incident was his only face-ts-face contact with an American
target during his 1966-1961 period of service in the U.S,
Embassy Section (excepting the alleged brief encounter with
STCRSBERC+-See above), NOSENXO has confused the KEYSERS and
ZUJUS cases, but correctei this error prior to defecting.

In most particulars NOSENKO s account of the case matches the
details from KEYSERS and other sources, licwever, whereas
NOSENKO stated (without indicating how the KGB obtained its
information) that the KGB knew YSERS had not told American
authorities or having received the letter, KEYSEAS did so
before leaving Moscow; this conversation took place in an
Embassy room where a KGB micropnone was then located,

(b) Information from NOSENKO

NOSENKO first spoke of the case, without naming
KEYSERS, on 12 June 1962: ‘Now I remember, He came to Mos-
cow, to the Enbassy. He was to replace the military cipher
clerk [STORSBERG],® We sensed at once [that he was a homo-
sexual}. Well, everything was thrown at him, I stayed with
this case constantly, I didn't spend time on anything else.
We chased him ali over Moscow but were late. We were in an
Operational car, It happened iike this. When there was
traffic, you couldn't get through, Whether we went up the
left side or on the sidewalk where people were walking, in
the opposite direction, no matter. Therefore we vero late,
Jate [i.@., could not catch him at anything]. But-such

w“Although AcYSERS trained in Woscow to assune back-up
Cryptographic duties, he was not STORSBERG's replace-
ment; Mathew 2UJUS, who arrived in September 1961, was.
KEYSERS was assigned to Moscow as a replacement for
Staff Sergeant J.C. BRADLEY, who had earlier been reo
turned from Moscow for reasons of homosexuality,

things happen. But we were not mistaken about this fellow.
He proved to be a homosexual. te soid himself, so to say. The
: American ice ballex (ice Capades tour) arrived. There vere .
an many such fellows (homosexuals) with it, and he was extremely Lf
drunk, and was embracing and kissine a man. The Americans also
saw this. And decided not to... I thought, whet to do? Let's
write him a letter, in real English, on an Enciish typewriter.
We'll send this letter to his room. ‘We knew that he was supposed
to leave today, today. Ard we wrote it: ‘Listen. they know
about you, You have been -eaght. It will go very bedly for you
back there. Come on. Stay here. We are waiting ror your
answer.’ Weli, as 1s customary, you had someone accompany him.
The Assistant Military Attache escorted him. I Gor't remember
who right now. Perhaps it was NIMON, NIELSON. 2 lieutenant
colorel., What was his naze?* He accet.panied him to Finiand
ard then returned by piane. Well, there was no answer from
him to this letter, And 1t was already the lest moment, and
suddenly--'Listen, they ave teking you away. wait, they know
who you are, what you are, it's all over, If that's the wey
it is, stay here.’ No answer. What to do? Here's what happened:
We got into a car, They (KGS surveillance) hei reported that he
and the Assistant Military Attache had puiled*our from Kropotkin-
skaya Naberezhnaya (America House) for the airport to take the
plane. So we put on al: speed to get there iirst. We got there :
first, in order to have got to him. No. It was WILSON." The '
anterview then continued: NOSENKO was asked who had accompanied
KEYSERS to the airport. te replied:

as

"Yes, Lt. Col. WILSON, I believe. He didn't leave him
for a moment at the airport. I am turning around here, walking
there. There is coffee there ani cognac. He didn't leave him.
I must separate them. O.K. So ! said ‘What about their
documents? Make some pretext to separate them.’ They were
‘Beparated for two minutes. I approached him and said: ‘Hello,
helle, what acout the letter? You think about it?' He said
something to the Assistant Military Attache, that ‘they tried
to approach me.' So he was in Moscow in all only three or
four months. He gave himself away you see. If this ice ballet
had not come we would have worked on nim. At the start we did ;
not know who he was or what he was, 1.e., we knew that he came’ tO i
to replace the military code clieck, on whom we had spent much it i os
time." NOSENKO then moved on to a description of the STORSBERG , Pan 4
:

operation without naming KEYSERS.

After describing the recruitment approach to STCRKSSERG,
NOSENKO reported on 24 January 1964: “Then his replacement —
came. It was ZUJUS.** We began to study him carefully and
it appears that both ourse!ives and the Americans, primarily !
in the person of the Security Officer, discovered that he : :

completed. his: Moscow tour in November. 1961,. five months
after KEYSERS” was removed from Moscow. ~ P

Sone. : was a homosexual, It appears.thct thete was sone: visiting
some a -.s..:: ballet troupe in which some of the malé members were hono- --
. oe sexuals, He met them in the America Hogse ind his behavior

towards them was reported to the American Security Officer

and at the same time our agent had reported him to us. We

wanted to mount an operation against hia but the Americans

had already decided to give him up. All we could do was

to have a letter delivered to him; the letter warned hin -

that he was being sent out because he was a hemosexual

and that he would get into consequent trouble, and an oifer

was made to him to stay in the USSR. He did not answer

the letter and it was just prior to his actual departure.

He was escorted to.the airport by two officers of the

Military Attache's office, At the airport--I even went

there with a group of assistants to see if we could get a

few words to him to change his mind, ‘lie left his group

for a moment to get a drink of water. When I made this

offer to him that he would not regret it if he stayed,

that he wold receive great benefits, he panicked and van

back to his group and shortly thereafter he flew off. I£ . i
— he were-not spotted by you possibly we would have been abte Te ed

: to get at him." : a

While reviewing a list of personnel assigned to the
American Embassy in Moscow in 1963, NOSENKO said on 28
January 1964: ‘Matthew ZUJUS--how come? That man can't
be in Moscow, That's the honcsexual code clerk ! told
you about, [the] homosexual who was urgently sent back to
the States with military guards, How come ne is back in
19637 In August 19637 He couldn't be there. It is
impossible" He was asked whether he was sure cf his :
facts, and NOSENKO answered: "Yes, this must be the i
same man, but this must be an error in your document. :
He just cannot be in Moscow." : .

i

NOSENKO telephoned the Geneva safehouse on 2 February
1964 and said that he wanted to come right over as he had
something important to say. The meeting with CIA opened
-as follows: "I was thinking last night and I realized |
|
|
|

that I have made a mistake and it bothered me, so i
wanted to be sure to call it to your attention today. Re-
member when I told you we were working on Jim STORSBERG,

., the code clerk, and after that a replacement came for him?

, And I said that we wanted to get a hold of hin because he .

" was a homosexual? It was not ZUJUS, but it was KEYSERS.
In ‘other words, everything I said about 2UJUS applies to°
KEYSERS."

"I don't remember having any face-to-face encounters
(with Americans] except when KEYSERS was leaving,'' NOSENKO
stated on 17 April 1964, “When he was being taken to the.
airport we decided, ‘Why not try, in case he's alone; why
not approach him and ask’ hin if he wants to stay?’ And sure
enough he stood there with these two officers and then he a
walked into the restaurant alone... So 1 imnediately ap- *
proached him right _there in the restaurant. "1! don't re- 53
member what his name was--I think it was Jis.) -So I. said"
_ ‘Jim, did you think about staying perhaps? Because you :
- know what will happen to you when you return. Say, please."
. He looked at. me and turned. around and without saying a word | |
he went into the waiting room and. started talking rapidly les
‘with the officers.” : : s :

d. . NOSENKO's Responsibility for Coverage of ABIDIAN’ 0
(4) Introduction a

me John V. ABIDIAN served as the U.S. Embassy Security Officer

: . in Moscow from 2 March, 1960 until February 1962, approximately.
the same period as NOSENKO's claimed’ service in the U.S. Erbassy’
Section of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate.

: During hig Moscow tour, ABIDIAN was coopted by CIA to perform a

* number of operational tasks, including clandestine letter mailings
to several CIA agents inside the Soviet Union and servicing @

- dead drop to be used only for receiving two special types of
communications* from the source in the GRU, Colonel 0.V. PENKOV-
SKIY.

During his 1962 meetings. with CIA, NOSENKO mentioned ABIDIAN 4

Officer and as a CIA officer. In 1962 he described ABIDINN's

January 1964 NOSENKO divulged that he nad keen the KGS case : a

officer responsible for coverage of ABIDIAN in Moscow; for the

first time he described then a visit made by ASIDIAN to the

PENKOVSKIY dead drop site,

The discussion below is divided into three parts: NOSENKO's :

case officer responsibilities and the information he learned i i

ebout ABIDIAN, NOSENKO's knowledge of clandestine letter mailings | H

Street dead drop. :

(ii) Duties as Case Officer

On 17 April 1964 when asked to describe his transfer from
the Zourist Department to the Anerican Department in January
4960, NOSENKO said that when he reported for duty and was inter-
viewed by V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the American Department, and
V.M, KOVSHUK, Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, he was told
that as one of his duties he would be the case officer in charge
of ABIDIAN, whose arrival in Moscow was expected in the near
future. NOSENKO was the only KGB officer responsible for cover-
age of and activities against ABIDIAN and, NOSENKO said, ASIDIAN
was the only American target for whom he, personally,: was offi-
cially accountable while in the U.S. Embassy Section. '

NOSENKO was questioned in detail concerning ABIDIAN for
six days in January and February 1965. He produced the infor-
mation in the following paragraphs at that time.

ote hen NOSENKO began to work in the U.S. Embassy Section,
_ABIDIAN had not yet arrived in Moscow. The section, however, .
_. @lréady had received some information on him, and this was given © .
“ to NOSENKO by KOVSHUK. Among this material was ABIDIAN's vise:

One type was early-warning information, the other notifi-
. cation: of his forthcoming absence from Moscow. Otherwise,
as of this time, PENKOVSKIY submitted information in
Moscow via contacts with the British Embassy and the
British businessman Greville WANNE. The PENKOVSRIY case
is discussed at greater length in Part VI.D.7.b

application, the negative results of checks of KGB Headquarters

_ files, and a report prepared by the American Department of the

* First Chief Directorate. According to this report, based on
correspondence from the KG3 Legal Residencies in the United

| States, ABIDIAN had served asa Departmént of State Security

« Officer concerned with the personal safety of Premier XHRUSHCHEV

: when he visited the United States in 1959: from the way ABIDIAN
had acted at that time, the Legal Residencies concluded he was an
intelligence officer, prokably with CIA.” NOSENKO remarked that
the report, combined with the fact that ABIDIAN was replacing the
known CIA officer Russell LANGELLE as Security Officer, made
ABIDIAN one cf the most important counterintelligence targets
of the U.S. Embassy Section and therefore of the entire Second .
Cnief Directorate.

NOSENKO personally opened the KGB file on ABIDIAN and later
assigned him the Cryptonym “APSEN,” since this Cryptonym had been
used by personnel of the Seventh (Surveillance) Directorate,
KGB-Second Chief Directorate, who were working against him.

NOSENKO was unsuccessful in his attempts to learn more about
the life and career of ABIDIAN. He visited the Chief of the i
American Department of the KGB First Chief Directorate, but this
unit had no information in acdition to that already included in :
the original information ceport. NOSENKO requested that the KGB :
Legal Residencies in the Uniced States be asked for further de- .
tails, but they were never received. For these reasons, NOSENKO i
said that he did not know and never obtained details about ASID-
IAN's education and study abroad. date of entry into the Depart- :
ment of State, promctions, personal rank. previous foreign assign- : pt
ments, military service. or status as Foreign Service Reserve,
Staff or Officer (FSR, FSS, FSO),**

and then secured empioyment with the Department of State as
a clerk/typist. He cemained in Paris until 1954, After spe-
cial training at the CIC schoo! at Fort Holabird and the
Secret Service School. ABIDIAN served from 1956 until leaving
for Moscow in 1960 as a special agent in the State Depart-
.ment's Office of Security. A iarge part of his work ‘in this-
period was arranging the security of and accompanying foreign
dignitaries visiting the United States. These included the
visits of Soviet Foreign Minister SHEPILOV in November 1956,
MIKOYAN in the spring of 1959, and KHRUSHCHEV at the end of
1959. These duties undoubtedly brought ABIDIAN into contact
with a large number of KGB officers stationed in New York and
Washington. One of the members of the KHRUSHCHEV entourage
was KOSOLAPOV who, according to NOSENKO, joined the U.S.
Embassy Section in late 1959 and, as of January 1960, became

. eke subordinate in operations against American code

+. Clerks.

available to cover him if he left the U.S. Ambassy. The only
time this intensity of coverage might heve been reduced, NOSENKO
said, was during a period of about one and one-half months in
1961, when surveillance of the Fmbassy was generally reduced in
erage of British tergets.* As the
responsible case officer, MUSENKO directed the sucveiliance of
ASIDIAN ard evaluated the operational possibilities offered by

** NOSENKO first identified GXOMCKOVA as a KG ager.t when viewing
Embassy employee lists on 28 August 1364. The list on which
her name appeared indicated she was a Russian language teacner,
and NOSENKO said she was handled by N.A. GAVRILENKO during 1960
and 1961. NOSENKO was later shown GROMCKOVA's photograph and
failed to recognize it? wnen told her name, however, he again
said she was GAVRILENKO's agent and that she was valuable be-
cause she had a good education and was able to provide per-
sonelity sketches or her students. He did not associate her
with ABIDIZN until he was told by his interrogators in Febru-
ary 1965 that ABIDIAN had been one of her students. NOSENKO

then made the above statement concerning these lessons. ABIDIAN..

. reported that: he took regular language lessons from GROMOKCVA,
normally three one-half hour lessons a.week. beginning shortly-
after his arrival in Moscow and éontinuing until his departure.
The first few lessons were with a group of other Embassy per-
sonnel, and then ABIDIAN switched to private lessons for the .
remainder of his tour in the Soviet Union. In reporting his

Baku Restaurant. when informed that ABIDIAS gave "KAMO" his
telephone number, NOSENKO recommended that 'KAMO" try to develop
a relationship with ABIDIAN. After arguing that this was against
the policy of taking no aggressive or provocative action against
ABIDIA!, KOYSHUX and KLYPIN fineily agreed, and "KAMO" phoned
ABIDIZN twice on KGB instructions. ABIDIAN, however, refused to
meet Lim, and no further action was taken.*

NOSENKO did not know the room number of ABIDIAN's office in
the Embassy or on what floor it wes located, but said that he
coulda check the room number if necessary since he had a copy of
the Embassy telephone List published monthly with the office room
rumber of each American employee. ABIDIAN'S office was in the
“Zone of Security” (1.e., secure office areas). A report from
some agent, wrose name NOSENKO did rot recall, indicated that
there was a sion on ARIDIAN's office door which said “Security
Offi: 2." NOSENKO did not krow and said he was unable to deter-
mine whether ASIDIAN had a secretary. to dictation cr conversa-
tion was heard from AVIDIAN's office because no XGB microphone
was trere, and NC KO said that ne did not remember any specific
interesting or important information about ABIDIAN from other
microphones in tne Embassy.**

NOSENKO @i@ mot know the location of ABIDIAN's apartment in
the Embassy building, nor how it was furnished. He said that
he Gig not consiger data of this nature to be operationally
significant unless the target had shown vulnerabilities or was
under active development.

Aware that ABIDIAN travelled from the USSR two or three times
while staticned in Moscow, NOSENKO did not know to which countries
he went or the time of year when the trips were madet* Such in-
formation, he stated, would have peen of interest to him as
ABIDIAN's case officer since, like LANGELLE s earlier trips
abroad, AHIDIAN’s trips were presumed to be for operational pur-
poses. There was, however, no possibility for the KcB to find
out where ABIDIAN had gone:**** even if the U.S. Embassy Section
did establish where ABIDIAN would travel, nothing could be done

® See below for ABIDIAN's account of a similar incident involv-
ing a Soviet he met while on a trip to Armen1a.

** In 1960-61 the Security Officer occupied a room where an in-
operative microphone was discovered in 1964.

**#aBIDIAN made at least three trips abroad during his two years
in Moscow. in August 1960 he took personal leave to visit
his fiancee, a French girl, in the south of France and met
with a CIA officer while there. In February 1961 he flew on
the Ambassador's plane to Paris for meetings with CIA and
then took personal leave to visit his fiancee. In September
1961, at CIA request, ABIDIAN again flew to France and to
New York City and Washington for briefings connected with
the handling of PENKOVSKIY in Moscow.

. In February 1965 NOSENKO was asked a number of times
whether he knew of any occasions on which A3:DiAN took trips in
the Soviet Urion cutside of Moscow. He replied each time that he
knew of no such trips and that 1f ABIDIAN had made such @ trip or
trips he would have known of them and would remember them as it
would have been his responsibility as case officer to take cer-
tain actions. Among the latter he listed:

~ Receiving notification of ABIDIAN's request to travel
from the UPDK (the Seviet Government organization which pro-
vides services to tre diplomatic community in Moscow).

~ Notifying the UPDK of KGB approval for the trip.

- Notifying appropriate local KGB offices on ABIDIAN 's - 4
itinerary and giving them instructions for surveillance and :
other operational activity if desired. :

~ Receiving. reading, and filing all surveillance
reports and reports of other operational activity carried
out by locak KGB units.

NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps. He stated ;
further that even if he were absent when such a request for travel : i
wes made. he would have seen all documents upor. his return and

that he @id not remember seeing such cocuments in ABIDIAN's file.

a@ dacha near Moscow and therefore was not allowed any travel

code clerk John GARLAND (Part V.E.3.c.i.). CIA records

show that ABIDIAN mailed the first of his clandestine

letters or. 1 April 1961 and his second, the one to .
“ARKHANGELSKIY", on 2 July 1961. I£ ASIDIAN's recollec- _
tion is correct (a review of Embassy phone lists shows that

KENMER was in Moscow in June 1961, but was not there in

August of that year), it appears that FEDOROVIGH could not

have been responsible for the metka which, NOSENKO said,

led to discovery of the first of these letters; also, it ,
is possible that she was not employed by ABID™AY at the time , :
the letter to "ARKHANGELSKIY" was mailed. ABIDIAN's third :
clandestine letter was mailed on 1 September 1361, appar
ently after FEDORUVICH came to work for him, ‘hen NOSENKO
was told in January 1965 that FEDOROVICH could not have
been applying metka regularly to ASIDIAN's clothing at the
time of the “ARKHANGELSKTY" letter-mailing, he repeated
that no ome but FEDGROVICH had the possibility of doing
so and that he was sure she had. when his interrogators
suggested that FEDOROVICH may have occasionally cleaned
ABIDIAN's apartment on an informal basis before being
formerly hired as his maid, NOSENKO said that this was
possibly the case. (CIA does not know whether this was

so or not, but ABIDIAN gave his interviewer the impression
in Decemrer 1964 that he did his own housekeeping until
hiring FEDOROVICH.)

) ABIDIAN's Servicing of the Pushkin Street Dead Dro

;

In 1964 NOSENKO told CIA for the first time that KGB sur-
eillance had observed a visit by ASIDIAN to a probable dead
/ drop on Pushkin Street in Moscow ac the erd 9 1960. This dead
/ drop figured prominently in the PENXOVSKIY case,

/ NOSENKO's first remarks on this subject were made on 20 April :
/ 1964: "I left /the U.S. Embassy Section’ in 1962. There was an
interesting move. This address where JACOBS* was caught in the

/ - PENKOVSKIY case - the same address was visited by ABIDIAN in
fags f 1960, or at the beginning of 196i. And at that time I went there
bd i together with /V. A./ KOZLOV, the cnief of the Surveillance ;
fe Directorate. /M. G./ MATVEYEV /Deputy Chief of the auerican
| {f Department/ also went there with us. We went to that address
é several times, at Pushkin Street. it was very interesting, this

radiator ard everything, but the only thing we did there was to
place an observation post there, end that post was there for
about three months after ABIDIAN's visit... That was in 1960,
196i... They watched for three months. Tre surveillance teams
had to_be occupied there for 24 h s every day. I was there
then /in the U.38. Embassy Section for the entire time that sure
veillance was watching the Pushkin Street site7... At the be-
‘ginning I came there two or three times. I ceme there with
MATVEYEV once, twice with KOVSHUK; we came there with Venyanin
KOZLOV,.. But no one appeared here and so they were not writing
anything /meaning that the Surveillance Directorate was not sub-
mitting written reports/, No one appeared. That's why, only
orally, KOZLOV was saying ‘nothing A week passed - 'nothing,
the next week passed - ‘notning'... I shall tell you why a
didn't mention this to you in June 1962/. Because I had
occasions where there were many such places, and they were
watched for nothing. And it would just pass away and ina
month it would be forgotten... So we waited a month, two,
three. Nothing. So they let it go at that and had forgotten.
Of course, the surveillance team had it_all recorded. but we .
had forgotten about that in the_First /American/ Department...
In 1962, I was in the Seventh CTourist/ Department. I trans-
ferred in January 1962," .

On the basis of information supplied by NOSENKO during Lo
April 1964, he was questioned during January and February 1965
on ABIDIAN's visit to Pushkin Street. The following, which is
consistent with and somewhat more Getailed than earlier state- oF
eats not recorded here, is taken from these 1965 interroga- i

ons:

- In 1961, while NOSENKO was the responsible case
officer, the KGB followed ABIDIAN from the U.S, Embassy
to @ residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow.

A stationary surveillance post et the Embassy saw ABIDIAN
leave with the Publications Procurement Officer of the
Embassy in a chauffeured automobile, rather than in the
car he normally used. The surveillance team assigned
specifically to ABIDIAN thereupon followed the car to

@ bookstore. Both Americans entered the bookstore, but

: shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone, He walked around

. : few seconds. The surveillance team saw him. go in but. did : : . : .
not follow him. This unusua} incident was reported by er ts ioe
the surveillance team to the KGB Seventh (Surveillance) 4
Directorate, and the building was inspected that same day : t
by the Chief of the First Department of the. Surveillance i
Directorate, KOZLOV, together with the Deputy Cnief of the
American Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,
MATVEYEV. Taking into account the character of the building
and its inhabitants, the duration and. circumstances of
ABIDIAN's visit, and the suitability of the hallway -
particularly the radiator in it - for. use as a dead drop
site, it was decided by the leadership of the Second Chief
Directorate and the Surveillance Directorate that a station-
ary surveillance post should immediately be set up to cover
ee ee ———this location. Because of the short time evailable, it was
7. not possible to place this pgst inside the building, so it
was set up across the street, In addition, the radiator
was checked daily to see if anything, such as a macnetic
container, had. been concealed behind it. This stationary
post was maintained around the clock for 39 days, after
which it was maintained from 0800 until midnight for another
two months. If a package or magnetic container had been
found behind the radiator, which was checked every morning,
it was planned to artach to jt very thin wires to tricger
a signal should someone remoye the package. At the same
time a member of the surveillance team would be stationed
on the landing of the staircase in this building, out of:
sight from the hallway below, During the three months
that the post was maintained, nothing was found concealed
behind the radiator, nor were any suspicious persons seen
entering or leaving the building. The post was then dis-
continued, but the address was placed on a list of sus-~
5 picious places inspected daily by the Surveillance Direc-
: torate. The true significance of this location became
known to the KGB only later, after the arrest of PENKOV- . ; i

‘ , ‘pected dead drop site on the day it occurred. . He was

' sitting in KOVSHUK's office when he received a telephone
call from MATVEYEV telling him of the incident. Although
NOSENKO was ABIDIAN's case officer and KOVSKUK was Chief
of the U.S. Embassy Section, the decision to place the
‘stationary surveillance post on this location was made at
a higher level: neither of them was involved in it or in

iP wo the later decision to discontinue the post. NOSENKO' him-

| aoe self visited the building on Pushkin Street the following

2 Sues - @ay or the day after, but he remained only a few minutes

~ and did not recall any details of the hallway, except that —

- there was a radiator there; Dyiees ee : :

(l= -As ABIDIAN's case officer, NOSENKO recalled re-
ceiving the surveillance report of his visit to the .
“Pushkin Street building and placing this report in _
‘ABIDIAN's file. (This is the case file which NOSENKO’

aber” A. a

‘turned over to his successor, “GRYAZNOV, about 28-28 December
1961, just before he transferred to the Tourist Department.)

- NOSENKO received no written reports on the results
of the stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss.
this matter with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during
the first month of surveillance, periodically after that.
These discussions took place either by telephone, or when
KOZLOV was visiting NOSENKO's office, or when NOSENKO
visited KOZLOV's office in KGB Headquarters. From KOZLOV
or perhaps someone else, NOSENKO learned that the post had
been discontinued after 90 days. On the basis of these
conversations with KOZLOV, NOSENKO knew that nothing of
interest occurred during the period of the stationary sur-
veillance.

~ NCSENKO was in the U.3. Embassy Section during all
the period that the stationary_surveillance—pest—was—wateh= ——
ing the Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard Lo
from KOZLCV that the post had been replaced by periodic
inspections.

- NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance
on the Pushkin Street dead drop site to his CIA contacts
in Geneva in June 1962 because the post had already been
discontinued by this time without anything unusual or sus-
Picious having been noted. Therefore he thought that this
incident would not be particularly interesting to the CIA.

cemeeitpesbente de

CIA records show that ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street
dead drop site only once, on 30 December 1961, a year later than
NOSENKO says, in response to an apparent signal from PENKOVSKIY.
The sequence of events was as follows: On 27 December 1961,
following receipt of what seemed to be the prearrang2d signal
from PENKOVSKIY that the drop had been loaded, Air Force Captain
Alexis DAVISON drove from his apartment to the U.S. Embassy to
alert ABIDIAN. At about 2100 hours the same night, ABIDIAN
left in his own car for Spasso House, the Ambassador's residence
om where a dance was in progress, to tell the CIA Chief of Station,
‘ S Paul GARBLER, about the signal. ABSIDIAN and GARBLER left Spasso
House with the other guests at about 0200 on 28 December in
. ABIDIAN's car and drove past the telephone pole where, as part
i of his "drop loaded" signal, PENKOVSKIY was 'to leave a mark. -
Later in the morning of 28 December, ABIDIAN, again in ‘his own
car drove from the Embassy to DA/IDSON's apartment, ‘where he
first checked the telephone pple visually from the window and. whee
then walked by it for a closer examination. Although it was
not certain that the telephone calls received on 27 December . .
had, ‘in fact, been a signal from PENKOVSKIY and although no |
supplementary mark was found on the telephone pole, a decision
was reached to check the drop. Therefore, at 1115 on 30 Decem- . ce
ber 1961, ABIDIAN with Julian F. MacDONALD, an Embassy Economics : woot
“i, Officer, left the Embassy in an official car with a Soviet - Trash
@river and proceeded to a bogkstoere on the corner of Pushkin : -
Street. At 1130 ABIDIAN entered the building where the drop 2
site was located, determined that the drop was empty, and
left one minute later.. The pair then returned ,to the Embassy. -—

that his participation in a Tourist Department approach to : we
American citizen W. E, JOHNSON on 5 January 1962 nad been con- ”
firmed by JOHNSON himself. Therefore, NOSENKO was told, much
of what he had told CIA about his own role in the Pushkin —
Street affair became untenable. NOSENKO's response to this
observation is described in Part V.F.3., which discusses
NOSENKO‘s approach to JOHNSON,

reese

Also during the February 1965 interrogaticns NOSENKO refused i
to sign the page of a protocol which read as follows: i

"I have been told by my interrogators that ABIDIAN's . 4
only visit to the Pushkin Street site took place on 30 Dec- . 3
ember 1961. Therefore, I was told that:

a. I could not have placed the surveillance _ .

ment in January 1962. .

c. The three month period in which the sur-
veillance post was watching the Pushkin Street site
did not expire until 30 March 1962 - more then two
weeks after I left for Geneva.

Thus I could not have known in June 1962 that the surveil- '
lance of the dead drop site t.ad failed to produce results
or that it had been discontinued."

Although he acknowledged having reported to CIA on his involve- i
ment with ABIDIAN as summarized in the protocol, NOSENKO said boas
the way in which the protocol was prepared made him "look silly." po 74

NOSENKO was questioned further during October 1966 concern- i i

ing ABIDIAN's visit~to- Pushkin Street. ~ NOSENKO reaffirmed that ~~
ABIDIAN was under special survejllance coverage throughout his
Moscow tour and that this surveillance detected his travel from
_the U.S. Embassy to Pushkin Street and back; he would date this

{7 "-"" only as “sometime in 1961," NOSENKO was asked whether KGB sur-

veillance had detected any unugual movements by ABIDIAN during

the period just preceeding his visit to the PENKXOVSKIY drop

site (a reference to hisi movements on 27 and 28 December 1961 ° :

: as described above). He replied that he knew definitely that — :

j ; surveillance had reported nothing unusual and added that

: ABIDIAN had not succeeded in losing the KGB’  surved lance at

any time during this period. ~

wens sebycindte

On 20 October 1966 NOSENKO was asked why, in his 5 opinion,
ABIDIAN had gone to Pushkin Street at the time he did.
,Sponse, he told CIA for the fi ¥
feerican touriat or délegation mesber had gone tothe Pushkin» ~
_ Street address and that it was the “opinion of the Second Chief -
Directorate” that this American had selected it as a dead drop
site,* it was thought that ABIDIAN. went there merely to check
the suitability of the. proposed site. L

When he was asked on 20 October 1966 whether -he had visited
the Pushkin Street address several days after ABIDIAN had been
seen there, as he had earlier said, NOSENKO replied: "I don't
remember. I do not want to say that I visited the dead drop. I.
don't remember now whether I visited it or not. It seems to me
that I visited it, but I don't remember. It seems that I visited
it with KOZLOV, but I cannot say 'yes,' and I cannot say ‘'no.'"

As previously indicated, NOSENKO said that on the seme day
ASIDIAN was observed on Pushkin Street (i.e., on 30 December
1961) the Chief of the KGB Surveillance Directorate, KOZLOV,
inspected the Pushkin Street building, The FBI had reported,

however, that KOZLOV was on TOY in the United States from . —— . _. 1

time, would appear to preclude the possibility of KOZLOV's having
gore to the dead drop site on the day NOSENKO Said he did.

Supervisor of Activities Against American Service Attaches ©

At the beginning of the interrogation session on 29
January 1965, NOSENKO was asked to list the duties he as-
sumed upon reporting to the U.S, Embassy Section in Jan-

uary 1969.

As he had on a number of earlier cccasions,

NOSENKO replied that he was given responsibility for the ~
supervision of code clerk operations, was made the KGB
case officer for American Security Officer John ABIDIAN
who was to arrive in the near future, and was charged

with the Second Chief Directorate file on the security of
the U.S. Embassy and his secticn's file ca the materials.

That “you are Deputy Chief of Section, but I
consider that you must also pay special atten-

make an approach to one of then. It's necessary
to work on this." KOVSEUX was in KLYPIN's
office and I remember also that he raised the
question: "0.K. He will supervi-e this kind
of work, but maybe he can also take the military.
All three attaches.” Well, KUYPIN did not say
yes and dic not say no. I couldn't say anything
because I had not begun; I didn’t know how auch
work this would involve. I couldn't say. And,
you see, KLYPIN saids “Let's try it a short
period of time.” It was that way. It was

decided that I:will supervise the code. clerks

and then the three attaches. And KOVSHUK took
the diplomats and a whole pile of work. But,
of course, in the absence of KOVSHUK I must
take everything and in my absence, KOVSHUK
must take everything. But later, 1,2,3 -- I

During interrogations on 20 October 1966, NOSENKO
changed his earlier statement that the only operational
file he held in the U.S, Embassy Section was that on
ABIDIAN, At the same time, he described a leave period
that he had not mentioned earlier. NOSENKO said: "When

S"HOSENKO had mentioned this earlier, on 18 June 1904 he was . a
Penns asked to list the names and functions of U.5. Embassy Sec : ae etch

the Navy while I was gettiag acquzinted with the section.
At the same time, the case officer DRANOV was retiring and
he handled only Naval officers. I didn't take the Army:

or Air Force.“

NOSENKO was asked again on 25 October 1966 why he -
was responsible only for the Baval Attaches during early
1960. He answereds “I took the files only on the Navy,

__but I was working on all of then.*

nm other contexts NOSEN aS Always equated custody .
of a file with case officer responsibilities. There-
fore, he seems to have indicated here. that for the
approximately two months when these files were in his

r Knowledge of the Target
a) Introduction |

:. His position and duties as Deputy Chief and sonetimes
Acting Chief gave NOSENKO access to, and required hin to
know, the extent of. the U.S. Embassy Section‘’s knowledge.
of its target. He has therefore been questioned at length :
by CIA about the locations and cccupents oz the Embascy !
offices as well as about the Embassy pergonnel whom the KGB . : : :
had identified as CIA officers. ‘The information from i
NOSENKO on these two topics is presented below,

cae si

(ii) Physical Premises

NOSENKO has said that fis knowledge of the physical
layout of the Embassy cerivesa both from his gencral super=
—--- -- =: visory function during 1260 and-196)° and from nis reapon=
| gibilities as the officially registerad custodian of the
‘KGB's file on the security of the Embassy, According to
NOSENKO, he received the latter from his chief, KOVSHUK,
when he arrived in the section in January 1960; shortly
thereafter he arranged by a phene sail to the Secretariat
of the Second Chief Directorate to have custody transferred ~
officially to his name from that of M.F, BAXHVALOV, his
predecessor as Deputy Chief of Section, NOSENKO explained

officer to remain official custodian of a file belonging
to the U.S. Embassy Section, even after leaving the American
Department, 80 long as he remained in the Seccnd Chief
Directorate. Until he turned this file over to GRYAZNOV
approximately during the pariod 25 to 28 December 1961, no
one else had access to it other than KOVSHUK, Chief of the
section, and GRYAZNOV and KCSOLAPOV, who shared the office

NOSENKO stated in February 1965 that he had never

studied the contents, nor nad he paid any special attention
-¢o this file. Since he would necessarily have been in a
position to know, NOSENKO also said he is certain that no
operational analysis or planning by himself cr others was
‘done on the basis of this file during his two years in the oo a
section. The file consisted of two volumes, one for the old . Ty
building on Mokhovaya Street and the second--about one inch

yom thick--concerning the new Embassy building on Chaykovskiy - wae,

: Street, which was occupied in 1953. It was used only for

reference purposes, for the KGB had concluded that it was

impoesible for a Soviet citizen to penetrate! the secure

areas. of the Embassy because.of the security precautions in

effect. Apart from these file-custodial duties, NCSENKO was

. generally interested in the floor plane of, the’ Embassy . by

_ Wwirtue of his position as Deputy. Chief of the section.

WOSENKO's knowledge of the Embassy premises is reflected in.

the CIA debriefing of February 1965, and these statements ©. -

areas were of special interest to the KGB. NOSENKO knew
no KGB employees who entered the secure areas curing

1960 or 1961 and had no personal contact with any of them.
He did not remember any information that such KGB erployees’
ever reperted to the KGB, except that Dmitriy I. KUKOLEV,
an electrician whom he personally handled in 1954-1955,

had observed antenna wiring in the attic; the details or
significance of the wiring were unknown to NOSENKO as of
1965.

NOSENKO personally pzaced some reports by KGB agents .
in the Embassy security file while he had custody of it. .
None of the infcrmation, he said, was interesting, im- wo.
portant, or useful enough for him to remember, and he
could not name the: agent sources of the KGB, In another
context and at another time, however, NOSENKO said he
had received a report from some agent (name unknown)
that there was a sign “Security Office" cn the office

NOSENKO did not study the Enbassy security pro-
cedures in detail and did not remerber where the classified ;
trash wes burned. He said that nothing could be done with i
this information operationally, because the trash was al- :
ways burned by a U.S. sergeant or a Marine guard ac@-
companied by an officer.**

The Embassy office or floor where any section was
located or any individual worked during the years 1960
and 1961 was not remembered by NOSENKO., This reply was
also given when he was asked about tha roons and floors
for the offices of the ambessador, the political officers,
ABIDIAN, and the code clerks.*** NOSENKO said that he
either knew these locations at the time he was Deputy
Chief of the section or could nave found them in the
in the monthly Embassy phone lists; the KGB received these
regularly from agent sources, and the lists gave office
numbers and phone numbers.****

¥ There never has been such a Sign} NOSENRO'S responsi-
bility for the KGB coverage of ABLIDIAN is discussed
in, Part V.E.3.d.. All Soviets who enter the top three
floors of the Embassy have a marine escort. : :

*® A check with two former Embassy security officers in-
dicates that there has never been such a regulation.
fhe trash is burned by the marine on duty who "in-
variably does it alone." One of the security officers a ; od
questioned said: "I can think of no reason why the Sov-
dets would think this to be the case, since whatever

_ collateral information they have on it would point to

, the truth." ; sae

so, . ta 1960 a “natal lic chanber® (acoustical room) arrived
at the Embassy for President Eisenhower's use-and for
secret conversations. NOSENKO was not certain where it was Mes
‘located or whether it was ever used, but he heard from an. . at
unknown source that in 1960-1961 meetings were held ina
secure room in the “Zone of Security.” He did not know any
of the technical details of this room.

The KGB accomplished only one theft of classified

material in any form from the U.S. Embassy during 1960

, and 1961. A charwoman (name or cryptonym not recalled),
who worked as an agent for the KGB officer Viktor BELOG-
LAZOV, stole a bag of papers from the office of the Naval
Attaches. Most of the papers were turn or crumpled. They.
included a draft of a report of tne Naval Attaches' sighting
of ships and factories while on a trip to Leningrad, Since
this report was of only routine interest to the KGB, NOSENKO
said, he was unable to recall any other details of tne theft, ;
including the date, except that tle charwoman was granted © ,
@ cash award. 3

(iii) CIA Personnel Under Embassy Cover %

According to NOSENKO, the Americans at the U.S, Embassy
of graatest counterintelligence intereat to the KGB section
were the identified CIA officers. When questioned on 2-
Septerber 1954 concerning his knowledge of intelligence por-
sonnel assigned to the Embassy in 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO
stated that the KGB immediately listed any officer associated
with the offices of U.S. Armed Forces Attaches as a member
of American Military Intelligence and any diplomat.as "suspect
American Intelligence,” the latter nctation always meaning
CIA. One of the tasks of the section was to determine which
of theses diplomats was the CIA “Resident*® (KGB nomenclature
for.Chief of Station), which were CIA case officers, and
which were the CIA agents or cooptees., The KGB knew that
code clerks would not be used to fulfill intelligence missions
and that the same probably held true for the Ambassador and
the Marine guards. NOSENKO on 25 February 1965 signed a pro=
, tocol which included his statement that, as Deputy Chief and .
occasional Acting Chief of the section, he would "necessarily
know whom the KGB knew or suspected to be a CIA officer jn the
Embassy.”

NOSENKO has been shown lists of the names of all “
ou. ..  «,», Amarican personnel assigned to the embassy during 1960 and 6
1961 and on a number of occasions has been asked to select ,
those known or suspected by the KGB to be CIA officers. The - oe
persons he so identified, together with his comments con- Co a
corning them were: : :

“Boris. KLOSSON: Considered to be the CIA *“Resident*
/ in Moscow during this period. NOSENKO did not know why
KLOSSON was considered as such but said: "Every officer ~ mo,
in the First [U.S. Embassy] Section thought he was the ee
Resident." KLOSSON may have taken David MARK's job, -
WOSENKO said, and MARK had been suspected of being the
CIA Resident on the basis of his behavior under KGB.._
, @urveillance and of his letter mailing.* ‘NOSENKO did.

not récall the names of KGB agents working specifically
against: KLOSSON and never read any agent or surveil- i
lance report indicating that KLOSSON was engaged in
Clandestine activity. NOSENKO did net know KLOSSON's
position: in the Embassy, where he had been previously
stationed, what trips he tcok inside the Soviet Union,
where he lived in Moscow, about KLOSSON's wife or
whether he had children with him in Moscow, anything
about his personal life, the namos of close American
friends and his Soviet contacts, “I didn't read the
file" on KLOSSON, NOSENKO said on 3 February 1965.
The responsible KGB officer, A.M. MIKHAYLOV, °was
reading [the file]. I can't tell you why [we believed
FLOSSON was the CIA Resident]. There was opinicn--his
previous position, attitude. Little, little details.
I don't remember.°*

“John ABIDIAN: Consicered to be a CIA officer
on the basis of his conduct as a U.S. Departnrent of
State security officer in conection wits Sremier

_*George WINTERS: Known to be a CIA cfficer an
was given special attention because of his operational
activity in the POPOV case.** WINTERS was in perscnal
contact with KOVSHUK, who used the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs as cover. The KGB case officer responsible
for covering WINTERS was V.A. KUSKOV.

eSteve WASHENKO: Known to be a CIA officer. As
far as NOSENKO was aware, the KGB identified WASHENKCG
as a CIA officer on the basis of his mailing one or
two lettersto KGB-controlled double agents in the Baltic
area. In addition, from a KGB microphone he was over-
heard dictating an intelligence report shortly after he
xeturned from a trip in the USSR.

Lewis BOWDEN: Suspected of being a CIA officer,

viewed in Part VI.D.7.C.

*** The CHEREPANOV document: which sets forth a KGB plan for
operations against BOWDEN, lists several reasons why he
was believed to be an FSI representative in the Embassy.
NOSENKO, when reading this document in Geneva in February
1964, concurred in this opinion; he referred to BOWDEN
as FBI on later occasions also. Sea Part VI.D.e7.c. on

- Richard FUNKHOUSER: Suspected cf being a CIA - :
officer because he is a specialist on the Soviet union,
particularly economics. NOSFNKG did net remember the
names of any agents working against FUNKHOUSER nor any
derogatory information concerning him.

- William HORBALY: Suspected of being a CIA case
officer* because the KGB heard him, by means of micro-
phones in the Embassy, discussiny a report he had
written, or dictating it, about his cbservations on
a trip he haé taken in the Soviet Union. NOSENKO said
that he did not know the names cf agents working
against WORBALY or whether the agents obtained deroga-
tory information concerning him. As far as NOSENKO
knew, there had been no operaticnal approach to or -
recruitment. of HORBALY. 1

Of the seven U.S. Embassy officers designated by

NOSENKO as known or suspected CIA 5 onnel, thHree--WINTERS, 4
- WASHENKO, and HORBALY--were in fact CIA officers. When ?
- HORBALY was first assigned to Moscow, however, he was

detached from overt employment as an economics analyst in

CIA. In January 1962 he severed his connecticns with CIA

to become a full member of the Foreign Agricuitural Ser-

vice of tra Department of Agriculture When HORBALY first

arrived in Moscow he openly discus the fact that he had come

to the Embassy from CIA. While in Mcscow he nad no connection

with or knowledge of CIA clandestine activities. WASHENKO was

similarly detached from overt employment as an economic analyst

with CIA wnen he was assigned to Moscow, but was coopted by

CIA for limited operational support activity, chiefly mailing

agent letters. After his return from Moscow he reverted to

his overt CIA employment. John ABLDIAN was a State Department

officer coopted by CIA; although not a CIA staff employee, he

was for all intents the CIA "Resident" in Moscow from Febru-

ary 1960 until November 1961. The remaining three--KLOSSON,

BOWDEN and FUNKHOUSER--had no affiliation with CIA.

: as such was subsequently found to have been known to the
KGB before their arrival in the Soviet Union. In addition, Ce rated
one officer (William MORELL) was openly identified as a CIA
employee to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs before
arriving in Moscow. Furthermore, Francis STEVENS (see Page
374) reported having been. asked by one of the’ two KGB offi-
cers trying to recruit him whether MORELL was a CIA employee;
when STEVENS replied that he did not know, the KGB officer
stated: “He openly says he does." Another officer (G. Stan-

to information on the agenda and participants for these. talks,

. MAHONEY arrived. in Moscow on-4d October 1960 as the
Assistant General Services Officer at the U.S, Embassy. —
His specific CIA mission there was to support the handling
of PENKOVSKIY inside the Soviet Union. MAHONEY lived in
America House. From the start cf his tour he was active in
his attempts to familiarize himself with Moscow and he
frequently toured various areas of the city on foot. In
checking locations connected with the PENKOVSKIY case,
MAHONEY went to the Pushkin Street dead drop location on
two occasions during ‘November and December 1960, and he
‘made a thorough examination of the dead drop itself as
well as of its related signal site on-21 January 1961.
Throughout, MAHONEY was subjected to intensive KGB surveil-
lance. In a report dated 25 October 1960, ABIDIAN com-
mented on this as follows: "I find this type of coverage
(five surveillants on a recent trip to the barier shop)
completely out of character with that which is usually
given a new arrival of similar rank. Uy only inference
is that the KGB has at least strong suspicions of MAHONEY's
primary rote [CIA officer]. As for surveillance on my-
self, it continues to be eccasional and extremely discreet."

George BLAKE, the KGB penecration of MI-6, was arrested
in London on 14 April 1961. In his confession he said that
he had passed the KGB a master list of the names of persons
connected with the joint U.S.-British project with which
MAHONEY had been connnected in Frankfurt, as well as other
materials on this project. On this tasis, “AHONEY was
relieved shortly thereafter of further duties connected with
support of the PENKOVSKIY operation; he was withdrawn fron
Moscow in September 1961, less than a year after his arrival.

CIA records indicate that GARBLER was detailed to CIA
by the Navy in April 1952 and served CIA under Naval cover
gin Berlin from January 1953 until July 1955. In the fall
‘ot 1955, he resigned his naval commission, and in May 1956
he was assigned as a CIA officer to the U.S. Embassy in
Stockholm. GARBLER served there until August 1959 in the
cover position of Second Secretary and Political Officer (FSR).
On 3 June 1961, he returned to active duty with the Navy,
and on 31 August 1961 his appointment was announced as
Assistant Naval Attache to Mescow, with the rank of Commander.
In. September 1961 his official biographic data was forwarded
to the office of the Soviet Naval Attache in Washington, who
had requested this information, and the same month GARBLER
made an official call at the Soviet Embassy. GARBLER arrived
ip Moscow on 29 November 1961. He was the CIA Chief of
Station there.

Prior to his affiliation with CIA, GARBLER served in
Korea and there was acquainted with George BLAKE. In April
1960 GARBLER was a participant in joint CIA-MI-6 discussions

"gl Electronic Operations Against the U.S. Exbassy_

(i) Introduction ~

NOSENKO had. three basic pieces of information on KGB .
audio and other electronic operations against the U.S. Em- ak.
bassy in Moscow: The presence of microphones in the :
chancery bufiding, the absencé of audio-technical dovices
in the north wing of the Embassy, and the exidtence ofa
beam which monitors and jams transmissions from the Embassy.

Thesé are discussed separately below. Except for knowing :
that a resonant cavity (wireless) “microphone -had been found ,

in the American Ambassador's residence in 1953, NOSENKO

said he was unaware of audio surveillance devices and tech-

niques (other than the chancery nicrophones) in use against

the Embassy, nor did he know of any material produced by

such measures. NOSENKO told CIA on 14 May 1964 that, to | . . =
“the bést of his knowledge, there were no wireless micro- : -
phones (i.e., carrier transmitters and radio transmitters)

in the Embassy.* His information on KGB electronic opera-

tions against this target dated mainly from the period when

he was Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, American :
Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate, in 1960-1961 and 3
derives from his special responsibilities in this period; a
from his 1953-1955 service in the American Department, NO- : .
SENKO said, he learned only that audio installations : 4

existed.

(41) Microphones in the Chancery : %
t

Frequenily described by NOSENKO as his most important

information, the microphones in the chancery building were

first mentioned by him during the 1962 meetings in Geneva.
In these and subsequent debriefings NOSENKO reported in de- |. i
“tail on the ways in which he acquired this information, on H
i the number and locations of the microphones, the quality of |
{ reception, and the value of production. He has not given |

the date when the. microphones became operative, but pre-
sumed (in agreement with the KGB defector GOLITSYN) that
-they Were installed prior to 1953, when the chancery was oc-
cupied by U.S. Government representatives.** Of the 16
. wicrophones listed by NOSENXO, he has stressed the impor
‘ ’ tance of the one in the office of the Minister Counsellor,
. : the existence of which was earlier reported by GOLITSYN and
subsequently confirmed by technical investigations. In

*NOSENKO stated that the KGB knew the identity of American

‘phones whenever any.of them arrived at the Embassy. Since

Althougk the microphones produced a great deal of politi- —

eal intelligence, .NOSENKO said,-he found nothiog worthwhile

for use against U.S. code clerks or others of operational

interest to him.** All pertinent details from NOSENKO and

other sources on the microphone svstem in the chancery . |

(a) NOSENKO's Sources :

wie

Nearly all of NOSFNKO'S knowledge about the microphone
system in the chancery building was, he said, derived from
two circumstances: Fitst, his responsibility as Deputy
= ? Chie? of the KGB's U.S. Embassy Section, for receiving and
oe ee . disseminating transcripts. of conversations there; and second,
a special meeting which he attended in his dual capacity as ~
Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section and custodian of
the microphone information. Additional information was ob-
tained by NOSENKO in 1962 and 1963 from G.I. GRYAZNOV, his
former subordinate and his successor as Deputy Chief of the
Section. In several discussions with GRYAZNOV dufing this
period NOSENKO learned that some of the microphones were
dead while others had become less efficient since NOSENKO's
reassignment to the Tourist Departrent in January 1962. :
NOSENKO's statements concerning his major sources: 6f ‘infor~
mation on the microphones are presented in chronological

“We are listening to everything the military attaches
say in Moscow, the Military, Navy and Air Force Attaches,"
< NOSENKO said on 11 June 1962. "All the reports go through
me. I read them....Only a limited group of people read
these reports. They are all in the First Department of the
’ Second Chief Directorate. Who are they? The Chief of the
Department (we don't give them to his deputies), the Chief

Sometimes we report to GRIBANOV things we consider important.

partment and then I underlined with a pencil what was neces-
sary and gave it back to them [the Second Special Department,
OTU]. They collected it. I signed a receipt that I had
received it from them and they gave me a receipt when I
returned it. And then they gave me extracts. From these

extracts alcne one cannot tell where the material cane froa,

but from the report one realizes that the Americans are
being listened to. It is necessary to have these extracts
to place in the files. We have a file on each person working
in the Embassy, the so-called delo-formulyar [developmental
file]. We keep one on every Embassy “employe .

During the second of the 1964 series of meetings in
Geneva, on 24 January, NOSENKO took a number of notes from
his wallet. Pointing to one of them, he said: "This piece
of paper was kept in my operational file and it represents
the statistics for the years 1960-1961, listing those micro-
phones which are actively used in monitoring conversations
in the U.S, Embassy." This list named eleven offices and
apartments in the chancery. which contained microphones.
When asked whether he had copied the list from records or
had-drawn it up from memory, NOSENKO explained that it came
from an operational review of what "listening points we had
in the U.S. Embassy."

A detailed explanation of his acquisition of the written

' list was supplied by NOSENKO on 14 May 1964:

Question: How did this list come into your hands? What
; caused you to write it?. .

some of the chancery microphones and of assigning these re-
leased positions to Vladimir {patronymic unknown]. PETROV, =... - —.. -
Chief of the American Department's section for work against
American tourists and delegates suspected of being con-
nected with American Intelligence; PETROV had earlicr re-
quested English-language monitoring positions fron the Chief
of the Englisb-Language Section of the OTU’s Second Special
Department but had been told that all such interpreters were
already engaged on pricrity targets. At the neeting KOVSHUK

to decide which rooms offered-information of Little value
and which monitoring positions could: be released to PETROV.
KOVSHUK drew up a list of the Embassy offices and apartnents mo i

of lesser importance. At the end of the neeting, KOVSHUK ;
gave the list to NUSENKO, who retained it in his safe until
bringing it to CIA in 1954. NOSENKO has added nothing fur-
ther on the locations of microphones in the chancery building,
and much of his information concerning the quality and value
of the production by these microphones cane from this : j

Since his defection, NOSENKO has spoken further on his
responsibilities in connection with the daily transcripts
received from the Second Special Department. He said on
14 May 1964: “All the materials after they were read and

this was put in the individual file, but anyone who read

it would ‘never know where it came from. He wouldn't know
that it came from mikes....KOVSHUK and I read all of this.
From this we gave information to those who needed it, de-
pending on their interest. If there was something inter-—

something interesting he could take it ‘and give it to GRI-

A protocol signed by NOSENKO in 1965 states: "One of
my duties as Deputy Chief, First Section, First Department,

to appropriate case officers the production from microphones -

NOSENKO's Information :

first consulting with him.}] "Well, because vou are such ~ .

we are listening to these six points. This is our biggest
secret. Only a few people know this. I was Deputy Caief

of the section and received this information. I decided
what to give the Chief of Pepartment and what not to give
hin, Go you understand? This is to say nothing about the
other departments and the [U.S,i Embessy Section itself."

12 June 1962: “We lost the microphone in the private
residence of tie Ambassador. This was not THOMPSON, but the

: one before him. BOHLEN was there then. We once had some-

H thing there, but you found the [Great] Seal where it was
located. But in the Embassy itscl., in the Ambassador's
office, we have nothing. ‘Ise one we hear now is {Minister
Counsellor] FREEKS. Bill FREERS, in particular, walks around
his office and dictates. All this is recorded. Well, this
is important material."

14 June 1962: "When I was Deputy Chief of the American 3
Embassy Section T receive reports on the microphone material i
daily. If there was something important in it, I reported ‘
to the Chief of the department. The rest KOVSHUK and I
read and then distributed to the workers the parts that con-
cerned them. Well, the workers who were operating against
the three attaches knew about this [microphone] equipment....
Nothing was received from the code room. These machines
were working and there were no conversations. He was sitting
alone and there was nothing. [NOSENKO is evidently describing
the military code room.}....There is a point there from which
we hear the Agricultural Attache. But there in nothing
there. They talk about what interests them in the field of
.- agriculture. Nothing interesting.”

24 January 1964: The late 1960/early 1961 List which

_ KOSENKO brought to CIA (see above) showed that the following
; offices and apartments in the chancery contained microphénes:

"Military Code Roon; .

"State Department Code Room and Telctype Office;

“Apartments of FREERS, HOWGHTON, URBAN and NEILSEN;

"Eighth Floor Bar ‘Marines)"

Altcgether, sixteen spaces are listed, but of thes. NOSENKO
said that the microphon+ in one (the Marine bar) had never
worked and that nothing of importance was jearned: from the
microphones in the four Eab y apartments. This leaves
eleven; when presenting tt list to CLA, NOSENKO said that
while he was in the U.S, Embassy Section, “there were a total
of eleven listening posts.” (in dis sing the late 1960
or early 1961 meeting at which KOVSHURK and KLYPI* received
the microphone coverage, NOSENKO said on 14 May 1954 that
it was decided to celease c microphone. positions in the
GLEYSTEEN office, tne EO! BROWN office, the State De-
partment code room and the teletype office. ‘This would
leave a total of cight ‘listening posts."')

14 May 1964: Questioned on the total number of micro-
phones in the U.S, Embassy, NOSENKO said that "mary" were
installed in the chancery building pefore the Americans moved
in, but that he did not know how many were instailed in all,
how many wee@e in any one of the rooms included in KOVSHUK's
list, or where they were lo.ated in specific rooms. He
did recall that nost of the microphones were placed in the
outside wall, the wali rearest Cnaykovskiy Street, as most of
the offices faced tunis street and the placement of the micro-
phones near the outer wall would make it more difficult for
American technicians to find them if they examined only the

inner walls.

January 1965: NOSENKO volunteered that there were no
fixed microphones in America House, the residence of enlisted
men at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. He said that there was
discussion during 1960 and 1961 of using the KCB agents
employed there to place temporary audio devices for one or
two days at a time in the rooms of the Americans as well as
im the Embassy garage. These plans were yetoed, however, be-
cause such devices are too easily found. For the same rea=

_ gon, NOSENKO said, there was no attempt made in this period

to place temporary devices in Spasso House (tha Ambassador's
residence) or an the apartments of such Embassy officers

og John ABIDIAN. [he KGB was “afraid that they will be
@etected and that there will be a scandal.”

In 1956 .@ sensitive source yholding a senior position
in the KGB siBmitted a vrit report to the U.S. Ambassador
in Moscow with “he cautionary mark: “Do not speak about
this information in the rooms of the American Embassy."
The report itself contains a portion reading as follows:
"Because all rvoms in tue American Embassy in Moscow are
being monitored by the Keb, T strongly ask that there be no
conversations and discussions conesrning this information
in the American Embassy. Tie flap involving the American
direction.findisy specialiat=* in Stasingrvad dusing the
sunmer of 1955 was organized hy the KG because conversa-
tions were overheard in th rooms of the American Embassy.
As you know, as a vesult of this flap, the KGB seized valu-
able directien..finding caudpment from the American intelli-
gence officers. The KGB did pot possess this type of
valuable equipment, and 1t would Lave been necessary for
Soviet techuicians to xork and «experiment for a tong time
in order to acquire such valuable equipment. The listening
devices are so skitifuliy anstailed in the walls, floors,
and ceilings of the roows of tne Americar Embassy that it
is impossible to fang chem, Cven with special-perpose instru-
ments."

e

GOLITSYN, who defected in late 1961, reported the exis-
tence of a microptione in the office of the Minister Counsellor
and said tat many wore had been installed in *the chancery
prior io 1953, %:OL125YN was deoriefed in early 1962 and
his information or this subject was disseminated within the
U.S. Government appeoaxivately two weeks before NOSENKO'S
initial contact wits CIA.> GOFLISYN said he had learned of
the microphone in the Minister Counsellor's office when by
chance he happencd to sce a particuiar document in an office
at KGB Headquarters. According to COLIITSYN, during one of his
visits to tre American I. partment in 1960s* he heard and saw

*This is a referencs to tne arrest of U.S. Military Attaches
BENSON, MULE, and SHROUD ard the seizure of sensitive elec-~
tronic cquipment they had witr them in Stalingrad in the
summer of 1955. NOSENKO reported that the KGB seizure of

this equipment was based on information obtained from nicro-
phones in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. See Part V.C.3.b. (viii).

**#GOLITSYN has reported that he visited the U.S. Embassy Sec-
tion of the American Department on a number of occasions in
the spring of 1960 as pact of his preparation for assignment
to Helsinki in July of ‘that yeav; he has aiso said that he
returned on temporary assignment to Moscow and again con-
sulted with U.S. Embassy Section officers in December 1960.
With regard to the latter visits, however, GOLITSYN's pass-
port and CIA travel records indicate that ke was in Moscow on
temporary duty for two weeks in January 1961 and that he is
therefore a month off in his estimate of when these visits
took place. On this basis it appears that by his statement
that this incident occurred in 1960 {he has not been more

_specific), he could have been referring to either his visits

to the American Department in the spring of 1960 or his visits
in January 1961. an

GOLITSYN was in the office, the Chief of the American De-
partment ordered all personnel present to search for these
papers, and all the KGB officers searched again through
their files, without success. GOLITSYN noted a large’ num-
ber of reports with red stripes across their covers, indi- -
cating that they were the property of the Operational Teche
nical Directorate. The only office in the U.S, Embassy that
GOLITSYN recalled being mentioned in connection with this

chancery building for the presence of microphones in the
spring of 1964. The results have been described in the
damage report submitted by the USIB Security Committee on
7 October 1964: "On 23 April 1964, a low-impedance dynamic
microphone and associated seven-inch probe tube were dis-
covered in the wall benind a radiator in Room 1008 of the
Chancery of the U.S, Embassy in Moscow. The cable to this
microphone was traced to a major cable run which lay several
inches under the outside surface of the cast face of the
Chancery. This major cable run consisted of a single
twenty (20)- pair and a single thirty (30) pair, lead-sheathed
audio cable which ran along the cast face of the Chancery
to the rcof area of the North Annex of the Embassy. At
this point, these cables were spliced into aA one hundred and

*On 28 January 1965 NOSENKO volunteered an account of the

loss of one of the intercept reports which the U.S. Embassy

Section had received from the Second Special Department of

the Operational Technical Directorate ‘in 1960 or 1961.”

This document, according to NOSENKO, was “one of the reports ' .
with [Minister Counsellor] FREERS dictating"; as 2 result of H
its loss, "the month of December, the whole month, the U.S.

Embassy Section was in a turmoil" searching for the document. ‘
The month-long search and investigation was unsuccessful, : :
however, and. in the end, the case was closed with the con- :
clusion that the document had probably been burned inadver-
tently, without a record of destruction having been drawn up.
In this account NOSENKO appears to date the incident in Decem<
ber 1960, which approximates GOLITSYN's secend series of
visits to the U.S. Embassy Section (and duplicated GOLITSYN's i(
erroneous estimate of when these visits took place). NOSENKO |
has never reported that GOLITSYN was present in the offices i
of the U.S. Embassy Section during the search for this docu- i
ment and, in fact, has denied that GOLITSYN visited the section
either in the spring of 1960 or in late 1960 or January 1961.

. The only visit by GOLITSYN to the U.S. Embassy Section reported a)
by NOSENKO was one in the spring or summer of 1961, at which ,
time NOSENKO claims to have been om leave; GOLITSYN vas not

can reasonably be presumed to be in apartment 6J based on
the symmetry of the known installations. The microphones
located were situated so that all microphenes and probes i ;
were behind radiators. The microphons system discovered i
covered every outside room on floors six through ten,. with
the exception of thuse offices with decors entering onto
balconies and when exterior building constructions were ad-
jacent to cutside wall sections bearing radiators."

The first microphone found was in Koom 1608, in what
is now the Army Finance office and which in 1960-1961 was
the office of the Military Attache, where NOSENKO reported
a microphone to be. All other microphones were ultimately
traced from this discovery. There were microphones in all
rooms identified by NOSENKO, and in others besides. Two of
the latter were inoperative when found~-one in to Ambassa-
dor's office where NOSENKO said no conversations were being
heard in 1960-1961 and the other in the Security Office where
NOSENKO eaid there was none. The damage report concluded
that all the microptones were installed before the U.S.
Government took possession of the chancery building in 1953,

(c) Receptivity and Audibility of Microphones

NOSENKO made the following evaluations of the quality
of intercept received from the chancery microphone installa-
tions:

11 June 1962: "They are dving, the microphones, and
we cannot do anything about it, because we can't get into
the Embassy {to make new installations]. In that respect
your Embassy and the british Embassy are the only cnes we
can't get into.”

14 June 1962: "The most interesting materials, of .
course, ere irom the...{Note: one or tvo words or the tape
are unintelligible here; from earlier and subsequent remarks,
particularly one on 24 January 1964 (see below), it is clear
that NOSENKO is snpeakiig of the microphone in the Minister
Counsellor's office.} And I tell you honestly that it is
becoming increasingly difficult to work with this. The
Shayba {microphone;, as we call them, is fading and only two

nree people are able to make out what is being said.
That is, the tape sounds as if somewhere far, far away,
somewhere in the cellar, someone is spearing in a whisper.
It is very difficult to hear, very difficult when it is
fading. But, what can you do? They tell us categorically
anc directly--KUZMIN, the Chief of the section of the Second
Special Departnent responsible for this, tells us that
soon we will not have anything there. There are a great
nunber of microphon:s there, but they don't work. I know
that there are about 20 microphones there that don't work.
They have all gone deaf."

24 January 1964: ‘Now, we also listened to the code
room and the teletype office, but we could never get any-
thisg out of the teletype office because of interference

probably speaking of machine noise}. Fron this point
pointing at the list, but not stating which microphone he
was speaking about] the reception became progressively
weaker until it finally stopped: evidently it wore out.
Yes, there was another point in the bar on the 8th floor.
This one never worked even though it was installed. Thus,
out of the eleven points, nine were working...[NOSENKO then
referred to information he learned in 1962 and 1963, after
leaving the U.S. Embassy Section.] GRYAZNOV said that the
equipment is deteriorating and they are only getting snatches
of conversation and that in a year or two they will be com-
letely inoperative. GRIBANOY is insisting on getting to
Precruiting code clerks at all costs."

“1 7-92 Jpgnuary:1964: “Here in HORBALY's and BROFN's room
perey*e of thé Agricultural Attaches], there is no acoustical
sic] and nothing comes from here. I'11 come back to this,
but they complained that they‘re not getting anything. {These
microphones were installed] when this building was being
built. It wasn’t later after you had moved into the building,
but when the building was under construction...[NOSENKO was
asked whether more or fewer than nine microphones are now’ cur-
rently active.] It couldn't be more, anyhow."

14 May 1964: Very interesting information was heard

., from WinYster Counsellor FREERS' office, NOSENKO said, “but
for the last years, even in 1960 and 1961, it was very

difficult to hear. I was sitting with [S.G.] DMITRIYEV
[Deputy Chief of the English-language Section of the Second
Special Departmeat] aad they toid me how difficult it was.
The mike was dying. Only very experienced interpreters
were sitting on this. They listened 10, 15, even 20 times
to the same place [on the tape|....{ After 1961] GRYAZNOV
was telling me that they vere getting almost nothing from
this point. [He said this] in 1962, 1963, I was thinking
you had given a command [had cautioned FREERS]. We were
getting almost nothing. I heard this from GRYAZNOV several
times in 1963, Thr. mikes wore working not bad at all in
1960 and 1961 in the attache rooms--Navy, Air Force...

I don't know [how recepticén was in 1962). I know only that
GRYAZNOV was te®ling me in 1962 and 1963 that they were getting
Little, little, and almost nothing. He said we are losing
everything. We have no materials. We have little, little
pieces, but nothing...in generai | from all of the micro-
phones]. NOSENKO then speculated that one reason for this

was the fact that the Americans in the E:bassy were not

saying anything significant, but he said he did not know

this to be the case. Speuking of the microphone in GLEYSTEEN's
office, te said: “There was something heard. In 1960 and

1961 it was working [ remenber. Reception was good but

there was no secret information. The mike in HORBALY's

room was gond in 1960 and 1961....1960 and 1961--good re-
ception." According to NOSENKO, reception was good from

the State Department code and teletype room “only always

the sounds of [teletype] machines. In 1960 and 1961--machines
only....Reception was good when conversation came through.

I don’t know {svout reception in 1962 and 1963]....Reception
was good {from the military code room] in 1950 and 1961."

On-site tests made by American technicians after the
1964 discoveries detezrmined that the following microphones
in the chancery (the occupants listed are those as of Decem~
ber 1960) were inoperative or unintelligible, but the USIB
damage report emphasized that it had not been possible to
determine how long these microphones had neen inoperative:

~one microphone in the apartment of the senior Naval

Attache;

-three microphones in the apartment of the senior Air
Attache;

~one micrephone in the apartment of the Economic Counsel-
lor;

-the microphone in the office of the Publications Pro-
ecurement Officer;
-The microphone in the Marine bar;
=the microphone in the Internal Affairs office
-the microphone in the Ambassador's office;
-the microphone in the office of the Security Officer;
=the microphone in the office of the Chief of Chancery;
=the microphone in the office of the Air Attache;
=the microphone in the office of the Assistant Air At-
tache;
=the microphone in the office of the Assistant Naval
-' Attaches;
‘ ethe oicrophone in the Navy administrative office;
-the microphone in the Air Force administrative office.

made from twelve selected micrcphones in 1964 indicate that

the microphone in the office oecupied by the Minister Counsel-

lor in 1960 was capable of producing tapes of "high intelli-

gibility" as of 1964. The 1964 tests of tne microphones in

the military and State Departuent code rooms in the office ;
of the Naval Attache also produced recordings of high inteili- i
gibility. As pointed out velov, hovever, the possible pro-
duction by the code room microphones would have been sharply
reduced by the installation of acousticai rcoons during 1962. '

targets interest then--always....They chatter sonetimes.
-Some of the things they say are surprisixzg [from the point
of view of security]. They discuss, among other things,
where to go, what to see, what to take with them--electronic
equipment or not. And we are hunting for this electronic
equipment end now have permissica, if ve are absolutely cer~
tain that one of your people is taking electronic apparatus
with him on an intelligence trip outside Moscow, to teke it,
to steel it. We now have authorization to take any necessary
steps to steal it. Because you now have improved your
equipment. We stole some equipment in Stalingrad in 1955,
but now you have better apparatus....Wnat do we do [when we
know the attaches are taking special. equipment;? Well, they
are getting ready to go aad we hear that such-and-such data
interests them. We give them disinformation; we rake them
think, for example, that there are rockets there. And there's
absolutely nothing there, understand? Absolutely nothing.

We make it appear on the radio [by spurious transmissions]

. that there are rockets there; we even have patrols standing
there and everything....They talk about interesting things,
but never in my life have I heard a conversation about agent

operations, not once." .

12 June 1962: [Speaking again about coverage of the U.S.
Service Attaches] "They say: ‘Today, let's go to such-and-.
such a place.' They go to the military attache, the two —
assistants, and say: ‘This region is-.interesting. They have
something there.* We know it at once. I personally tele- -
phone surveillance at once and tell tre Chief of the depart~
ment to come at once. He arrives and I say: ‘Throw in
three, four, five brigades [surveillance teams].' We work 2l- . :
most openly against the attaches..,.!REERS, Bill FREERS, in — :
particular, walks around in his office and dictates, All . Sy
this is recorded. Well, this is very important material. We : ae
do not know the cipher, but he dictates Top Secret and Con~
fidential cables [in the clear}. We receive the clear text: fo
and decide at once whether there is anything serious there or rae
not. If we decide that this must be reported to the [KGB] See
Chairman immediately, GRIBANOV may call him right away."

24. January 1964: "Now, ve also listened to the code =

Because of interference: [ type ‘machine noise} We: didn’t. ©
get much out. of the [military] code room;.we.coutd hear [the .

‘“@ll recorded, and we turned it- over at-on o the Eighth

14 May 1964: Discussing the list drawn up by KOVSHUK
and the decision to withdraw U.S, Embassy:.Section require~ |

ments for full-time ‘monitoring of certain microphones, NO-

' SENKO quoted KOVSHUK: "We are getting information f: ‘6m the
rooms of the attaches, the Counsellor, and the Agricultural
Attache. The flats {Embassy apartments]--no; the bar--
nothing. Of course, I know it is necessary to keep the room
of the code clerks in spite of the fact that there is seldom
anything received except several numbers. The code clerk is
saying aloud several numbers, But the flats you can take,
not permanently, but temporarily." NOSENKO then continued:
"“KOVSHUK said to give them these flats....But you see,
nothing was going on in these flats. They weren't speaking
or we:2 talking about steak and eggs. There was nothing
of interest from an operating standpoint, Sonotimes we
heard there would be guests. Okay. There is a possibility
to hear something. -In this case we would call DMITRIYLY
[English-language Section of Second Special Departnent] and
say: 'This evening, this day, this flat. Meype we will
get something.' The mikes were working not bad at all in
1960 and 1961 in the attache rooms--Naval, Air Force. When
the man was alone we heard nothing. but when two.or three
men were sitting in the rooms, the assistants, we-heard.

For example, when they returned from a trip ard discussed
what they had seen or when they were preparing for a trip....
But we heard nothing about agents." .

Later on this occasion the following diagogue took
place:

NOSENKO: GRYAZNOV was telling me in 1962 and 1963 that

SS they were getting little, little, almost nothing.
He said we are losing everything. We have no
materials. We have little, little pieces, but
nothing.

Question: Was he talking about the Military Attaches?

NOSENKO: In general, I think they were speaking very

little. God knows. Then, you see, we were thinking

they were taking new measures. GRYAZNOV, -
FEDOSEYEVY, and KQVSHUK considered that there vas
& room-in-a-room--a room {acoustic} for the
meeting.

Question: When did you first hear about the room-inside-the-

, room? by
NOSENKO: First it was known when, I think, Eisenhover. was

NOSENKO: At State, yes. Only always the sounds of machines
in 1960 and 1961. Machines only. Three times
during these two years maybe somebody said one
phrase or ono of. the guys said several numbers.

Question: Woat about the military [code] area’

“NOSENKO: The reception was good. He [STORSBERG] seldom

spoke. Sometimes he repeated numbers to himself.
And sometimes a mechanic of code machines cane
to him, a military guy, a sergeant (Willian
HURLEY, an Army Warrant Officer]. They said two.
or three phrases. "Did you check this?" "Yes."
“This side good." Et cetera.

Question: In all this time that you read all this material,
—— there must have been something that impressed
you as extremely valuable.

NOSENKO: Extremely valuable--nothing. A little was in-
teresting from FREERS' room. It was given to the
special group of GRIBANOV, They were writing
special information to the [KGB] Chairman to the
{CPsu} Central Committee. There were political
questions, for example. .

26 January 1985: - The following is taken from an inter- ~~”

rogation protocol signed by NOSENKO: "I regularly reviewed |

- all of the transcripts from microphones in the American

Embassy for a period of approximately two years, from Janu-
ary 1960 to January 1962. The following is the only infor-
mation which I can remember as being important, interesting
or operationally useful to the KGB:. cree ..

. was of such importance that special reports were
= written to the Central Committee of the CPSU. How~-
ever, I cannot remember ary specific incidents or :
events which these cables reported nor any specific
_ evaluations or recommendations made in these cables. .

b. -Also from the microphone in the Minister
Counsellor's office, I resenber that he dictated fitness
reports (kharakteristiki) on about twelve officers in
the EmbasSy. I canfot Femerber who any of these offi-
cers were or any dctails from the reports. There was
nothing in these reports which was interesting or
useful to the KGB.

c. From the microphone in tne Military Attache's
office I remember that the Military Attaches regularly
discussed plans for trips within the USSR and the tar-
gets that they wanted to cover. They also discussed
the results .of these trips after their return. How-
ever, I cannot remember any information about speci-
fic trips planned oy specific Military Attache per-
sonnel or any specific targets that they planned to
cover or any specific results from any trip. I do not
remember any specific operetionar activity taken by the
organs of the KGB against Military Attaches on trips
within the USSR which was based on information obtained
from this microphone. There was no «nteresting, impor-
tant, or useful information about the personal or pro-
fessional lives or avout the vulnerabilities of anyone
in the Military Attache's office (Army, Navy, and Air)
obtained from this microphone.

d. I remember that from the microphones in the
State Department code room occasionally a code clerk
would read numbers. These numbers were only of inter-
est to the Eighth Directorate (Communications and Crypto-
logy) of the KGB. I do not remember any conversations
from this microphore. There was no information from
this microphone on any of the code clerks which was
interesting, important, or useful to the U.S. Embassy
Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate,
‘KGB.

. During the approximately two years in which I daily reviewed
Ee the production from all the microplones in the American
Embassy I do not remember any information on any American in
the Embassy which was interesting, important, or useful to

Theodore F. HOFFUAN, arny Attache in Moscow from May
1959 to May 1961, has been interviewed concerning tae micro-
phone discoverias. (In the spring of 1961, Colonel HOFFMAN ?
was succeeded by Colozel URBAN as Army Attache.) While in
Moscow, Colonel HOFFMAN occupied room 1008, where the first
microphone wag found and his statements below relate to
matters presumed to be of general and specific interest to !
the U.S, Embassy Section during the period when NOSENKO
claims to have been its Deputy Chief.*

; “James H., STORSBERG {military code clerk] was
dating a foreign rational, 1 believe a secretary in
the British Embassy, nawe not recalled. On one or

- two occas{/ons, he was needed either to decode or to
encode for dispatching a message and was not evail-
able. He would be off with his girl friends, and we
couldn't find him. He was verbally reprimanded in my
office in regard to the two incidents of absenteeism.

We also discussed the importance of hts keeping me
informed of the conditions, personality problems,

that misht occur in the America House or the America
House club. All discussions were conducted in my
office.

“In May or June 1961, James C, KEYSERS [military
code clerk} was found to have allowed one or more
male members of...a U.S. ice review entertainment group
touring the Bloc countries to spend the night in his H
room at America House. He was suspected of homosexual i
activities, and he admitted to me being a participant
in homosexual activities. I believe these admissions

cated on the ninth floor of the Embassy. I gave }

{Summing up] "To be ‘perfectly..frank, I would ~
assume that...some of our modus operandi, some of our
targets, some of the results, and @ll oy our personal
weaknesses were compromised. _Tnis is not a very de-
finite answer; however, it is the best estimate I can

make."

In ite general introduction, the USIB damage report -.-
states: “Although there has been no observable indication
thet the Soviets have acted in any manner to the detriment. .
of the United States based. upon information considered pos= -.
sibly. compromised, it must be concluded that due to the ex-
tensive period of penetration, ‘the cumulative, effect has
resulted in serious damage to the United States. “Tbe
Soviets have gained considerable knowledge as to the effective-
neas of United States operations within the,Sovict. Union,
particularly the military attache collection progran.

Soviet knowledge of U.S. emphasis upon certain intelligence’
collection areas has made it possible for them to identify
priority intelligence and probable Soviet targets and thereby
permitted them to implement specific counteractions.. The
Soviets over the years must have amassed considerable infor~
mation concerning the personal habits, problens, attitudes
and weaknesses of personnel assigned to tne Embassy which
can be used by them for purposes of exploitation at any

time of their choosing in the future." oo

The following extract from the USIB damage report con-
cerns the declining value of the production from the micro-
phones in 1962 and 1963.*

"The security practices and procedures appear to
have followed a pattern from April 1953 to May 1960, at
a which time the first plastic room was installed. A
, change occurred in the work habits in that the nore
senior State Department officers utilized the plastic
room for sensitive discussions and dictation. The
room could accommodate only a limited portion of the
Embassy classified discussions and accordingly, a number
of classified discussions were held outside this secure
area. In the April 1953-May 1960 period it was an &c-
cepted practice for the Ambassador and the Deputy
Chief of Mission to discuss openty in their offices
routine classified operations of the Embassy and to
dictate classified documents and telegrams....In Sep-
tember 1962, the second acoustic room was erected for
the typing section for the handling of sensitive classi-
fied material. From December 1963 to date it was indi-
cated that no classified telegrams have been dictated

“ (444) Microphones in the Nocth Wing.

According to NOSENKO, no microphones or other audio devices’
were installed in the north wing (as distinct from the cnancery)
of the U.S. Embassy prior to its occupancy in 1962. (For this
reason, NOSENKO advised CiA in 1962 to transfer its sensitive
offices gradually--to protect NOSENKO's secsurity--fron the
chancery to the north wing at the Embassy.) He has commented
several times on this subject, and these remarks are presented
below.

li June 1962: “The Embassy is now located on Chaykovskiy
Street. When they decided to give the north wing to the Embassy,
I wrote an entire report about it. SWELEPIN was still there
then {as KGB Chairman. ~ proposed that} equipment be installed
in the walls, gave the justification for this, etc. SHELEPIN
wrote: ‘Is it worth it?' At the time trere was an improvement
in mutual relations (retween the Soviet Union and the United
States). SHELEPIN was a good lad, but feared that...and k2fore
this you found 18 or 20 microphones in the new building in War-
Saw.* SHELEPIN wrote: ‘is it worth it? We row have good re-
lations with America. It isn't worth it.' He didn't want com-
Plications., And.then time was lost. Two or three months passed
and we again wanted to try it. SHELEPIN also wanted to, but it
was already too late. ASIDIAN was going there all the time, the
Security Officer. It was already too late because this can be
done only while the kvilding is being built. When the windows
and doors have been begun it is already too late... The north
wing was almost ready. We don't have anything there. So, you
should move the Minister Counsellor there. Move him to the
north wing from his present office... Don't do it at once. Do
it slowly. Don't hurry; don't be in a hurry. Have him say that
he doesn't like this room and wants to move there... We hear
all the military attaches--the Milizary Attache, the Naval
Attache, and the Air Force Attache--in Moscow. Everything is
recorded. But again, don't do anything at once. Don't make
any (sudden) char.ges. Quietly transfer one and then another
there (to the north wing), the attache himself and his assist-
ants... You must be very, very clever ard very, very foxy...
Gradually, gradually move them to the north wing of the build-
ing, to the north wing, 1n which we have absolutely nothing and
won't have anything." co .

"31 January 1964: "When the construction of this right
(north) wing had begun, when you started the right wing, the
new addition to the building, there was a plan to install as:
many (microphones) as possible--thirty, forty--stick’ them.
everywhere. It really wasn't important how. many of them would
really work. The Committee (KGB) Chairman at that time was

_SHELEPIN. He didn't co for this. Whether it. was the flap:

' Was something else or whether it was the international situa-
‘ tion, they were afraid that this may be uncovered. But then,
later, when the building was finished, and when you were .
finishing or putting up the addition yourself,. at that point

” After being. told by..CIA on’31, January 1965 that a lead
cable had been found in the north wing, NOSENKO said: "I
personally can assure you that nothing was done in that
right wing. Nothing, absolutely nothing. Thore was ‘nothing

done there, so it must have been’ something else."

No extensive counter-audio checks have yet been cerried
out in the north wing of the U.S. Embassy, and no wired -
microphones have been found there. _ Investigation of the ..
microphones in-the main section of the Embassy led, however,
to the discovery of other Soviet technical equipment installed
in the north wing. The USIB damage report stated: "Three-
coaxial cables were discovered running parallel to the one- -
hundred-and-one pair audio cable from the North Annex roof
area to the basement of the North Annex...{All three cables
were severed by American technicians in 1964.] The ceble
runs were as follows:

"1. The, first coaxial cable...terminated under six
inches of reinforced concrete in the North Annex attic.
The certer conductor was connected to the lead sheath
of the 20-pair and of the 30 pair cable which in turn
come iroz the east face of the chancery. The shield of
the coaxial cable was uncunnected. .

"2, The second coaxial cable...followed the same path
as the first coaxial cable. The shield was unterminated.
The center conductor was terminated in an insulated
metal grill. The grill is lecated in the upper crust
of the North Annex attic floor with the long dimension
in juxtaposition to the old common wall between the
Chancery and the North Annex. The long diménsion is
normal to the street in front of the Embassy. The
grill is made of one centimeter steel reinforcing rods
spot welded into a mesh of 15 cm. (5.9 inches). The
overall dimensions of the grili are 14'4" by 4'°7".

The coaxial cable was conrected to one corner of the
erill....The grill is located as close as possible to
the old common wall and is about thirty feet below the
State Department code room. The grill ‘points’ in the
general direction of the code room as the plane of the
grill is parallel to the plane of the ground.

"3. The third coaxial cable ran along the approxinate
path of the other coaxial cables to the block cf rein-
forced concrete that contains the grill mentioaed above.
This coaxial cable terminated in a four-inch piece of
fine Lits wire. The shiéld of the coaxial cable was -
unterminated...".: °°. ,

The damagé- report added: . "The coaxial cables appear to be
of recent installation probably prior to Russian evacuation

“of the North Annex, The outer shields of all the coaxial

cables were carefully insulated."

as follows. in the damage report: "All tests that ‘have been.

© NOSENKO was questioned on 31 January 1964 about the
so-called “Moscow Signal." (This is an “S{ band Signal

that has been directed against the top floors—-the “secure
erea"--of the U.S. Embassy since the early 1950's from en
apartment building located about 200 feet away. _ Detailed
ipvestigation of the signal has been underway since Octo=
ber 1962, but its exact nature and purpose have not yet been
established. Although there is some speculation that the -
signal is meant for ‘harasszent purposes oaly, the view now
generally accepted by U.S. technicians is that it has som:
intelligence-collection function. No change in the signal
has beer noted since the discovery and the cutting of the
cables referred to in the preceding section.) The inter-

Yes, they keep working: all’ the time. Perhaps
periodically, but it's working. Yes, there is
something in the back.of the Embassy on this
Chaykovskiy Street, and there is something in
front of the Embassy, too. . :

And it is for listening in?

No, it's in order to deprive you of working with
stationary equipsent. ,

What do you mean--so that our receivers wouldn't
operate properly? ,

Look, I'm not a specialist. I don't know the
details. I know only that the work is being
done in this particular area, in this particular
direction. But what they do, I dontt really
know.

But this is-not for the purpose of obtaining in-

Questioned again later, NOSENKO said that the aignal

was lised to jam U.S, equipment working in the Embassy building.

It was this system, he said, which had determined. that the ; .

‘Americans had intercepted some GRU agent radio communications. , , .
‘The beam was designed “both to: monitor- and to jam" trars=

‘Y‘gissions from the Embassy... NOSENKO repeated that. "not being
&@ specialist" he was igcorant of the technical nature of the :
job, or any further details. ;

Because NOSENKO's true name and photographs had been submitted
to the U.S. fmbassy in Moscow in connection with this visa request,
NOSENKO added, it was henceforth necessary for him to use his
true name for all travel abroad.

c. The Cuba TDY (1960)

In November 1960, after and as a result of the cancellation
of his planned trip to the United States, NOSENKO travelled with
a delegation of nickel industry experts to Cuba. He first men-
tioned this trip on 11] Jure 1562, during his second meeting with

“CIA. His account of his activities was given in answer to the

question of whether he had ever visited Germany: "I have been

in Germany. Yes, yes. I wag in Cuba in '6]. Well, as NIKOLAYEV.

I was there a month and a half. This was when your Embassy was 3
there and we wanted to prepare*... Well, I looked it cver to

see what kind of people you had working there. They asked me

to prepare, so to. speak, én accounting on how things were going.

I arrived there and asxed how they were working against you, just

on you. Everyone there is working for you. One, two, three,

five days went by... I had unlimited funds, any arcunt. I could
go to any resvaurant, any show. So that's how it was with me.
The fellows reported: ‘He {an iunerican} is there.' My mission
was to get a general picture. Not for one, two, or three days,
put for a month or two, to provide an opinicn... I worked pretty
cleverly on trem, He [the American] would go to a restaurant.
They would say to me: ‘He is at such-and-such a restaurant and
can be observed there.' I would go and observe him in the mir-

ror or somehow. I am sitting in the restaurant, drinking, and
that's all. But I would watch him to see how he behaves, etc.,
etc. That is, I would begin to feel if he has the mark of an
intelligence officer. ...But this was not enough for me. I
would go again and again. i would see that, yes, he is an in-
telligence officer... We were asked to share our experiences
with them [the Cubans]. They didn't know a thing... They had
turned ali intelligence work over to the Communist Party. The
Communist Party complicates it."

In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in
1962 the sudject of his trip to Cuba came up again; NOSENKO re-
called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba
and that his function there was that of security officer

Question: When did you travel to Cuba?
NOSENKO: 1960, November and December 1960.
Question: Under the name NIKOLAYEV?

NOSENKO: No, as NOSENKO, NOSENKO, NOSENKO. I will explain

: how this happened. I was supposed to go to America,
: sometime in November, with a group from Gosplan,

. automotive specialists, etc. Data had already b
submitted for coordination and, in particular, my

provided any interesting reports on her American contacts... At_
the end of 1960 or in the beginning of 1961, NOSENKO said, she
was released from the Emkassy by Paul SMITH, possibly because
she was a little deaf and one had to epeak loudly to her to te

fore he returned to the Tourist Departmen nt, and later the British
Department was planning to use her in either the British or Canad~
ian Embassies.

. Overseas Assignments . a
a. Attempt to Obtain Assignment. in Ethicpia (1960) .

During the first half of 1960, NOSENKO said, he applied for
a permanent overseas assignment to Ethiopia because doctors had
prescribed a change of climate for his daughter Oxsana's asthma. -
O.M. GRIBANGV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, approved
his reguest, but then the KGS Personnel Department turned it
down when a file review revealed potentially dangerous character
weaknesses. 7

NOSENKO described this matter on 14 April 1964 as follows:
"Gennadiy GRYAZNOV came to the American Cepartment of the Second
Chief Dircctorate in 1958. Before 1956 he was stucying in the
Higher Schocl of the KGB and when he finished the school in 1956
he was assigned to the KGB Personnel Department, and then he came .
to the American Department in 1958. So GRYAZNOV had very good
connections in the Personnel Department. So in 1960, when I
wanted to leave, to yo abroad on permanent assignment I said to
GRIBANOV: ‘Let me go for two years to Ethiopia.' When the Per-
sonnel Department refused to let me go, I decided I'd just have
to know what was there in my personal file. I had to learn what
it was that was causing all this. By that time GRYAZNOV was in
the American Department of the Second Chief Directorate and hap-
pened to be the head of the Party Organization of the entire
directorate, and he at one time had worked in the Personnel Office -«
himself. He sid: ‘Give me this thing and I'll see wnat I can
find out about it.' So he went to the Personnel Department and
through his friend there got my personal file. Then he gave me
a call ‘and said to come over. I went to his office and he locked
the door. Of course, he couldn't give me this file, couldn't
let me hold it in my hands so to speak. So he read this case
to me, this 1954 case to me, about the woman and so forth,* and
then said that at that time they made an investigation of my
previous residence. And they found out that while I was study-
ing at the Institute [cf International Affairs] and was living
on Pervaya Meschanskaya Street, all sorts of girls visited me;
different girls, a new girl would visit me almost every week.
This was in my file. Then this case that took place in 1954.

And then in 1960--and, incidentally, GRIBANOV mentioned this to

me also--the file said that I was drinking quite a bit, and for
this reason I had many fights with my wife. And that was all

that appeared in my file. Nothing else, whatsoever, besides

these things that I just mentioned."

b. U.S. Visa Application (1960)

NOSENKO's true name appeared with 11 others on a 20 October
_ 1960 request to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for visas for members
. Of a Soviet automotive exchange delegation which was scheduled _

to visit ‘the United States in mid-November 1960.* NOSENXO.was
listed as an engineer. employed by the State Sciertific-Tecanical -
Committce (GNTK). After defecting, NOSENKO told CIA that he had
been scheduled te accompany this delegation as a security cffi-
cer but that the delegation's visit to the United States had
been postponed at the last moment. He therefore did not travel
to this country.

He further explained, on 17 April 1964, why his visa appli-
cation had been submitted in true name an¢ under a different
cover: “In 1957 and 1958 I want to Londen as NIKGLAVEV repre-
senting the Ministry of Culture. Then in 1959 I didn't ge any-
where. ‘hen when this question came up Of my going to the States
in 1960, I said: 'I'm rot going. I've keen going under the
Ministry of Culture {cover} and with sperts delegations. This
has to be changed somehow at this poi " So we theught about
it and finally somebody said: . 'Locs, how about this? Perhaps
{you can use] this committee cE RULNEV's ([GNTK].' Se 1 said:
“."Well, it's up to you. You decide.' by that time my passport
was ready, but the Americans and the Soviets nadn't come to an
agreencnt yet. It was decided that this celegation would go ts
the U.S. in 1961." NOSENKO was then asked why he coulc not
have used the NIKOLAYZY name for his trip to the United States.
He replied: “Sure, I could have gene as NIEOLAYEV, but I just
didn't want to. Pecause, look, it was known to us that the
British and American Incelligance exchange information on people
they suspect of being KGB, and that the British, of course,
had probably watched me when I was in England {in 1957 and 1958]
and probably there it was noticed that here's this man under
the cover cf Ministry of Culture. He's not a sportsman. rt
xind of looks suspicious. Then he goes to the Soviet Embassy.
Also suspicious. So then I nave to go to the States. And if
I go as NIKCLAYEV I couldn't use--in that case I cculdn’t use
the same cover of Ministry of Culture Lecause of the type of
the delegation. I'd have to use a different cover. ‘So I'd go
there and they'd say: ‘Aha, here's NIKOLAYEV under different
cover now.' But if I go as NOSENKO, the British never heard
the nang. Nobody knows the name. Everything would be O.K."
NOSENKO was then asked why he could not have travelled under
some other alias. He answered: “That's the way it wes ce-
cided. I guess so as not to get all mixed up they decided to
| pend me as NOSENKO anyway. It's up to the people who are in

charge of these operations. They are the ones who decide."**

*— This visa application was submitted approximately six months
after the KGB rejected his request for PCS assignment to
Ethiopia.

With regard to his trips to England in 1957 and 1958, NOSENKO
said that he had’ been forced to use the name NIKCLAYEV because

Because NOSENKO's true name'and photographs had been submitted
to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in connection with this visa request,
NOSENKO added, it was henceforth necessary for him to use his
true name fer all travel abroad. i : i

ce. The Cuba TDY (1960)

In November 1960, after and as a recult of the cancellation
of his planned trip to the United States, NOSENKO travelled with
a delegation of nickel industry experts to Cuba. He first men-
tioned this trip on 11 June 1962, during his second meeting with
CIA. His account of nis activities was given in answer to the
question of whether he had ever visited Germany: "I have been
in Germany. Yes, yes. JI wags in Cuba in '63, Well, as NIKOLAYEV.
I was there a montn and a half. This was when your Embassy was
there and we wanted to prepare*... Well, I lcoked it cver to
see what kind of people you hed working there. They asked me
to prepare, so to speak, en accounting on how things were going.
I arrived there and asked how they were working against you, just
on you. Everyone there is worxing for you. One, two, three,
five days went by... I had uniimited funds, any awount. I could
go to any resvaurant, any show, So that's how it was with me.
The fellows r ‘He {an fumerican}] is there.' hy mission
was to get a general picture. Not for one, two, cor three days,
put for a inonth or two, to provide an opinicn... I worked pretty
cleverly on trem. He [the American} would go to a restaurant,
They would say to ne: 'He is at such-and-such a restaurant and
can be observed there.' I would go and observe him in the mir-
ror or somehow. I am sitting in the restaurant, drinking, and
that's all. But I would watch him to see how he behaves, etc.,
etc. That is, I would begin to feel if he has the mark of an
intelligence officer. ...But this was not enough for me. I
would go again and again. I would see that, yes, he is an in-
telligence officer... We were asked to share our experiences
with them [the Cubans]. Tiley didn't know a thing... They had
turned all intelligence work over to the Communist Party. The
Communist Party complicates it.”

In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in
1962 the sudject of his trip to Cuba came up again; NOSENKO re-
called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba
and that his function there was that of security officer.

Question: When did you travel to Cuba?
NOSENKO: 1960, November and December 1960.
Question: Under the name NIKOLAYEV?

NOSENKO: No, as NOSENKO, NOSENKO, NOSENKO. I will explain , t
how this happened. I was supposed to go to America, -t
sometime in November, with a group from Gosplan, 4
automotive specialists, etc. Data had already been tod

said that a worker [XG3 officer} should be sent.

But they decided not to send @ worker to Cuba. ;
“Why bother?” [they said]. “Is Cuba worth it?* ;
Suddenly there was a phone call from the Central . :
Committee fof the Communist Party]. Scmeone fron oo
the Central Committee said: “No, there is a direc- ;
tive that one of our workers must ge nevertheless."

And only two days remained before the departure of

the delegation. Wno could they send?

Question: The first person they come across.

NOSENKO:; Trose who have passports. I had a passport. I was -

~~ veady. And they decided: "Get going immediately.”
We flew through imsterdam, through Geneva. We spent
a night in Amsterdam and then made a short step in
Geneva, then the Azores, Santa Maria Island, then we
were supposed to fly to Curacao, But we had a head-
wind and the pilots were evidently afraid that ve
wouldn't have enough fuel. So the plane went out
of ite way and made a landing on the island of Bar-
bados. This was not a Soviet plane, hut KLM. We
flew to Amsterdam on a TU-104 and then went by KLM.
Then from Curacao we flew to Arube. We also spent
a night in Aruba, an interesting island; the water
and natural surroundings are beautiful. From Aruba
we flew througa Kingston, through Jamaica, and then
to Cuba. And we flew the seme route back, but we
did not spend the night in Curacao. From Curacao we
landed in Caracas for about 40 minutes, and’ through
Parararinc--Sitch Guiana--acrcss tne ocean, some
island or anotner there, and from there again Lis-
bon, Geneva, and Amsterdam. But here the entire
Gelegation flew [to Moscow] after a day or two and
I took a train through West Germany [to East Berlin].

All of NOSENKO's accounts since contacting CIA in 1964 have
been generally consistent with that given on 14 June 1962. His
story has been as follows: In the latter part of 1960, at the
game time as he was preparing for his intended trip to the
United States, a special cGelegation of nickel industry experts
from Gosplan, the Soviet State Planning Commission, was prepar- !
ing for Asparture to Cuba. The delegaticn was a routine one, 2
consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of the :

4 Soviet Union, and since there was no one under any sort of sus-

picion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abroad) Department of

the Second Chief Directorate nad decided that it would not be
necessary to include a security officer. Two days prior to the Lo |

departure of the group, however, the Central Committee cf the ; 4

Communist Party decided that a Second Chief Directorate case :

officer must go along. Because of the short time remaining be-

fore the scheduled departure of the delegation, the Eleventh

Department protested that it would be impossible to find a suit-

: able person and get all the necessary papers ready in time. At

i ; this point, A.I. KUZNETSOV of the Eleventh Department said:

. '®Just a minute. We have a man who has his passport all ready.
Bis passport has been formalized. NOSENKO. He was supposed to
go to the States... and his foreign passport has been issued

co and signed. Why don't you take him?" NOSENKO's statement con-

says ‘Never mind, The Cuban3 will give him an entry visa.’

And then I had to get a transit visa because we were flying
through Arscterdam, And this whole thing was taken care of in
two days. The Cubans gave their visa immediately and The
Netherlands igsued their visa also right away."

NOSENKO has reported that his functions with this deleca-
tion were purely of a security nature. He flew with the dele-
gation to Cuba in October or November and spent abouc a month
&nd@ a half there. During this time he accompanied the delega-
tion everywhere it went “I was with the delegation. They go
to a plant--I go with chem to the plant. I was with them all
the time. They went co ‘ifferent plants, to watch the produc-
tion. They met with some representa'ives of the so-called Insti-
tute of Agrarian Reform. They would meet with these people and
they would have many Giscussions about how to increase produc-
tion." HOSENKO's cover assignnent was deputy chief of the deie-
gation an shortly before Ceparting Mosccw he was introduced to
the other members as sucn. He had one agent within the delega~
tion and developed several “confidential contacts" wiring the
trip, which turned cut to be entirely uneventful and, for NOSENKO,
somewhat long and dull. He explained that .e@ would not have
accepted the assignment nad he known how leng the trip was to be,
and that he nad really wanted to go ony t- the United States.

un his return trip to Moscow, NOSENKO was given a special
mission. As he was leaving from Havana Airport,’ the KGB Legal
Resident in Cuba, 4.1. ALEXSEYEV, nanded him a package with in~
structions to deliver it to Moscow. NOSENKO did npt know the
contents of the package until he arrived in Amsterdam en route
home, There the wrappings became ioose (it was bound only by
thin string) and NOSENKO toox the opportunity to determine that
it contained copies of “letters betwee. MIKOYAN and KHRUSHCHEV
concerning the prices of sugar" and drafts of agreements between
the Soviet Union and East Germany, Bulyaria, Czechoslovakia,
and Rumania. Arriving with his delegation at the airpert in
Amsterdam, NISENKO was toid that a message had been received
from the Central Committee of the Communist Party instructing
that the package was to be delivered "urgently" to Che GUEVARA,
who was tour_ng the Sateilite countries and was then in Berlin.
While the delegation continued on to Moscow, NOSENKO therefore
was driven to the Soviet Embassy in The Hague, and in the late
evening of his second day in The Netherlands he left by train
for East Berlin. When he arrived, however, he found that
GUEVARA had left Berlin for Hungary. NOSENKO refused to go any
further. The package was delivered to GUEVARA's deputy in
Berlin, and NOSENKO then returned to Moscow.

CIA travel records show that NOSENKO, listed as a mineral
engineer, transitted Amsterdam en route to Cuba on 15 November
1960; and that he transitted Caracas from amsterdam on 17 Novem-
ber 1960; and that on 19 November 1960 he went through Caracas
en route to Havana.* Our records also show that NOSENKO again
arrived in Amsterdam en route to Moscow from Havana on 13 Decem-
ber 1960 and that he left for Moscow on 15 December. There is
no record that he travelled to Berlin. **

a. ‘The Bulgaria TDY and the LUNT Case
In the spring of 1961, four months after returning from
Cuba, NOSENKO was sent on temporary assignment for about a
month to Sofia, the only trip he took in other than a security Loe
®watchdog" capacity. According to NOSENKO, it happened this oan
ways “I think I first heard that I was going to Bulgaria, a f
week or so before I left, from S.I. YEGORCV, Chief of the : ; i
section having. contact with the counterintelligence representa~ : o ;
tives of the Countries of the Pecples' Democracies in Moscow... .
He said: ‘You must go to Bulgaria. GRIBANOV nas decided.’
He asked, ‘Do you know about this?’ and 1 said 'lo." He said:
*KLYPIN [Chief of the American Department} must tell you.’ But
this was the first I had heard about it. YEGOROV said that the
Minister of the Bulgarian MVR had reguested the Chairman of the
aed KGB to send an officer from the American Department of the Sec-
ond Chief Directorate to Bulgaria for consultation with the
---— 7-2 -vrAmerican Departhent, Second Directorate-of the MVR of Bulgaria...
“After one or two days KLYPIN told me about it. He répeated —~
the same thing and after about one and a hali weeks 1 flew to
Sofia." The discussicn continued as follows:

Question: What plans were made for this trip in Moscow before
rou left? What briefings or discussions were held
concerning what you were to do in Scfia?

NOSENKO: I was told: “You are goirg for consultations. There
are KGB advisors there. They will discuss it with
you." No one was speaking with me about my trip.

Question: What discussions did you have with your department
chief, KLYPIN, about what you were to do on this
trip?

. NOSENKO: Nothing. He told me: “You will go. You will see , j
: . what they are doing. You will tell them how to 5
, work." :

Question: Did you have any meetings or discussions with the }
representatives of the Bulgarian MVR in Moscow be- ; i

fore you left?
NOSENKO: No.

Question: What discussions did you have with YEGOROV or his
oe section about what you were going to do in Sofia?

NOSENKO: YEGOROV said: “You will go. You will tell us what
they are doing.” :

estions. Did you know the names of any of the officers of the
American Department of the. Bulgarian MVR?: :

NOSENKO: No. Nothing.

Question: Did ‘you know just what was the area of responsibility
° of the American Department of the Bulgarian MVR? .

NOSENKO: No. Nothing.

NOSENKO flew from Moscow in early April 1961 and was met
at the airport in Sofia by A.S. KO2LOV, a former Second Chief . :
Directorate officer whom he had known in Moscow.* The follow . : 4
ing morning he was picked up in an official vehicle and wes . poe i
taken to KOZLOV's office in the Bulgarian MVR building, not far 3
away. NOSENKO asked KOZLOV what was expected of him and was 4
told that "they want to know about how to work against the Ameri- 4
can Legation. He said he wanted me to tell them everything about
how to work, right from letter 'A.'" NOSENKO was.then intro-
duced to the Chief KGB adviser in Sofia, Mikhail YEGOROV, and
to the Chief of the MVR's American Department, after which he
was assigned an office in the MVR building. During the ensuing
weeks he discussed both general matters and particuler cases
with individual Bulgarian officers working agsinst the American
target. On one occasion he lectured interested MVR officers
on the principles of operations against fereign military person-
nel in Moscow, and on another he visited an MVR surveillance
post opposite tne American Legation. He discussed.KGB methods
of operations against foreign tourists. He also addressed the
entire American Department for about five hours and told them a4
“what is necessary, what to pay attention to, how to work.” 4
At the end of his. visit, some time in mid-May, NOSENKO conferred
with the First Deputy Minister of the MVR about what had been
accomplished and his recommendations for improving operations
against Americans. © .

As an outgrowth of his TDY to Bulgaria, NOSENKO has pro-
vided one lead to a case in which he said he took personal part. . an
About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around the end of
April 1961, NOSENKO was going over lists of foreigners who were
schedvled to visit Bulgaria* in the near future, and he came ce t
across the name Horace G. LUNT. NOSENKO recalled that a man :
named LUNT who was a Slavic linguist had been reported to him
in 1958 or 1959 by one of his homosexual agents, VOLKOV or ,
YEFREMOV, as a possible homosexual. He asked the Bulgarians :
whether this man was a specialist in Slavic languages. When :
the Bulgarian officers replied in the affirmative, NOSENKO de-
cided to check his recollection against KGB records and an
immediate phone call was placed to Moscow,: asking for traces.

*¥-NOSENKO had earlier reported that KOZLOV had served as the
Chief of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate,
until 1953 and that, until about two years before going to i
Bulgaria as a counterintelligence advisor, he had been 1.

why KOZLOV was unable to “advise” the Bulgarians in this.

homosexual proclivities and that the. Bulgarian MVR had not pre-
viously known of then. . ~

NOSENKO's description of what happened next is as follows:
®“OZLOY and the Chief of the American Department were very in-

terested. KOZIOV said: ‘George {NOSENK9]. you must help them.

They never recruited an American.’ I said that I would do what }

I could. The three of us went to see General DUMKGV, the :

Chief of the Second Directorate, Bulgarian MVR. IT asked them . i
i

if they had a homosexual agent. They checked and said they

had one who is an operational conzact. O , I said, acquaint
them, prepare a flat, make the pictures. ‘This is the first
stage. I also told them, of course, to find out how long he

had been tere, why, who his acquaintances were, etc. Then we
wert to YEGCROV, the senior Soviet advisor, and KOZLOV. called
GRIBANOV. GRIEANOV, I later found out, was in a meeting with
the department chiefs of the Second Chief Directorate and was
not in a good mood, Why, I don't know. He didn't understand
what KOZLOV was saying. GRIBANCV thought chat I, myself, wanted
to make the approach to LUNT. KOZLOV got confused on the p.cne.
GRIBANOV asked to speak to me. I took the phone, ‘What are
you doing?’ he said. ‘You are not at heme, you are abroad.

You were sent only for consultations, but you are living as if
you were at home.’ I said: ‘'O.K., 0.K. I wasn't going to do
anything.’ He hung up. I told KOZLOV that even if the Bulgar-
jans were to ask me, I could not do it myself. YEGCROV became
upset. He thought our position was bad because the Bulgarians . . :
were asking. ‘What they ask, I will tell,’ I said, ‘but I am 7 4
not leaving the office to go any place or do anything. I can - i
only advise them on how to make the record entries after he is : :
caught. I can dictate the questions to be asked. But the
approach and recruitment I cannot do myself.'

“The Bulgarians never said anything to me about active
participation, but they didn't know what to do. I told them
to get two agents. Maybe LUNT wouldn't like the first one.
The Bulgarians reported that LUNT wouldn't be there ‘ong. I a
told them that if they wanted to take pictures and make a pitch q
later, that's one thing. But if they wanted to do it all in -
one step, that is another. I told them they should consider the
time element... The Chief cf the American Department, KOVACHEV,.
and the chief of the section dealing with tourists and American
delegations were to make the recruitment. The approach was
made at the end of April, I think.” cee :

NOSENKO went on to say: "I was in the office during the

- approach. I told them I would not leave. ‘If you need my oe ae

‘advice,’ I said, ‘come to me.’ KOZLOV and I were sitting in i
his office. It was the end of April, I think, and the next

‘day I went on holiday. I don't know where or how they approached. . 7

The outcome was not. known to KOSENKO’.‘forhe said: "I.

I went on a little trip, the May holidays, part of 30 April, 1,

that he {[.UNT}“had left. I asked them what they had decided for
the future, a contact in the United States or not. They said
they decided against it because he was to come to Bulgaria in
1962 or 1963 for a Slavic conference.”

This account, which NOSENKO gave on 6 October 1964, differs
somewha: from what he had said earlier, -.on 11,June 1962, during
his second meeting with CIA. NOSENKO claimed tnen that he per-
sonally participated in the recruitment of LENT against GRIBANOV's
wishes: "They sent me in '61 to Bulgaria. ‘The Minister of Internal
Affairs there asked for a specialist to help them. I went to
help. An {American) professor arrived, a very prominent special-
ist on the Slavic countries... They [the Bulgarians} had never
tried {to recriit} an American. ‘Let's try,' I said. The Sov-
jet advisor in Bulgaria telephoned GRIBANOV and reported that
NOSENKO had decided that it is possible to get this American.
GRIBAKGY was in a conference at the time. GRIBANOV said: "Where
the hell's NOSENKO? Let me talk to him... What the hell are
you doing? I sent you only as an advisor.' Then he hung up.
What ccuid I do? The Buigarians had already mace all prepara-~
tions... i was embarrassed, but what could I do? I left the
office of the advisor and they *ere waiting for me... I de-
cided to go ahead. I was sure that it would work, I felt that
it could be done, that this American could be firmly recruited...
I spit on everything and went ahead with the Bulgarians. I
told trem to grab him. If it will be difficult for you, tell
me and I myself can recruit him, Weil, they began and I came
there. He [NCSENKO is speaking of himself] was under the guise
of a Bulgarian and spoke in English, although my English was
poor... I said: ‘You are a pederast.' He also proved him=
self to be a homosexual there [in Bulgaria]... ‘Well, what will
society think of you, those whose know you?" Well, what did
this person decide? He agreed.“

The first time NOSENKO said that he had not participated
directly in this operation was on 2 February 1964, while still
in Geneva. He volunteered the following: "In Bulgaria in

‘ April and May 1961, although I did not personally participate

in this, I went there, and. I helped them there with the whole
process of recruitment of this professor. I helped the Bul-
garians with what to do and how. He was the professor of
philolery, LUT." .

" NOSENKO has also varied on the timing of the operation

‘against LUNT. In the account quoted above, he said that the

approach was made the day before he left on his. May Day holi-
day. On 24 April 1964 he said: "I remember that it was at
the very beginning of May that this name came up. And we got
the informaticn from Moscow the same day, telling us it was
the same LUNT. _I went on a trip the lst, 2nd, 3rd of May.

‘That is the 30th of April, lst and 2nd of May, and the 3rd of |

May in the morning I was back. So it was in the very beginning:
after the night of the trip. And Moscow was called right away,

this was established,.- the next day the Bulgarians: plarted this.

a : or in the restaurant and, well, he met LUNT and they got tc-
gether and decided to meet with each other the same day or the
next day. This was all.done very rapidly."

According to Professor LUNT, the approach actually took
place on 5 May 1961, following a visit to Moscow where he had
contacted an official in the U.S. Embassy. Ee travelled on
9 May directly from Sofia to Yugoslavia, where he at once re- «| ;
ported the incident to U.S. Ambassador George ¥% INAN,;.an aca- : . |
demic acquaintance. LUNT told the Ambassador, and later CIA, ,
that he had visited Sofia on one earlier occasion, from 8 to
26 November 1960. During this first trip he became involved
with one Georgi Velev ALEKSIEV, with whom he engaged in homo-
sexual relations on at least five separate occasions and to
whem he gave U.S. travellers checks, which ALEKSIEV intended ;
to sell on the black market. On one occasion during the first
visit ALEKSIEV was recognized and stopped by the Bulgarian ~~

civil police while walking cn the street with LUNT. After
' ° leaving Bulgaria in November 1960, LUNT received two letters
from ALEKSIEV and prior to his next visit, cn 25 April 1561,
LUNT wrote ALEKSIEV saying he would be returning. “

he mturned to the Tourist Department in 1962.

. Transfer to the Tourist: Department in January 1962 °..

In the autumn of 1961 a decision was reached, on the basis

- Of NOSENKO's own request, to return him to the Tourist Depart-

ment. GRIBANOV had originally wanted to promote NOSENKO fron.

the position of Deputy Chief of the U.S, Embassy Section to the

pest of Deputy Chief of the American Department; NOSENKO's

. superior and friend KOVSHUK had leng had hts eye on this job,

however, and was the personal choice of the Chief of the Ameri-
can Department for it. (In fact; NOSENKO said, KOVSHUK had

once held the job, lcsing it in 1959 because of some misbehavior.)
NOSENKO did not want to be placed in the difficult situation
which his own promoticn to this post would have created. NOSENKO

. @escribed his transfer in the February 1965 interrogations. The

following is from a protocol signed on 26 February 1965:

“The decision for.me to return to the Seventh [Tourist]
Desartrent.in January 1962 was actually made in about Septen-
ber or Cctober 1961. GRIBANOV planned to appoint me Deputy
Chief of the First [American] Department, but the new Chief
of the First Department, FECLOSEYEY,wanted KOVSKUK to take
this position. Since I did not want to be placed in this
position by GRIBANOV's order against the wishes of FLDOSEYEY,
I went to GRIBANOV and requested that I be transferred back
to the Seventh Department, in any position. I had already
spoken to [V.D.] CHELNOKOY, who was then Chief of the
Seventh Department, about this matter and he had suggested
that I go to GRIBANOV and ask to be returned to the Seventh
Department 4s Chief of the First [American-British-Canadian]
Section with the understanding that I would be appointed -
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department as soon as this
position would be vacated by [B.A.] BALDIN [who was retiring
in July 1962]. ...GRIBANOV did not teli me his reasons...
for wanting to appoint me Deputy Chief of the First Depart-
ment in late 1961 or for appointing me Section Chief and
later Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department in 1962. He
did not discuss with me my personal qualifications for.
each of these positions.”

Aware of his impending transfer NOSENKO took the opportunity
during December 1961 to spend several hours each day in the Tour-
ist Department. There he talked with Department Chief CHELNOKOV,
familiarized himself with certain files of the American Tourist
Section, ‘and discussed current operations and operational possi-
bilities with the officers assigned to this section. The formal
order for the transfer was signed by GRIBANOV on 24 or 25 Decem-

ber 1961 and NOSENKO officially signed over the ABIDIAN case file |

and the U.S. Embassy security file to his successor as beputy
Chief of the American Embassy Section, G.I. GRYAZNOV, within the

-next few'days.* As he had when he transferred from the Tourist

to the American Department in 1960, NOSENKO said, he took his —
active agents and his safehouse on Vorovskiy Street with him when.

"These specific dates were arrived at under. interrogation in
February 1965. On all earlier occasions NOSENKO had said _
that he was transferred in January 1962 (or some later date); .
“he said in. February 1965 that he was "officially® transferred —
at the end of December and reported to his new position at
(the beginning of January (see below). f :

NOSENKO has given different dates for the time when he left
the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Departmert to become
Chief of the American-British-Canadian Section of the Tourist
Department. During the Geneva meetings of 1962 he said on
-different occasions that this occurred in January 1962 and in
February 1962; in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling between
15 and 20 January 1962; and in February 1965 NOSENKO gave the
date as 2 or 3 canuary 1962, He has also reported that he was
in the U.S. Embassy Section for three months after John ABIDIAN
serviced the Pushkin Street dead drop (on 30 December 1961, thus
placing NOSENKO in the U.S. Embassy Section until late March
1962) and that he had transferred to the Tourist Department by
the time do.tirsyn defected (which NOSENKO placed in mid-January
1962 but Which actually occurred in mid-December 196%3).* W.E.
JOHNSON, the target of a Tourist Department operaticn** con- .

- £€irmed that NOSENKO approached him in Moscow on 5 January 1962.

In February 1965 NOSENKO said he recalled that the correct
date of his approach to JOHNSON was on 5 January 1962. The CIA
interviewer then remirded NOSENKO that he had earlier described
on several occasions his visit to the dead drop site on Pushkin
Street and his receipt of reports from the surveillance post
for three months afterwards; during all of this period, NOSENKO
had said, he was in the U.S. Embassy Section of the First Depart-
ment. NOSENKO was told that CiA records show that ABIDTAN made
only one visit to this dead drop site, .on 30 December 1961, six
days before the approach to JOHNSON. He answered only that he
might have been confused, but despite any contradictions the
"facts" (his emphasis) were the important thing, not any corre~
lation of dates.

2. Functions and Activities

As Chief of the american-British-Canadian Section of the
Tourist Department (hereafter in Part V.F. referred to as the
American Tourist Section) from January to July 1962, NOSENKO
said, he was responsible for planning and coordinating all
KGB activities against such tourists in the USSR as well as
for supervising the operational work of 15 subordinate case
officers. He had no deputy. NOSENKO told CIA that he required

_ several months at the beginning of 1962 “to get the feel of
things"; "there were no accomplishments" on his part in the
initial period on this new job, and plans for handling the
influx of American tourists during the forthcoming 1962 season
consisted of studying files and continuing to work against the .
tourists as in the past. NOSENKO was asked in February 1965 .

whether, in his first several, months in the Tourist Department,
he had originated any new methods for operations ageinst Am-
erican tourists. He replied that during this period he nad
proposed a study of representatives of foreian rourist firms
in Moscow with an eye toward the KGH attempting to recruit
them.* This suggestion, NOSENKD said, had been accepted.

In March 1965, NOSENKO was asked whar new knowledge con-
cerning the use of tourism for espionag2 purposes by foreign
incelligence organizations had been acquired by the KGB curing
nis two-year absence from the Tourist Department. He replied
that. the KGB had noted an increase in automobile tourism and : ‘
that American Intelligence had increased 1ts use of multinational ,
tourist groups, NOSENKO was then asked what new information
concerning the use of tourism as a cover for espionage activity
had been obtained by the KGB from any ag source auring tt
period, NOSENKO answered that he neitner kcew of any such new
information nor had he heard of such an acgent.**

NOSENKO has said that, in line with the wishes of the Chief
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, O.M. GRIRANOY, Ae was pro-
moted to the position of Deputy Chief of the entire Tourist
Department in July 1962, immediately efter his return from
Geneva. A year later he was made Firs: Deputy Chief of the
Departinent, a promotion which involved only a change in title
as there was no Second Deputy Chief at the time. Apert from
saying he was V.D, CHELNOKOY's second-in-command from July 1962
to January 1964 and as such general supervisor of all KGB tour-
ist operations, NOSENKO has not detailed the functions attached
to this position; NOSENKO has not been questioned specifically
concerning these duties.

NOSENKO's first operaticnal activity after transferring to
the American Tourisc Section was supervision of a homosexual
approach to W.E, JCHNSUN on 5 Jenuary 1962. Additionally, during
the 1962-64 period in the Tourist Deparu t NOSENKO tcok part
in the recruitment approach to Horst BRAUNS, in the interrogation
of Yale University Professor Frederick BARCHOORN, and in the
arrest of the American tour guide Bernard KOTEN. For a short
time in 1963 he handled the KGB agent Alexarder SVENCHANSKIY,
owner of a tourist agency in New York City*** and a Russian
language bookstore in Chicago, Illinois, By virtue of his

in 1958-59, forming the basis of the FRIPPEL operation (see
Part V.D.5.).

BLAKE, a staff officer of MI-6, who confessed after his
arrest in April i961 that he had passed to his Soviet
handlers the complete minutes of joint meetings held by

JOHNSON, BRAUNS, BARGHOORN, KOTEN, SVENCHANSKLY, and SHUBIN - are

discussed below.) NOSENKO reported that his planned role in the.

approach to Natalie BIENSTOCK (see Part VI.D.2.) was prevented ©
by his preparations to leave for Geneva in March 1962, Finally,
NOSENKO said he participated in the KGB invesrigation of Lee
Harvey OSWALD after P-esident KHINEDY's assassination in Novem-
ber 1963 (see Part V.D.6.). ;

NOSENKO has indicated that his own operational work in 1962
to 1964 was limited to those cases cited above because of the
considerable amount of time spent on temporary duty assignments
outside Moscow during these two years. In mid-February 1962,
soon after assuming the duties of Chief of the American Tourist
Section, he began to prepare for his first trip to Geneva, which
lasted from 14 March until 15 June 1962 (see Part III.B.). NOS.
ENKO estimated that he had spent a total of six months outside
Moscow in 1963 on temporary assignments. These included a two-
day trip to Odessa to meet FRIPPEL, an inspection tour of the
Leningrad KGB organization, a five-day trip to Leningrad for a
conference on border control, a week-long trip to Alma-Ata for
a conference on tourist travel with KGB representatives from
the Soviet Central Asian republics, and an eight- or ten-day
inspection trip to the Caucasus as a member of a tean headed by
GRIBANOV. NOSENKO said he travelled to Gétrkiy Oblast on 16-17
December 1963 to assist in the search for CHEREPANOV, who had
passed top secret documents to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (see
Part VI.D.7.c.).

3. NOSENKO's Agents

When NOSENKO returned to the Tourist Department in the
first days of 1962, he took with him the agents whom he had
been handling as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section.
These agents are listed below with a summary of NOSENKO's com-
ments concerning their use in 1962 and 1963.*

a. Arsene FRIPPEL:

FRIPPEL had been reassigned from Moscow in early 1961, but
NOSENKO continued to be the Second Chief Directorate case offi-
cer in charge of any future KGB contacts with him. (FRIPPEL
had no KGB contacts in New York City.) Describing FRIPPEL's
past service for the KGB on 15 June 1962, five months after he
said he transferred to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO said:
“FRIPPEL was afraid and gave practically nothing... He was
a weak agent... I recruited him but, speaking honestly, he

“was not an agent." Nevertheless, NOSENKO. said, the KGB hoped

that FRIPPEL would be reassigned to the USSR at some future
date. When FRIPPEL returned twice to the Soviet Union in
1963, NOSENKO met with him, once in Odessa and once -in Moscow,

*:. The only other agent. whom NOSENKO handled during this ,
period was the American Alexander SVENCHANSKIY. (See
Part V.F.6.). . .

, put FRIPPEL provided nothing useful on theze occasions,*
whereas NCSENKO had normally met FRIFPEL in the company of
CHELNOKOV during FRIPPEL's Moscow tour, he went alone to the
two 1963 meetings.

b, Johan PREISFREUND:

After GOLITSYN's cefection, NOSEUKO said, the KGS considered

PREISFREUND compromised to American Intelligence and therefore

ineligible for further use against Anericans at the Embassy in

Moscow. For this reason NOSENKO was told by the U.S, Embassy

Section to continue to tandle PREISEREUND while serving in the

.. "Tourist Depertment, but as PREISEFREUND spcke only Finnish and

: | Russian, he was of no use against English-spesking tourists.

: . - Although NOSERKO met with PREISFREUND on the letter's visits to
“Moscow in 1952 and 1953, this agent wes not used operationally.

. c. VOLKOV_and YEFPS :

NOSENKO's two homosexual agents VOLKOV and YEFREMOV took
part in the entrapment aporoach to W.E. SOF N several days
after NOSENKO returned to the Tourrst Department. This was
their first operational activity since 1959, for they had not
been used in any homosexual operations while i KO was in the
U.S, Embassy Secticn, it was, according to NOSENKO, the last
time they were engaged in KGB activity. At the end of 1962 or
the beginning of 1963 they were terminated, and their files were
s by NOSENKO to KGB archives. NOSENKO explained that VOLKOV
and YEFREMOV had be > too well known for their operational
activities to be of further use to the Secend Chief Directorate.

When NOSENKO was transferred to the Tour:st Department,
he was instructed by the Americar Department Chief, 3.M,
FEDOSEYEV, and V.M. Ki of the U.S. Enbassy Section,
to continue to handle FERRE TG AS REO
studying in Moscow. cecruitedhs
and had used him in the development of U.S, military code
clerk Matthey ZIJUS (see Part V.£.3.c.) in 1961, an operation
which was still underway at_the time of NOSENKO's transfer.
NOSENKO continued to meet GBPS curing the first months of
1962, end he recalled that in February or March of that year
he instructed @EFER to attempt to arrance a social meeting
with ZJJUS in a Moscow restaurant so that another KGB agent .
could be introduced to the KGB target. This meeting had not
taken place by March 1962, when NOSENKO left for Geneva. Just
before leaving Moscow, around 12 March 1962, NCSENKO turned
over to G.I. GRYAZNOV, according to NOSHIKO, then the .
puty Chief cf the U.S. Embassy Section. C23 was scheduled . ,
i : to finish his studies in Moscow in May 1962, and NOSENKO be-
: . lieved he left at that time to return to Syria.

- Department Passport Office indicate that FRIPPEL intended

» -> Marina RYTOVA was turned over to NOSENKO by I.A. KONSTAN-—
TINOV of the Tourist Department in 1956. or 1957. At that time~
she was working as an interpreter at the Russian Permanent
Exhibition in Moscow. In 1960 or 1961 she. became an instructor
of the Greek language at the Institute of International Relations,
and some time in 1962 she got a job at the school of the Central

Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Thereafter :

she ceased all agent work, NOSENKO was officialiy registered as
her case officer until his defection in 1964. He cid not aindi-
cate that RYTOVA took part in any operations, from January 1962
until she began work for the Central Committes. . | °

4. Approach to W.E. JOHNSON

a. NOSENKO's_ Information:

-NOSENKO first. referred to his approach to the American
-tourist Wallace Everett JOHNSON on 1] June 1952.° He did not name
JOHNSON at this time: "In January of this year I recruited /an
American/. I cannot remember his name. He? is from California,

a Baptist, a young guy, healthy, somewhat fat. and he turned out
to be a homosexual.* He loved men, I have an agent network
capable of anything and, in particular, althoush I head a section
there, I have a good agent apparatus, i.e., I have beautiful
girls... and I have young pederasts, homosexuals. In partic-
ular, I have one special pair /VOLKOV and YEFREMOV/ - I'm afraid
that they are known to you and the English... Here is what ©
happened. He gave me a signature. I told him: ‘Write it your-
self.‘ So he typed it on a typewriter. I sara: ‘No, I don't
want it typed. write it out longhand.'... He had a very re-
actionary attitude toward the Soviet Union. His attitude was
such that he insulted us terribly. He visited Baptist groups,
‘churches and... insulted us, Russia, and the coverrment horribly.
He sent letters, and we read them all - awful letters, i.e., the
government is lousy and everything here is poor. I said to him:
"Write, damn it, that the best country /in the world/ is the
Soviet Union, that the best government is the Soviet Government.
Write, write.’ In general he did everything /I asked/ but then, —
right away, he ran to the Embassy_and ‘told everything. This

was in January of this year /1962/. He told everything. I :
know that he told. But he gave me his signature that he would
help the Soviet security organs, ete. I know this. I was
there. I decided to go to the hotel where he was staying. I
sat down and waited. Surveillance was on the job. 'Tell me
when he comes,' /I ordered/. I sat down. ‘'He_has come,’ /the
surveillance_team reported/. ‘where is he?" /I asked/. ‘in

his room,' /they said/. ‘We'll wait,' /i replied/. They re-
ported that he had gone to eat in the restaurant and I went
there at once. He was sitting alone. I approached him:

‘Hello, how are you?' I didn't say anything to him. _I knew
that he had told everything in the Embassy. /I said:/ ‘How .
are you? How about our connection in the States? And our.
work in the States? what do you think about it?‘ I said to
him: ‘Will you work? Can you give us something importent or
not?’ He answered: ‘I have nothing." I said: “And if I

290."

“No,' ne said, ‘I will do anything you.want.' But I couldn't

tell him that I knew that he had reported everything. I said:
_ ‘Listen, brother, I don't believe you. You are a bad person.'
We decided that we couldn't do anything with him. ‘Go home,

damn yo:,' I said, ‘But if you write one irsulting article -
about Russia I will find you, even in the U.S.' He isa
Baptist and writes articles, a bright guy. And I left. He.
pushed aside his food and ran to a pay telephone and called
@the Embassy/: ‘This afternoon in a restaurant George was —
frightening me.‘ We know he called the Embassy. de heard
everything." :

NOSENKO's first reference to CCHNSON in 1964 was at a meet-
ing on 2 february, “nen he produced a note bearing that name and
the date 5 January 1962. “Here I have a name jotted down,
Everett wallace /sic/ JOHNSON," NOSENKO said. "The date was

-5 January 1962, but what took place i have absolutely no recol-

lection. I don't think it was a recruitment, but it Was some

“sort of contact, or he was being’ studied or worked on, or some-

thing like that. But I remember nothing."

NOSENKO next mentioned his epproach to JCHNSON on 17 April
1964. Although net immediately recalling JCHNSON's name, he
eventually rememkered that "it was scmething like JOHNSON,
JOHNSTON, or something that starts with a 'J'" and that he was .
@ Baptist from the California coast. NOSENKO placed the opera-
ticn sometime in the summer of 1962, after his return to Moscow
from Geneva, because he also remenbered wearing “just a coat,
No Overcoat at the time." JOHNSON, who had come to tne Soviet
Union as a tourist, was known to be a socialist, and on this
basis the KGB Second Chief Directorate considered him as a
recruitment target. When the Second Chief Directorate checked
whether the KGB First Chief Directcrate would have any use for
JOHNSON as an agent, however, it learned there was no interest
in JOHNSON: He had no access to important information, and he
lived too far from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United
States for convenient contact.

Several days later KGB surveillance observed JOHNSON
mailing some letters in Moscow. When read by the KGB they were
found to be_"so bitter toward the Soviet Union, angry, critical,.
that they /the KG3/ decided something had to be done" to stop.
him from writing letters and making anti-Soviet statements on
his return to the United States. At about the same time there
was some sign that JOHNSON was a homosexual, and it was decided
to entrap him on this basis. The sole reason was to halt
JOHNSON's criticism of the USSR ~ no recruitment was attempted,
because neither the Pirst nor the Second Chief Directorates
had any use for him as an agent and because the KGB had detere

_ mined that he probably would not accept a recruitment proposal

anyway. NOSENKO did not know why he was selected to make the
approach to JOHNSON, except.that "BOBKOV said I should go."

. JOHNSON became acquainted with VOLKOV and YEFREMOV at the. a ad
Metropol Hotel. They told JCHSSON that they had recently ar- j
‘rived in Moscow and invited JOHISON-to visit their hotel room.
JOHNSON agreed because “they understood each other right away.
They knew they were the same (i.e., homosexuals) and so he came,
and when they were engaged in their business, our people walked
in on them under the disguise of the hotel administrator and .
one militiaman," PYotographs of the incident had been taken,
but these had not been developed at the time of this, the first
confrontation of JOHNSON, A report describing the circumstances
(an akt) was prepared, and JOHNSON was then transferred to another
room. By this time, NOSENKO had arrived at the hotel from his
office, ard he went into the room where JOHNSON was waiting in
accordance with KGB orders. NOSENKO discussed the situation
with JOMISON, then asked him to type and sign a statement that
he would "not say anything derogatory about the Soviet Union."
JOHNSON did as he was told.

The following day, after the incriminating photographs had
been developed, NOSENKO approached JOHNSON in the cafe of the
Metropol Hotel and asked him whether he intended to keep his
promise. When JOHNSON said that he planned to do so, NOSENKO
presented him with an envelope containing copies of the photo-

if JOHNSON were to break his promise. The KG3 later- learned
that JOFNSON had visited (or phoned, according to a later ver-
sion) the U.S. Embassy and assumed that he had reported the
approach. NOSENKO did not recall what name, if any, he had
used during this operation.

Questioned further on 24 April’ 1964, NOSENKO said that,
upen his arrival at the hotel immediately after the compromise, :
the militiaman described the incident to him in JOHNSON's pre- i
sence. Addressing JOHNSON, NOSENKO had said: "How come? How |
could you do such a thing? What are we going to do now? After i
all, this is punishable by court and... people are given from ; |

JOHNSON had written and signed his promise not to denigrate
the Soviet Union in the future, : no,

NOSENKO was asked whether the KGB would mount such an
Operation against any foreigner who wrote uncomplimentary
. -w... letters and articles about the USSR. He replied: "They don't
ie. jump on everyone, and not everyone writes this. way. And not
everything that is written this way gets into their nands.°
In this case there was a coincidence. - There was something we
could hit him on. For instance, if the fact that he is a -

just say: ‘All right, to hell with him. we have to get. rid

‘signal is very. helpful. So if he goes on a Soviet plene, they
will start watching him from the time the flight starts. Now,
as soon as he crosses the torder, he will :be watched by the

“This is a very important busiress, because the main task in re-. ; ‘
gard to tourists is to uncover within the gereral flow of tourists
those persons wao are of interest from the operational point of
view... Let's just say that this person is processing a group
of American tourists who are going to the Soviet Union, and,
7 when the processing is almost finished, another person is added ©
“ to the group. Necbody knows this person in the group... but he
. was added_at the last minute. So this is an indication. This is
what he Lthe agent/ was taught to pay attenticn to when he was
being trained in Moscow... Now, if some official government
agency makes a request that a man ke sent to tne Soviet Union as
.a tourist, this immediately arouses suspicion, of course... In
such things he has been trained... He come3 to Moscow once or
twice a year. You know, such a little Jewisn fellow - an emigre
“from Russia - in the past, you know, scared of everything. The i
. . last time he came he told us: ‘You know, I'm thinking about it ”
. ee all the time,' he says. So they esked him: ‘Are you afraid?
@hy are you shaking?’ He says, ‘Well, T'm not afraid; I'm not
shaking. But why should I be caught like an idiot...‘ His
pseudonym is 'ANUD' and his last name is SVESCHANSKIY. Well,
I'll give you all this later." :

NOSENKO told CIA on 14 February 1964 that SVENCHANSKIY was
_vecruited in 1961 and that in 1963 he, NOSENKO, had taken over .
the handling of this agent from Tourist Department case officer : %
Ye, N. NOSKOV.* SVENCHANSKIY had sent the KG3 many open code ! :
messages such as those described ekove, and a number of these
messages have been considered to have been of definite opera- ‘ '
tional interest. NOSENKO identified SVENCHANSKIY as the presi-
dent of “Afton Tours" in New York City and the owner of a
Russian-language bookstore in Chicago.

i . There was some concern on the part of the KGB at the ‘time
of the recruitment in 1960 or 1961, NOSENKO reported on 1 March-

1965, because SVENCHANSKIY had had contacts with AMTORG in New

: York City. The KGB suspected he was an FBI agent, but in con-

ot tacting SVENCHANSK1Y in 1960 or 1961, NOSKOV decided that this

_ was not so and therefore recruited him. (Asked how it was de-

: termined that SVENGHANSKIY was not an FBI agent, NOSENKO re-
it plied: "NOSKOV felt it;" he had no further explanation.) The
recruitment was based mainly on an agreement that Inturist . {
bone would send more business to SVENCHANSKIY if he cooperated. .
: NOSENKO also said SVENCHANSKIY had been arrested for black-
marketeering, but he did not elaborate on this statement.-
NOSENKO took over the case from NOSKOV in September 1963, and
: i his name was entered ‘in the single-volume file of SVENCHANSKIY it
Poe as the handling officer as of that date. Together with NOSKOV, . . 4

USSR. As of early 1965, SVENCHANSKIY was listed as president of
Afton Tours, inc., New York City, and president of Cross World
Books and Periodicals, Chicago. Afton Tours is a branch of the

of these many suspiciou. contacts, bo 3 First anda the
Second Chief Directorates had come to conclusion that KOTIN
might well pe a provocation atent plan in or recruited from
the ranks cf the Communist -tarty of the United States. More-
over, on the eve of KOVEN’s 1962 trip, the Tourist Department
learned fro V.b. BARKOVSKIY of the First Chrel Directorate's

did not know of any Soviet Intelligence ties to. SOKOLOM,

‘here, the situation is right, the decision must be made right

for technical intelligence;" at the same time the agent had been -
asking to be repatriated to the USSR, to become a Soviet citize:
but the KG had been putting him off in order to continue to
exploit his 2ccess. Since the amount: and quality of the agent's

production had recently deteriorated, the KGB decided to acceée

to his request for repatriation. Now, however, the acent de- : i
clined, saying that "he was not ready to go just yet. First he 3
was pract.cally begging to cone to the Soviet Union ard now he

was balking." This by itself appeared suspicious to the KGB, kut

in addition, it was about this time that the agent came into con-

tact with KOTEN NOSE“KO learned from BARKOVSKIY that KOTEN.

“used to go to some booxstore that sells Soviet literature and

through a saleslady in this story whom KOTEI knows, he became

acquainted with the agent. wio also used to go to this store.

After that, he used to meet with the agent without the saleslady."

On the basis of these incidents the First Chief Directorate
suspected that KOTEI had been directed specifically to this store
in order to meet and “work on" the agent and that, having learned
that the agent had relatives “in Stantsiya Loo, about 17 kilo-
meters from Sochi... he had evidently received the assignment
(to visit the relatives) from American Intelligence. Evidently
they had gotten on the trail of this agent and were checking on
him." The KGB also had suspicions concerning the relatives,
former kulaks who were still well-off financially. It was known.
to the KGB, for example, that the agent hed written his sister i
in Stantsiye Loo that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union, : :
and she had replied: "Is there any sense in your coming here?"

KOTEN arrived in Moscow and then travelled to Sochi. From
there he sent a telegram to the agent's sister and her husband
in Stantsiya Loo, asking them to come to Sochi to see him. When
they arrived at XOTE!'s hote!. however, the hotel administrator
told them that “OTEN was on an excursion and refused to allow }
@ meeting. KOTEIN then took it upon himself to travel to Stant- 1
siya Loo where he eventually contacted and spoxe to the rela- :
tives. In the course of. this meeting KOTEY took photographs
of the sister and her husband ard recorded a message from the ;
sister to the agent on a tape recorder he hed brought along. 5
From this the KGB deduced that "U.S. Intelligence wants to get i
documentary data" and it therefore decided to “try to get hold i
of KOTEN." j

j

There had already been some indication during KOTEN's

‘earlier trips to the USSR that he was a homosexual, but the :

KGB had taken no action because KOTEN was believed to be a .
loyal Communist Party member. With these recent developments, 5
the situation had now changed. Although NCSENKO's superiors. i
were absent from KGA Headquarters at the time, immediate action
was required. NOSENKO consequently “took the whole thing on>

go. American Intelligence is active, none of our -bosses are

now.'" By this time: KOTEN had travelled to Tbilisi, and there
a@ homosexual KGB agent managed to.entice him.into relations - .
in a public park. These: were. suitably documented, ané he was ~

- 8, Arrest of -BARGHOORN.- ©

a. Information. from NOSENKO: -

At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO
described the provocation and arrest of Yale University
Professor Frederick BARGHOORN in late 1963; he was ques-. -
tioned farther on this case on 3 February 1964 and again
while waiting in Frankfurt to leave for the United States.
NOSENKO's most comprehensive statement, from which the
following paragraphs vere largely drawn, was made on 9 June
1964.* On this last occasion NOSENKO said that the pur- : : ‘
pose af the KGB oreration ageinst BARGHOORN was to retaliate i
for persona non grata ection taken against three Soviets . :
in N@w York City in the case’ of John W, BUTENXO and to “+e
secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet in the : i
BUTENKO case who was jailed. In Geneva, however, NOSENKO 7
maintained that the operation against BARGHOORN “was to
discourage future arrests such as that of IVANOV [the
jailed Soviet], not because of any special importance of
IVANOV hinself."

NOSENKO said that in 1963 four KGB First Chief Direc~
torate officers assigned to the New York Legal Residency
were caught in operational activity in the United States.
Of the four, three had diplomatic immunity, but one was a
chauffeur and had only a service passport. The three
Soviet diplomats were held three or four hours by the
American authorities and then released. IVANOV, the chauf-
feur, was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity. **

GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,
learned of this arrest probably the next day and was directed
by KGB Chairman SEWICHASTNYY to take "necessary measures." ; s .
GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office NOSENKO; A.G. Ne
KOVALENKO, Chief of the Tourist Department; and G.I. GRYAZ=
NOV and Ye.M. RASHCHEPOV, both Deputy Chiefs from the Ameri-
can Department. After explaining the arrest, GRIBANOV
asked what information the Second Chief Directorate had on
any American--U.S. Embassy employee or tourist~-that could

*The detail of NOSENKO's information on the BARGHOORN case
reflects both the extent of the CIA debriefings and the
depth of his knowledge of this case. He did, in fact, fur-
nish much of this information during his first 1964 meeting

with CIA. NOSENKO was also able to describe at length. : ote ree rere
BARGHOORN's professional background, which gave rise to KCB “
suspicions of intelligence affiliation, and he provided the “h.
general outlines of cther operational activity centering . : . .

‘ around BARGHOORN during his 1963 trip to the Soviet Union.

**Three Soviets were arrested in Englewood, N.J., on 30 Octo-
ber 1963 during a clandestine meeting with the KGB agent,
BUTENKO, an American engineer. Two of the Soviets,’ G.A.
PAVLOV and Yu.A. ROMASHIN,. were members of the Sovict Mis-
sion to the United Nations; they claimed diplomatic immuni-
ity and were released; a few days later ‘they were declared
persona non grata along with a third Soviet, V.I. OLENEV,

said that at that very moment there were three or four |
American military attaches in Rostov and that, in the
opinion of the American Department, these officers night

had cameres, that they had been taking photccraphs, and that .

they had been observed taxing notes. If permitted, they -
could be arrested in Rostov bevore they took the return
plane to Moscow. GRIBANOY wanted to know what other pos-
sibilities existed and instructed the two representatives
of the American Department to write a report on this. He
also told them to request permission to arrest and searc
the military attaches. | : : i

GRIBANOV then asked what pertinent information was held
by the Tourist Department. He was told that there were re-
latively few American tourists in the Soviet Union at that
time;* these included BARGHOORN, who was mentioned to GRI-
BANOV along with one other (name not. recalled). : NOSENKO and
KOVALENKO reported, however, that the KCB had no "strong"
materials against them. They were ordered to maze an ine»

‘mediate study of the situation and to report buck to GRI-~

BANOV as soon as possible.

Returning to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO and
KOVALENKO gathered the entire American Tourist Section in
their office. In a general discussion, it was decided that
BARGHOORN was the only American on whom the KGB had anything
worth consideration. All the materi&ls on BARGHOORN were
gathered together, and NOSENKO end KOVALENKO took them to
GRIBANOV, explaining that he was the only possibility.
GRIBANOV read all the materials and was pleased with them}...
he was sure that BARGHOORN was connected with American
Intelligence. He then asked what could be done. NOSENKO
and KOVALENKO reported that BARGHOORN was then in Tbilisi
and that, in fact, Ye.N. NOSKOV (case officer, American
Tourist Section) was in Tbilisi with a woman doctor from
the KGB Operational Technical Directorate for the purpose
of working against BARGHOORN; the doctor had some special
item which had been used to make BARGROORN so violently sick
to his stomach that he had to be hospitalized. While he
was in the hospital, a careful search had been nade of his
belongings, but nothing of operational interest had been
found, In addition, a KGB agent was placed in BARGHOORN's
room asa patient; he made anti-Soviet statements ard offered
BARGHOORN "materials," but BARGHOORN did not rise to the
bait. At the time of this meeting with. GRIBANOV, BARGHOORN
was scheduled to fly from Tbilisi to Moscow the following
morning, and the KGB knew. from a phone tap that he had an
appointment with Theodore ORCHARD of the British Embassy
at the Hotel Metropol the following evening.

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving
“paterials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow.. NOSENKO said that this

“, would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that this made

no difference to him. . He instructed NOSENKO and KOVALENKO

materials to BARGHOORN and told them to ‘rite a‘surmary of | |
BARGHOORN's background with a proposal that the Second.

Chief Directorate arrest him “when he obtains materials
which are of ‘interest to American, Intelligence." This was
to be sent in letter form to SEMICHASTNYY over GRIBANOV'S
signature; the letter was not ‘to indicate how BARGHOORN

was to receive the materials (i.e., the-fact of provocation
was not to be mentioned).

GRIBANOV took a one-page letter on SARGHOORN, along we ates
with a similar letter from GRYAZNOY and RASHCHEPOV con~ : :
cerning the military attaches, to SEMICHASTNYY. While

the four--NOSENKO, KOVALENKO, GRYAZNOV ard KOVALENKD=~

were waiting in GRIBANOV's office for his return, GRYAZNOV
received a telephone call from the local xCB organization

in Rostov informing him that the military attaches were in

the air on their way back to Moscow. Shortly thereafter, -
GRIBANOV returned with the news that the Chairman of the KGB

had approved the arrests of the military attaches as well

as BARGHOORN. {KHRUSHCHEV was absent fron Moscow at the

time, but SEMICHASTNYY had called BREZHNEV and secured his
approval. *)

When GRIBANOV learned from GRYAZNOV that the military
attaches were already on their way back to Moscow, he be~
came furious and sent GRYAZNOV out "to do the job or die."
Meanwhile, arrangements were made with the “Department DP"
(the KGB element responsible for disinformation, subordinate
to the First Chief Directorate) to provide’ some materials
on rockets which could be passed to BARGHOORN. While these
were being picked up, NOSENKO and KOVALENKO returned to
their office to plan the provocation.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance upon
this arrival in Moscow. At 1810 hours a radio message was
received from one of the surveillance cars that BARGHOORN
had gone to the U.S. Embassy, and it was decided that the
agent (name not recalled, aged 25 to 30 years) would be
placed in contact with him as soon as he came out. The
KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appointment with ORCHARD of the
British Embassy at 1900 hours, but at.1900 hours a report
_was received that BARGHOORN had left the U.S. Embassy in
the American Ambassadcr's car. He was elone but for the
Soviet driver. Nothing could be done while BARGHOORN was in
the moving car. A check on ORCHARD established that he was
in the downstairs hall of the hotel waiting. It was there-
fore decided to approach BARGHOORN when he left the car at : vedi
the hotel. : -

*NOSENKO placed these events on the day before BARGHOORN re=-
turned to Moscow from Tbilisi and on the day before BARGHOORN

_. was arrested. As indicated below, BARGHOORN returned from

&lma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October 1963 and was arrested.on . :

_; A surveillance car pulled up. BARGHOORN was placed in the
car, handcuffed (on GRIBANOV's orders, because the Soviets
arrested in the United States had received similar treat-

a ‘room had been prepared.

Lote, hours the next day. Although BARGHOORN speaks good Russian,
YEFREMOV remained in case he would be needed to interpret.
NOSENKO entered the room sevcral times during these sessions.
(Although NOSENKO did not want to reveal his face to BARG-
HOORN because he knew BARGHOORN would be released, GRIBANOV
had. told KOVALENKO that NOSENKO should be there when they ~ :
reached the point where BARGHOORN was to tell how he obtained
the damaging materials.) The first. sessions concentrated

: on general matters, such as BARGHOORN's life history. *

- ‘After one and one half hours of questioning, BARGHOORN
_agreed that the materials were on him when he was arrested,
but he maintained that they had been placed on his person.
-,He said that he thought they were "newspapers or something,"

, hat: he did not know what they were. The closed package
was then opened and shown to BARGHOORN; it contained about
*20 to 25 pages of information on missiles. ."BARGHOORN
“was not, of course, given a close look" at the materials.

The Cra interviewer ‘then read to him, the. report

the date of the. approach as 5 January 1962z, the date contained
in NOSENKO's notes, and indicated that -NOSZKO used the name
NIKOLAYEV. (see below). Acknowledging that “maybe” he had used’
the name Georgiy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV with. JOHNSON, NOSENKO
said: “I don't know why I made this mistake with the dates. I

think it (the approach) was the first or second. day that -I was in

the Seventh (Tourist) Departmenz. I saw myself that he had
(homosexual) intercourse... . Your @ate is absolutely right, but
this reminded me that it was soon after I had come in the
Seventh (Tourist) Department. Is this important?"

Question: How long had you been in the Seventh Department?

NOSENKO: . Now I remember that it was immediately - one or two
“ days. %I know I returned in January 1962. 2 knew I

would be going to the Seventh (Department) alréady in
December. I was visiting the Seventh @lready then.
I had not too many papers to turn over to the First ©
(American Department), and now I remember that I
moved to the Seventh immediately (NOSENKO's emphasis)
after 1 January 1962.

b. Information from JOHNSON:

JGHNSON reported to the U.S, Embassy in Moscow on 5 January
1962 that he experienced an "incident with Soviet plainclothes-
men in the Hotel Metropol earlier that day." JCHNSON, who
arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961, told the consular officer
that “he was dining alone in the Hotel Metropol restaurant the
evening of 4 January when he was joined at his table by a Soviet
citizen who identified himself as a doctor from Riga. (This
was NOSENKO's homosexual agent VOLKOV.) According to JOHNSON,
little conversation transpired because the Riga ‘doctor’ spoke
English poorly. Before JOHNSON left, however, the ‘doctor'
said he would like to chat with him and knew a student who
spoke English well. JOHNSON then agreed to come by the ‘doc-
tor's' room at the Metropol at 10:00 a.m. the next day. JCHNSON
said that he dropped by the ‘doctor's’ room about 10:00 the
morning of January 5. Soon after he entered, the ‘doctor’ and
his ‘student' friend (NOSENKO's homosexual agent YEFREMOV)
began to make homosexual advances to him. He stated that he
protested and was rising to leave when two plainclothesmen
suddenly appeared in the room and announced that all were under
arrest. JOHNSON was then taken to another room where he was
asked to sign a statement in Russian... He signed this state-

" ment and was taken to a man in a third room who identified him-

self as the Chief of Police, Georgiy Ivanovich NIKOLOV.* The
police chief first told him that Soviet law had been violated
and that he, JOHNSON, could be imprisoned for three, five, or
perhaps even eight years. After proceeding in this vein for

“1% . NOSENKO frequently used the operational pseudonym Yuriv

Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV. He has said that he was normally
ealled Georgiy, a variation of Yuriy, by family and friends
in Moscow. ©

people, mostly “minister friends" abroad; apparently he did not

5. Attempt to Recruit BRAUNS
a. Information from NOSENKO:

NOSENKO made the following statement on 2 February 1964:
"In 1962 come U.S. citizen by the name of Horst BRAUNS came to
the Soviet Union. I mentioned him to you in 1962 but at that
time could not recall his name.* we tried to recruit him but
did not succeed. He lived somewhere in ieningred, and in 1942
he went back with the German troops to Germeny. And he served -
in the.German Army, and after the war Le changed his name and
went to the USA and became a U.S. citizen. is either @

NOSENKC wert into the operation against 2RAUNS in greater

detail on 17 April 1964: “This was /K.G./ KRUPNOV's case.

This fellow was a Russian and lived prior tc the war in Lenin-

grec. In. 1942 he was in Tikhvin, near Leningrad,,when the

Germans came, and when the: Germans were retreating they toox

himself in Germany. Now, in Germany, as. he told his story, he — -

In February 1965 NOSENKO said he had forgotten how he came

“to be involved in the BRAUNS cease. He also said that he did

mot know why BRAUNS had visited Scviet Union, and that he
could not name any Soviet citizens with whom FRAUNS was in con-

, Following BARGHOORN' s adnission, another resolution

|. was drawn up by KRUPNOV and signed by KRUFNOV, KOVALENKO,

and GRIBANOV. NOSENKO and KAUPNOV then took it to the. office.
of the Chief Prosecutor where the incident report, the first.
interrogation, and the first and second resolutions were
reported to (fnu) MISHUTIN (or MISHUSTIN), the First Deputy
to the Chief Prosecutor. GRIBANOV further directed that all
materials on BARGHOORN, including information from KGB
Archives, be given to the Department of Prosecution of the
KGB so that they could begin the legal proceedings against
BARGHOORN, After this, all-interrogations were conducted

by this department; KRUPNOV: was dropped from the case,

but YEFRENOV continued to act as interpreter.

b. Information from BARGHOORN

BARGHOORN, who had made five earlier trips to the
Soviet Union since 1955, arrived there on 2 October 1963.
The purpose: of his visit, as stated in his visa application,
was to gather information for a book on how effectively the
Soviet Union was operating as a result of its political ed~
ucation and political system. His itinerary took hin to
Leningrad from 2 to 7 October, to Moscow from 7 to 10 Octo-
ber, Tbilisi from 10 to i7 October, and short visits to
Tashkent, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Alma-Ata from 17 to 25
October. He flew from Alma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October and
was scheduled to leave for Warsaw on 31 October. On the
latter date he was arrested and held by tne KGB until
16 November when, at President Kennedy's intervention, he
was released and left the Soviet Union. BARGHOORN had no
intelligence mission.

Upon his return to the United States, BARGHOORN was
debriefed by the U.S. Department of State and by CIA. His
information indicated a high degree of KGB operational in-’
terest in him throughout the trip, including.encounters with
at least five probable KGB agents during his first week
there: an attractive waitress who invited him to "do the
town," a disenchanted intellectual in Leningrad, an attrac-—
-tive unattached girl who sat next to him on the flight from
Moscow to Tbilisi, and two young Armenians whom he met his
first day in Tbilisi.* The two Armenians were instrumental
in the drugging described by NOSENKO. At dinner’ in his
hotel on the day he arrived in Tbilisi, BARGHOORN met a.
young man claiming to be a student at the Leningrad Music
Conservatory. They left the hotel for a walk and ran into
a friend of the student, a second young Armenian, and the
three of them went to a.cafe for coffee. None was available, —

*Questioned about this in February 1965, NOSENKO said that
BARGHOORN, as a suspected American Intelligence agent, was

of operational interest throughout the trip. He vaguely re-
ealled the girl on the plane but either did not know or -had
forgotten details of any other specific activity... NOSENKO
said that none of this activity was directly related to the .-
provocation operation, which. was: based. ona. last-minute ‘de-.
cision. 7. an : : . . : aa

but the young student went to the kitchen "to arrange things,” © . re

and shortly thereafter "three foul-tasting coflees" appeared...
Within an hour, BARGHOORN was.in the hospital, acutely-ill.

He wag assigned. to a room where there was another patient,

and a woman doctor took care of his.case. Ile was in the
hospital for four days. During this period his. clothes, .
notes, and other possessions were held by. hospital authori- -~
ties. . :

Upon his return to Moscow by air on 25 October,. BARG-, -
HOORN checked into the Metropol Hotel. The next six days
‘were occupied by sightseeing and appointments connected with
his’ research, ‘In the late afternoon of 31 October he called
on. friends at the U.S, Embassy for cocktails, and at 1910,
already 10 minutes late, he left in the Ambassador's car for
a dinner appointment (prearranged by telephone) at the Metro-

pol with Theodore ORCHARD, a British diplomat.

BARGHOORN's account of the subsequent events closely
parallels NOSENKO's. Having been handed the incriminating
materials, he was arrested, handcuffed, and taken to Militia
Station No. 58, where he was questioned briefly by a uni-
formed Militia officer. The KGB was called. Within 30
minutes a KGB captain (BARGHOORN thought his name night
have been GORBUNSKIY) arrived and began to question him,
assisted by an interpreter named YEFREMOV.* Ail question
were asked in Russian, and BARGHOORN answered nost of them
in English. The package of materials was opened and con-
tained, according to BARGHOORN, 13 or 14 photographs of
rockets. This session lasted until about midnight and
centered around BARGHOORN'’s possession of the photographs
and his “intelligence mission." He was then taken to the
Lyubyanka prison. :

Interrogations were conducted the next morning by the
original KGB officer together with his "chief," whom BARG-
HOORN subsequently identified by photograph as NOSENKO. The

"| questioning concerned BARGHOORN's biography, and nothing was : ?

asked about the compromising materials. The foliowing day

the case was turned over to a KGB colonel identified as (fnu)-
PETRENKO, and BARGHOORN did not see NOSENKO or the other KGB
officer again. At this and subsequent sessions, BARGHOORN

was questioned further concerning the circumstances of his
arrest. BARGHOORN described NOSENKO as “clever and quick-
witted" and as ziving "the impression that he vas not a :
dedicated careerist, but opportunistic and adaptive; he -
seemed not to care about what he was doing, but doing a good.
job nevertheless."

*Asked why YEFREMOV used his true name during the interro-
gations, NOSENKO said this was necessary for legal reasons,.
that he had to sign documents connected. with the interroga-
tions. BARGHOORN confirmed that.’ ‘YEFREMOV had participated
throughout the. entire. series of. interrogations and had

lo. BOLSHAKOY, Robert ‘Kennedy, and the cuban Missile ‘cris is

a. Introduction -

NOSENKO volunteered at his s+cond meetmg with CIA
in January 1964 that G.N. BOLSHAKOY was his “old friend”
and that he was a colonel in the GRU. On. 26 January,
1 February, and 19 August 1964 he again raised BOLSHAKCV’s

‘name, emphasizing that he was a GRU officer and a "good

friend." In the 1 February interview, after displaying an.
initial reluctance to discuss with CIA-such a “sensitive”
subject, he provided a number of details on BOLSHAKOV's
alleged relationship in 1962 with the then Attorney General,
Robert Kennedy. His information on this subject, he said,
derived from his friendship with BOLSHAXOV in Moscow, where
BOLSHAKOV was reassigned (in December 1962 following a tour
in Washington as Novosti correspondent and editor of the
magazine USSR). XOSENKO claimed a personal role in this
affair, in That: he personally proposed to the KGB leader-
Ship that the KGB. take over BOLSHAKOV's former (GRU) con-
‘tact with Robert Kennedy.

NOSENKO claimed that an information channel of con-
munication between BOLSHAKOV and-the Attorney Ceneral had
developed at Kennedy's initiative. He described in detaii
the circumstances of their introduction at a social function
by a journalist (whom he did not name). He said that he
"thought" that the Kennedys knew that BOLSHAKOV was a
‘military intelligence officer," and he implied that they
regarded these private conversations with BOLSHAKOV as a
useful instrument of diplomacy. According to NOSENKO, the
KGB knew that CIA was not aware of this relationship--it
was "obvious" that Robert Kennedy wanted it that way.-_
NOSENKO claimed that after BOLSHAKOV left the United States
“during the Cuban missile crisis,"* no one took over his
role as a confidential channel to the White House. After
the assassination of the President, NOSENKO continued, the
Kennedy family tried to reestablish the relationship through
their close triend, the artist William. WALTON, during the
latter's visit to Moscow in December 1963, NOSENKO reported
that he had urged that the KGB try to take over the Rotert
Kennedy operation from the GRU and that he had proposed two
plans which would have enabled this to take place, the ©
second involving WALTON, Neither came to fruition, however.

Referring to the Cuban missile crisis, NOSENKO said that the _

:

GRU had “played dirty" with BOLSHAKOV by forcing him to “tell

Robert" that there were no offensive missiles in Cuba. whereas :

there actually were such weapons there.

According to other sources, BOLSHAKOV left Washington
for Moscow on 3 August 1962 and returned on 2 ‘October 1962.
On 23 August, about the time that CIA was reporting urgently
to the President that "something new and different" was
going on with respect to Soviet aid to Cuba, Anbassador
DOBRYNIN assured Theodore SORENSEN (Special Counsel to the
President) that the United States had no need to fear Soviet

the same day, the President stated publicly that the United
States had no proof of a Soviet offensive missile capability

in Guba. Also on the sane day, the Sovict Union sent 2

harsh pote to the U.S, Government concerning the (uninten-
ticnal) violation of Soviet airspace by an American U-2

plane on 36 August; the note threatened “appropriate Ye=
telistory measures" against U-2 bases should such incidents

be repeated, The following day (5 September) U-? flights

over Cuba were tenporarily suspended, and they did not re=-

sume until 14 October, On 6 September PORRYNIN again told
SORENSEN that the Soviets had “done nothing new’ in Cuba

and gave his assurances that all their steps"were defensive

in nature ard did not represent any threat to...the United
States." On 13 October DOBRYNIN informed Chester BOWLES (a8
Special Representative and Advisor to the President) that

the USSR would never send offensive weapons to Cuba, Sini-

lar assurances were given by KHRUSHCHEY to U.S. Ambassador
KOHLER in Moscow on 16 Octcber (the same day that the Pregi-
dent was shown the Ue2 photographs which revealed the pre=
sence of offensive missiles) and by Foreign Minister GRONYXO

b. Soviet Soure.-3 During the Crisis

NOSENKO has rot indicated that BOLSEAKOV had an infor- :
mation-collection role during the Cuban misstle crisis. As : , :
for Soviet sourc+s at this time, NOSENKO stated on several :
occasions in 1964, if different centexts, that the KGR “had
not had luck in getting intelligence from high places in
the U.S. Government" in Octobex 1462, On sore than one oc~
casion he said that the KUB agent “SASHIA'** was unable to .
furnish any information of value in this régard. le said
this on 25 February 1964 und again while being questioned
about "SASHA" on 4 August 1964. On the latter date NOSENKO -
said: "During the Cuban missile crisis the [KCB] First
Chief Directorate, the Intelligence, couldn't tell what the
U.S. will do. KNRUSHCHEV*** was rot satisficd with the work
of the Intelligence, No agents were producing inforsaticn
on this." NOSENKO coitinued by saying that "SASHA" reo .
ported nothing to the KGB during the Cuban missile crisis.

In fact, “he couldn’: know anything. 1 heard that this was

very tightly held information, here wore just 2 tew

people around President Kennedy who knew the plans, and they
. Were sworn to keep it secret."

*2INCHUK was: identificd ty DERYABIN by name ard photograph
in October 1954 as a KCB staff officer, NOSENKO has said
that ZINCHUK was a KGB cooptce rather than a staff officer.

tion had been received, KHRUSHCHEY stated, on the morning

- YoSENKO's Statements on BOLSHAKOV

Co.

tion and the fact that the KCB was in no way involved in

“¢his channel to the U.S. Government via Robert Kennedy. _
He first volunteered BOLSUAKOV's naze during a discussion |
of the use of Novosti as a cover organization for Soviet :
Intelligence officers. “Yuriy BOLSHAKOV of the GRU also
sits there,” he said. “He is a colonel and a friend of
mine." Two days tater, out of context with the preceding -
discussion, he introduced the name again: “Then there is
this BOLSHAKOV. He is from GRU who was in the United
States." NOSENKO then commented that this was "a very in-
teresting case" and added: “We shall talk about it later."
When his case of1icer trereupon turned to another tcpic,
NOSENKO immediately interrupted to say: “IL know BOLSHAKOV
very well, He is my old friend...] met him through Yuriy —
GUK,..[who}was with him in the United States...and we are

* now very good friends. He calls me up and consults me for
advice... On 1 February 1964 NOSENKO said he thought the
Kennedy family knew BOLSHAKOV to be a military inteiligence
officer; “yet for some reason they chose him" as a channel
between the U.S. and Soviet Governments. BOLSHAKOV, NO-
SENKO added, “reported directly" to the Chief of the GRU
concerning his exchanges with Robert Kennedy.

NOSENKO repeatedly emphasized BOLSHAKOV's GRU affilia-

NOSENKO said BOLSHAKOY was introduced to Robert Kennedy
. by an American journalist (unnamed) at @ reception in the
United States. The journalist invited BOLSHAKOV to go for
a walk, and as they strolled “down an alley," there was a
man sitting on a bench direct] ahead of them. "The jour-
nalist said: ‘Listen, Ceorge BOLSHAKOV|, are you acquainted.
with Robert Kennedy, the brother of the President and the
Chief of the Department of Justice?! BOLSHAKOV said: ‘No.
Of course, 1 have heard of him,' ‘Would you like me to
introduce you?! ‘Of course,’ BOLSHAKOV said, ‘please do.'
He led him to the man on the bench. There was this feeling
that all this had been pr2-arranged."

This contact"was at the personal desire of Bob Kennedy...
- BOLSHAKOV was called ia for this. As you know, the whole
idea of this contact was to pass information to Kennedy
‘from KI'RUSKCHEV and from Kernedy, to KHRUSHCHEV....It happened
to be BOLSHAKOV, but it was not BOLSHAKOV who sought to
have the meeting....Then the relationship grew. BOLSHAKOV
was_a visitor in Robert Kennedy's hnouse. Th2y would first
talk about ordinary things, and then the conversation—- coven
turned to other mattsrs...Robert Kennedy did not say: .
"Please tell KHRUSHCHEV so-and-so.’ He would say: "You
know, some of these problems seen insoivable." = And BOL-
SHAKOV would say: ‘And you know, at home they think this
and that way...’ without actually saying that this was coming
from KHRUSHCHEV. But, of course, this was clear without
explanations. It was ar exchange of views on important poli-
tical questions of the moment. He was like an intermediate
point...” NOSENKO commented that he personally thought
that. it was a "case of mutual tfeelers' being sent out ‘by
. both sides--exploring some given current political situation.”

After BOLSHAKOV left Washington, KOSENKO stated

departure, NOSENKG said: “Oh, no... There is ‘no contact.”

‘like there wab before, [t was broken. at the time BOL-

SHAKOV left. | ZIXCWUY was an agent or a cooptce....No,
there is no such contact since BOLSHAKOY left. He passes

Referring to the Kennedy-BOLSHAKOV ‘contacts; NOSEXKO
told CIA on 26 January 1964: “You have shown. considerable
interest in him | BGLSIAKOV], even after his return to the
Soviet Union,..because all this was done by by-passing CIA." | :
He said on 1 February 1964: "It was pretty obvious-that oa, . 5
this relationship between BOLSHAKOV and Robert Kennedy had © . : 3
nothing to do with CIA, and CIA was not witting of it. It
was at the perscnal desire of Bob Kenredy." The KGS
determined that CIA was unaware of the exchange between
Kennedy and BOLSHAXOV, NOSENKO reported, because when BOL-

SHAKOV was subsequently invited to a reception at the U.S.

Psektee cation Lemna dee,

Embassy in Moscow, two CIA officers--Kenneth A. KERST and

Malcolm A, TOON*--tried to slicit information from him
- about his relatiorship with President Kennedy. "The most.

important thing" they had tried to find out, according to
NOSENKO, was whether the President and BOLSHAKOV had met
personally. Although BOLSHAKOV did :not adnit the fact to
them, he did have one meeting with President Kennedy-~"he
was brought in a car...and was taken through a back door
into the White House,"' NOSENKO said.

NOSENKO reported that William WALTON visited Moscow ‘in Decem- ,
ber 1963 and at that time went to BOLSHAKOV, whom'he had “

‘previously met at the home of Robert Kennedy. Part of

their conversations, he continued, related to Robert Kennedy's

future political plans: ‘WALTON said that Boboy...did not

expect at present to become a candidate for the vice presi-

dency. He was, perhaps, according to WALTON, thinking of ;
running for Goversor of Massachusetts..." NOSENKO said he :
felt that there were "some feelers sent out on the part of

WALTON~-not exactly questions, but just a passing of opinion.

WALTON was trying to sound them out, but I think that every~

thing was left without an answer....My personal opinion. was

7 _ that these things were told to WALTON so that ke could pass
’ them on as, so to speak, Bouby's plans for the future."

‘no Russian involvement in’ the murder“of-the-President:---No-- — mere ones

Another topic covered in the WALTON-BOLSHAKOV discussions,

NOSENKO added, was the assassination of President Kennedy.** i
‘As I remember, it was WALTON's opinion--and his opinion re- vo
flected the opinion of the Kennedy family--that there was

¢

suspicion at all."

NOSENKO proposed two plans whereby the EGB could take
over the GRU's channel to President Kennedy. Under the
first of these plans, the Soviet Minister of Justice would
personally invite the Attorney General to come’ to. ‘the Soviet.
Union. There the KGB would "set him up. in private. living. Lo
quarters, give his everything he wants..-S0 that: he would be... ve

Lut just to prosete a rapprechenent." Ia add1tioa,) on the.
basis of what LOLSHAKOV had told SUSENKO about. "Sbert -
Kennety's toterest tn a Sovier ballerina, this plen called
for the two to vv brought together, and the ballertra; who
“Is quite free in her bebavior sith the Sppostic sen,”
would do “everything neccessary. for the State." Sefore
NOSENKO's superiors could make a decision on this plan, :
the President was assassinated and the ~atter vas dropped.
NOSENKO conceived his second plan during WALTON's trip to
_¥9scow in December .19C3: "“BOLSHAKOY told me that ho wag
going. to reet WALTON, and asked ne whether we had an ins
terest in it....I told the chiefs about it and said: 'Ret's
utilize WALTON oursclvcs. Why should we let the GRU use
hin?'™ NOSENKO suggestcd that the KGB “tell BOLSIAKOV
that we are working on PALTON--that-this 4s a Number One
target 73 far as we are concerned, ROLSHAKOV will do any-~
_zhing we ask him." However, “the boss. said: ‘Well, you : - . me
‘know, it will worsen relations between the KGB and’ the GRU,
48 long as they are working op it, let then do it.'"

NKO indicated that If the KGB had actually essuned
authority for the opcration in Moscow iroa the GRU, as he
had proposed, the KGB Legal Pesidency in Washington would
Dave then taken over, and "someone new" probably would have
been sent from KG3 Headquarters to develop the association.
this NGB officer would lave been “someone with a broader
outlook who covld carry himself well in social contacts."

"recently" turned over to BOLSHAKOV an informant sto was
ondent based in Washington. This jour-
mance had accompanied Vice President Nixon
to the USSR in July 1559 and while there had agreed to coop-
. erate by "furnishing political information." ‘BOLSHAKOV was
: to “concentrate all of his efforts on this one contact,"*

NOSENKO"'s- KGB. Promot ions~and--Awar

“Le Rank : ; i

. _ NOSENKO has. been questioned at length concerning his ae
* progress tnrough the KG3 ranks, from lieutenant to lieuten-
“ant colonel. He has volunteered additional information.on we po
.this subject himself, iis various statements follow in : :
chronological order.

sete ne nth Bag id

11 June 1962: "As a Chief of Section, I now receive
2,500 [rubles per month], plus 700 for my rank, for major,
plus pay for longevity. 1! receive more t..an 4000, i.e.,
450-470-450 [rubles per month] in new money. This is
enough for me...J am now a major but I should receive
lieutenant colonel soon. 1 have already completed my time
in grade. We have a system of tine in grade. From major
to lieutenant colonel] it is necessary to have four years...

oom My time in grade was up “in December, in December of last ~~ —

year [1961]."

23-January 1964: At the first of his 1964 meetings
with CIN yn Geneva NOSENKO had in his possession the ten-
porary duty authorization which he said he had been issued
in December 1963 to travel Zrom Moscow to Gorkiy Oblast in
connection with the search for CHEREPANOV.* This official
¥KGH paper had been signed by O.M. GRKIBANOV, Chief of the
Second Chief Directorate, and authorized. "Licutenant Colonel
Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO to visit the local KGB organiza—-
tion in Gorkiy Oblast on official business between 15 and
30 December 1963." It bore official stamps of arrival and
departure in December 1963, as attested by officials in the
town of Shakhunya.

10 February 1964: In Frankfurt, while awaiting ex-
filtration to the United States, NOSENKO was asked to review
a biographic statement which had been prepared by his case
officers on the basis of statements he had made during the
1962 and 1964 meetings in Geneva. NOSENKO went over the
_. biography carefully, noted several changes, and then stated
i that it was correct. The biography included the information
that NOSENKO had served in the U.S. Embassy Section of the
American Department as a senior lieutenant from 1952 [sic]
to 1955, that he was promoted to captain in 1956, to major : : :
in 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963, shortly — : :
before leaving Moscow for Geneva. : :
: 8 April 1964: NOSENKO was questioned about the date
when He became a senior lieutenant, and he replied: "I
think in the end of '53 or the beginning of '54 I got the .
senior lieutenant." H

NOSENKO: I don't remember. You see, they are not given :
rs exactly in February or in March. Sometimes the ; 5
scheduled time passes before they give it. So,
'56.-Captain, '59--Major, and '63--...

; 16 June 1964: Asked to list in chronological order the
date of his promotions within the KGB from the date of

entry, NOSENKO stated: “I began in the GRU as a junior
lieutenant. While in the. GRY I became a lieutenant, and I
entered the KGB with this rank in 1953, Not long after I
entered the KGB I became a senior lieutenant, but 1 don't
know the month. It was still 1953. In 1956 I was promoted
to the rank of captain. 1 don't know the month, I became
a major in 1959. I don't know the’month. In October 1963
1 we« made x licutenant colonel....Personnel called me on
the v.elephene and said I had been promoted. Later I was
told that GRIBANOV wanted to see me. I went to his office,
but, of course, I didn't let hin know that I already knew

. that I had been promoted. He gave me his congratulations.

You never see the attestation. It goes into your official
file."

26 January 1965: While discussing his role as case
officer for U.S. Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN,
NOSENKO volunteered out of context that he had never offi-
cially been a major. He explained this situation as
follows: Having been promoted to the rank of senior
lieutenant in April 1953, he vecame eligible for the rank
of captain in 1956. When this time came, however, he was

‘not promoted because a senior KGB official held against

him his illegal use of KGB documents to cover treatment for
gonorrhea in 1954, NOSENKO therefore remained a senior

lieutenant until 1959, when he would have been eligible

for promotion to the rank of major had he received his

captaincy on schedule. Although GRIBANOV had promised NO-.

SENKO that he would be promoted directly from senior lieu~

tenant to major, skipping the rank of captain, an admini-

strative error was made by the KGB Personnel Office, and .

NOSENKO found when the orders were issued that he had in- Cae
stead been promoted only to captain. Instead of rectifying : :
this mistake, GRIBANOV persuaded NOSENKO that it would be

to his advantage to remain a captain until he became eligible

for promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1963. NOSENKO- there—

fore was a captain from September or October 1959 until

October 19643 when, as promised by GRIBANOV, he was promoted

1400000

turned jut: that he never officially held the’ ‘rank ‘of major. *

7 10 August 1965: Under ques ioning by. DERYABIN, NOSENKO © .

: repeated the chronology of his promotions. given an 26 January eo 4
1865. He again explained that he:was put up for captain tn os oy

1956, but this time said that the-promotion had been blocked ~ ol, .

on the grounds that he should be made to wait because of . : Sone
shortcomings in his work. Asked why he: had told CIA that he
had been a major during the 1962 meetings and again in the
“biography prepared’ in Frankfurt, NOSENKO: replied: that he
thought the true story would not be believed.

17 April 1966; In a voluntary statement, NOSENKO wrote

the following: Yn March 1951, with the rank of junior licu- '

tenant, I started service in Naval Intelligence of the Seventh. : . :

Flect in Sovetskaya Gavan....Fronm August 1952 until 1955, 1. ae =

lieutenant of the Administrative Service....In 1956 I received

the rank of senior licutenant [in the KGB], .in December 1959

the_rank of cnptain, and at the end of 1963 1 was recommended

’ for the rank of major. I lave never held the rank of lieuten.
ant colonel] ond the travel order which you know of, with the
rank of lieutenant coloncl, was filled out erroneously, **

-19 April 1966: In a new version of his autobiography,
NOSENKO included the following statement: “in July 1956 1 -
became a candidate member of the CPSU, soon after which I ree
ceived a promotion at work: I became a senior case officer
and was given the rank of senior licutenant. In August 1957
I was accepted into the CPSU, and during the second half of
1958 was appointed Deputy Chief of the: Second Section, Seventh
Department. On 29 December 1959 1 was promoted to the rank of
captain. nm

26 October 1966: "I lied when I said I was a lieutenant a
colonel In I967.” T was only a captain." Asked why he had : :
‘., said in 1962 that he was then a major, NOSENKO replied: -
. “There was no conversation about rank in 1962. About my po~
sition, I said I was in the Tourist Department. That's all."

To summarize what NOSENKO has said about his ranks while.
‘serving in the KGB: He became a senior iicutenant in 1952, “ . :
April 1953, 1954, or 1956; a captain in 1956 or September/Octo-= : \
per/December 1959; a major in December 1958 or 1959; and a oe
lieutenant colonel in October/November 1963, (The latter rr
clain was verificd by the official KGB document listing him as
a lieutenant colonel as of December 1963.) On the other hand, _.

NOSENKO has indicated that his highest rank in the KGB was - oT ot
captain, and that he never advanced to a majority or a lieue .- -
tenant colonelcy.

GRIBANOV decided that whoever is working a long

You received the Order of Lenin for this brilliant
service?

No. For working in the Seventh [Tourist] Depart-
ment, which is considered good.

What is good? Were there recruitments? What
recruitments?

You must know that the main task of the Seventh
Department is rot recruitments. The main task is
countering the intelligence activities of the op-
position.

So, the Chief and the Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Department got the Order of Lenin?

Yes.

*NOSENKO has described the Order of Lenin as the highest
decoration for which a KGB officer can be eligible. — .

#sIn June 1964 KOSENKO said that the only Second Chief Direc-

We decided on these ind: uals. As far as we
ourselves were concerned. thut decision was made

: Question: Did the Seventh Department catch any spies?

NOSENKO: Well, as I have already told you, there was this
"Italian fellow &35—: This was considered a
good case because the First Department later--
the Seventh Department sas only’ involved at the
time of the arrest--began mecting with him. co : .

Question: So you got the Order [of the Red Banner] in 1962
: because of yuur work in the Tourist Department?

NOSENKO: I think: in 1962 GRIBANOV gave it to me not for
. . the Seventh Department, but for my work in the
First [American] Departrent in 1960, 1961.

‘Question: You think so? |
NOSENKO:: I think so, . |

Question: And the Order of Lebin was the asta?

NOSESKO: - The sare.’ Well, the way it saye,”:

cation exactly what it fo for

-  NOSENKO admitted on 8 April 10643. ''In 1964 { in ‘Goneva] oo

-1 told 9 Iie about the: Order of Lenin,...Why?. It wa: Se
borst." NOSENKO then explained what ‘he said to be the true .
circumstances and gave. the reason for whiob he was to have. -
received thig decoration. GRIBANOV, NOSENKD. ateted, had”
proniged in 1983 that NOSENKO, CHRLNOXOV). and KOVALENKO .

would get the Order of Lenin: “He eaid: tT an submitting

‘your names for the Order of Lenin for orsating ths TaOP8
fcentral Operational Communications System of the Socond

Chief Directorate}, ‘for this new thing you have tried to

create in tourist work.' But December {i503} had gone bye:

I left [for Goneva] and nothing happoacd."* — . oo

NOSENKO was asked on 15 April 1964 to list the dates,
reasons, and types of awards, decorations, and bonuses be
had received during his KGB career, as well as to indicate

a from whom he had received eaoh of these. Risa reply was .

. as follows: "I received nothing in 1953, 1954, and 1955,
In 1956 I received a commendation and one, month's pay. -
SEROV, the Chairman of the KGB, awarded ne this for the
recruitment of Richard BURGI [see Part V.D.4.b.}] while I°
was working in the Seventh [Tourist] Department of the
Second Chief Directorate. It was signed by the Chairman,
and GRIBANOV told me about it. Aa usual, this Order of
the Chairman of the KGB waa circulated, and I ind 411 case
officers saw my name listed. There is no cértificste or

‘WithGRIBANOV. —
“1. “Information from NCSENKO

a. Summary

From the time of his first meetings with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO
maintained that he had a close personal and profersional relation- :
ship with Major General 0.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of tre Second Chief. — : 4
Directorate. NOSENKO has described recruitment approaches in. which ,
he and GRIBANOV took part together, conversations they had on opera-
tional matters, the role which GRIBANOV played in his rank promo- :
tions and receipt of various awards, and his afterhours carousing . :
with GRIBANOV and First Chief Directorate ceuntcrinteiligence
officer Ye.A. TARABRIN. NOSENKO has also frequently mentioned the
role which GRIBANOV played in nis, NOSENKO's, professional advance-
ment within the KGB: GRIBANOV was wholly respensible, against
NOSENKO's wishes, for his appointment to the position of Deputy ’
Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department in
January 1969; later, when NOSENKO rejected his offer to make him
Leputy Chief of the entire American Depertment, GRIBANOV arranged
his return to the ‘tourist Department as Chief of the American
Tourist Secticr. and his later appointment as Deputy Chief of the
Tourist Department.

NOSENKO's remarks concerning nis direct involvement with

GRIBANOV in operations against Americans are.inciuded in other

~ parts of this paper. Among them are his early.statements on the
approach to code clerk James STORSSERG (Part V.E.3.c.), his 1962
account of the arrest and attempt to recruit CIA officer Russel}
LANGELLE (Part Vi.D.7.a.), and his early reports on the attempt to
reCPUIE-CIA officer Edward Ellis SMITA (Part VI.D.2.). In all
three cases NOSENKO subsequently denied having played the role he
originally attributed to himself and denied having had personal
contact with the Americans involved. NOSENKO has also altered his
original accounts to say that he received no awards or decoration
for operational activity and that he had not received the promo-
tions he claimed. .

b. Details

The statements of NOSENKO given below concern primarily his .:
personal relationship with GRIBANOV and how GRIBANOV assisted
his rapid rise within the organization of the Second Chief Direc~.
torate. : i

12 June 1962: "Oleg Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV is a great guy. ‘

A real pal. We, so to Say, used to meet one ancther illegally

and had women together... GRIBANOV wrote a fitness report on

me. It was the very best that can be given, brilliant. GRIBANOV
. Wrote the very best fitness report on me. He had an excellent
: regard for me, excellent... I am supposed to become Deputy Chief
of [the Tourist] Department. I believe that GRIBANOV is promot-
ing young pecple, new people, who already have experience, good
experience, who have made recruitments. I know two or. three -{fof : B
the people he is moving ahead]. I personally have about 12 re- on . a
cruitments, four-or five of them were British and the rest Ameri- 2}
cans. He [GRIBANOV] has his eye on me in particular, and the.
question: of my advancement is right. now under consideration... I
will be Deputy Chief of Department. You must give thought to the

fact that Ihave been talking with you. You can ruin everything.

I have a career. I have bright prospects. vy boss GRIBANOV, ny
highest boss, has a very high degree of respect. for me. -He some~-
times bawls me out and I-- Well, I make it look Yike this is un-.
pleasant for me. But, in fact, it is a pleasant thing because, “
inside, I am glad he is bawling me out and not: someone else. I.
know that if he bawls me out he has a high regard for me. He -
sometimes calls me personally {to his: office] and says: ‘You
come with me. JI have to meet an ambassador.’ I go with him..

We arrive and have the conversation. He is there all night. He
comes out and says: ‘Well, where shall we go for a drink?’ I
know beforehand {that he will say this] and everything is ready
at the Aragvi Restaurant. We go there. ‘Well, what shall we
drink!' [GRIBANCY says). I answer: ‘Well, Oleg Mikhailovich,
cognac, of course! He is the highest chief. ‘I'don't drink
cognac. I'll ‘have vodka,' I say. ‘Well, we'll have vodka then,'
[GRILANOV says)..." One of NOSENKO's CIA handlers suggested at
this point that GRIBANOV seemed to treat NOSENKO as an older”

brother would. ‘NOSENXO replied: "That's his attituce toward me."

23 April 1964
Question: «Did you ever go to GRIBANOV's house?
NOSENKO: ‘I never went in the house. I have driven to it.
Question: Did he ever come to your house?
NOSENKO: No.

Question: Were you ever out at night with him, after work?
If so, how, under what circumstances?

NOSENKO: After work? Yes, once.

Question: Who else was there?

“NOSENKO: TARABRIN.

Question: What was the occasion?

NOSENKO: No specific reason. GRIBANOV called me at midnight.
I could hear that he was already drinking; he asked
me how long it would take me to get dressed and come

’ down to the Praga Restaurant, first private room..
Afterwards we wanted to go somewhere else to finish
the evening... GRIBANOV was sloppy drunk, lay down
to rest, he needed a couple of hours of sieep. I
drove him and TARABRIN home, got him there at 6:00
a.n., gave him some pills to help him: :

Question: When did you first personally meet GRIBANOV?

. NOSENKO: I might have seen him in 1953 or 1954, but I dia not

have a chance to speak to him then. once I was in two

group operational discussions (about 15 people present)
» about work against Military Attaches:.in 19545. - that was
the. first time I. ever. spoke to. him.. a so.

Question: when did you first have’ any personal conversation with

him?

NOSENKO: I don't remember.. He gathered groups of people.

Maybe I was with him with KOZLOV and others in Tourist
Department {i.e., between 1955 and 1960].

Question: When did you develop a personal relationship with him?

NOSENKO: It is difficult to say how it got- started. I was”

TT still working in the Seventh Department. It was in
1958, or maybe 1957. KOZLOV suddenly called me and
gaid I should immediately report to GRIBANOV. I did,
‘and GRIBANOV said.I should quickly be ready to go to
a reception with him at the Indian Embassy, with him
and Vera [Ivanovna] ANDREYEVA,

Question: Why you?

“NOSENKO: I don't know... (pause) Oh, yes, this is the story.

this is it, this is why he started favoring me. _
Earlier, some time in 1953, I knew some girls, Nina on
Pokrovskiy Boulevard and her girlfriend, Rina GUDKOVA,
friends of [Yu.I.)] GUK and [V.M.] KOVSHUK and [V.A.]
CHURANOV. CHURANOV was a friend of TARABRIN, who was

a friend of GRIBANOV. Through TARABRIN he got acquainted
with these girls, and TARABRIN brought them to GRIBANOV'S
dacha >ne night. The girls were talkative and: told me
all about it, and said they'd told CHURANOV. I told
CHURANOV who warned me not to mention it. I never did,
and GRIBANOV learned about this and liked it;.he re-
marked once: "You are not a gossiper..."

Question: How did he find out that you knew and didn't tell any~
one?

NOSENKO: 1 don't know, but he did,

Question: Who wrote your fitness reports?

NOSENKO: My last one was written by [V.D.] CHELNOKOV. The one
before that by (V.A.] KLYPIN, in the First Department.
Before that in the Seventh Department it was written
by [K.N.]} DUBAS, before nim by [V.A.] KOZLOV, then
[S.V.] PERFILYEV and before then, in the First Depart-
ment, by (A.M.] GORBATENKO. —

Question: Did GRIBANOV ever write a fitness report on you?

. NOSENKO: He may not have actually written them, but he signed

them, those reports written in connection with pro- -
motions to higher jobs or for trips abroad, or general
reviews of personnel. : wos .

15 February 1965 (from a protocol signed: 20 February 1965):
"Before I joined the KGB in 1953 I had never heard the name. of -
Oleg Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV. and knew nothing: about him. As. {F.G.)

|. SHUBNYAKOV, rather than GRIBANOV, was. the Deputy: Director of. the.

Second Chief Directorate responsible for supervising the acti- :
vities: of the: First’ Department. of the Directorate, where I: worked,.

it may have been several months after I began my.KG3 service ‘that |
GRIBANOV first came to my attention. I don’t know when I first’ . 2 oe
Saw GRIBANOV but it may have been approximately 1953 at.a meeting - . - i
before May Day or the 7? November holiday. . I’ would not “necessarily i
remember this as I frequently met much more important people, who - :
were friends of my father, and seeing GRIPBANOV wouldn't have been , : i
particularly important to me. Sometimes during 1954: and 1955, it H
was necessary to obtain the signature of a Deputy Chief of the :
Second Chief Directorate on a cable that. I had written and, if.
SHUBNYAKCY was absent at the time, I would take it to GRIBSANOV
for approval. Though I was only a junior case officer at the
time, I would take the cable, after it had been approved by the an
Chief of Section and the Chief of Department, directiy to GRISANOV, . :
who would simply sign it with no discussion. I do not renember how
many times I touok cables to GRIBANOV nor do I remember the contents
of any specific one of them. The first meeting with GRIBANOV that
I specifically remember was in the summer of 1956. I think it was
in June. I had returned from Kiev with KOZLOV and, after writing
a Spravka on BURGI, PERFILYFV, KOZLOV, and I went to see GRIBANOV.
‘KOZLOV didn't introduce we to GRIBANOV at that time, put CRIBANOV
knew that I was NOSENKO because the plan for the BURGI operation
said that I would participate and because PERPILYCV had made an °
appointment for the three of us to speak to GRIBANOV at this time.
The meeting lasted about 30 or 40 minutes. GRIBANOV read the re-
port on BURGI's recruitment and asked some questions. KOZLOV
answered some of these and I answered others. Other than asking
what Ukrainians took part in the Operation, I can recall none of
GRIBANOV's questions nor do I remember any of the conversation
which took place at this meeting. When we were through, KOZLOV
and I left while PERFILYEV remained with GRIBANOV.. Perhaps the
first time I was alone with GRIBANOV was in 1958 when I attended

a reception given by the Indian Embassy at the Sovetskaya Hotel

in Moscow. Usually [A.V.]} SUNTSOV accompanied GRIBANOV on such
‘occasions, butyhe was sick at the time. I don't know why SUNTSOV’ ~ :
usually went with GRIBANOV, why I was selected to go, or what I :
was supposed to do at the reception. I think GRIBANOV called the . :
Seventh Department and asked whom he could use, but I don't know : ,
why he picked ma. GRIBANOV told me that, at the reception, I was

to refer to him as Aleksey Mikhaylovich GORBUNOV. I was to

introduce myself as Yuriy Ivanovich and if anybody asked, would use

the last name NIKCLAYEV. Vera ANDREYEVA, who went with us, used ‘ ]
the name Vera Ivanov:a. After work, I went home to change ny :
clothes and we went 1n GRIBANOV's car from the KGB to the Hotel
Sovetskaya. GRIBANOV sat in front with the driver and I sat in
back with Vera ANDREYEVA. I cannot say how many times I have seen
GRIBANOV altogether. From 1959 on 1 saw him more frequently. foe
Sometimes, GRIBANOV would call meetings of chiefs of sections and

their deputies and I would take part in these. I had begun tc
eall GRIBANOV by his first name and patronymic in 1958, when I
was Deputy Chief of the First Section of the Seventh Department,
but at these meetings I called him ‘Comrade General.’ .In 1959:
_I also went to GRIBANOV's office alone in connection with tne.
FRIPPEL case and, sometime -between Nay and October 1959, -took
him a report that I had prepared concerning the use of tourist _
cover by foreign intelligence organizations." — - . : ,

had already spoken to CHELNCKOV,-who wWa3z then Chief of the Seventh

GRIBANOV and ask to be returned to the Seventh Departmert. GRIBANGY oo

finally agreed that I should return to tne Seventh Department as

position would be vacated by [8.A.] BALDIN, In July 1962 I was

to this position as scon as possible. I had no further personal
discussions with GRIPBANOV. about this appointment at this time. In
1963 CHELNOKOV [GRIBANOV's Depucy, F.D.] BOBKOV, and GRISANOV
decided that I should be named First Deputy: Chief of the Seventh”
Department. ‘hey cid not discuss this with me beforehand and no
order was igsued about this appointment. I was simply told that

- from that time I would be considered as First Deputy Chief of the

appoint me Deputy Chief of the First bepartment in late 1961, or

-for appointing me Section Chief and later Deputy Chief of the

Seventh Lepartment in 1962. He did not discuss with me my personal
qualifications for each of these positions. GRIBANOV had nothing
at all to do with my assignment to Geneva in 1962. I thins that
the kharakteristika written about me for this trip was signed by
BOBKOV, since he was tne beputy Chief of the Second Chief Direc-
torate who supervised the Seventh Department. I did not personally
discuss this trip with GRIBANOV before my departure from Moscow.

My candidacy for this assignment was supported sy BANNIKOV, the
Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the
work of the Eleventh Department which had the investigative file

on SHAKOV. BANNIKOV was concerned with the question of who would

go as case officer on this trip because SHAKOV, who was suspected

.O£ possibly being a Western agent, was to be in the delegation.

There was no background or neighborhood investigation conducted

on me in connection with my being approved for this trip. My
assignment was approved by the Eleventh Department, by the Person-
nel Office of the Second-Chief Directorate, by the Central Personnel
Office of the KGB and by the Central Committee of-the CPSU. GR{EBANOV
had absolutely nothing to do with my assignment to Geneva in 1964.
The kharakteristika on me for this trip was signed by BOBKOV. For
the 1967 trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of

.the CPSU was required for me or for any of the other members of

the delegation who had been approved for the 1962 trip. KKLOBU-

_ STOV, PANCHENKO, and KOVALENKO supported me for the assignment as

a personal favor to me. I did not discuss my. 1964 trip to Geneva
with GRIBANOV prior to my departure... In fact, I was even afraid
that GRISANOV would find out that I was going and would object to

my making this second trip.”

Question:

NOSENKO:

Teil me about: the” gecasions when you were with GRIBANOV
and TARABRIN.

Three times--drinking in cafes. Twice afterwards there
were girls. The most recent time was in September or
October 1963. I don't remember the first time.. In
1963 I received a call from. TARABRI' at home. - Then
GRIBANOV got on the phone and told me to take his car

‘and come join them at the Praga Restaurant. I didn't”

take his car because I didn't want tc call the duty-

. officer. 1 took a cab and went to the Fraga, They

were sitting there and drinking in a private room. I
joined them. They were drinking champagne, but I took
cognac. TARABRIN suggested girls about 1230 and GRIBANOV
made me go tc the office to get my notebook, I called
one girl I knew-~her and her sister. When I got back

to the restaurant it was closed with only GRIBANOV and
TAPARRIN still there, We went to the girls! (apartment).
They weren't prostitutes exactly. I knew her before.

Is this why GRIBANOV called you to the restaurart (i.e.,
to provide girls)?

I think so. It was the second time I had participated
in this. This last time GCRIBANOV told the girl his
name. The girl works in the Archives of the First Cnief
Directorate. At that time of night I wasn't able to
reach anyone else. Her name is Galina Mikhaylovna.

Her mother works in the Central Committee. I don't
remember her last name. GRIBANOV was drinking and she
told him that she had quarreled with ZAYTSEV, the Chief
of the First Chief Directorate Archives. GRIBANOV

. told her that he would give her a job and told me to

arrange for a job in the American Department of the
Second Chief Directorate for her. Galina's flat is in
the building inhabited by Central Committee workers on
Kutuzovskiy Prospekt. GRIBANOV's driver drove him.
home at 0600 and he was in the office by 0830.

3 March 1965: Speaking of the damage his disclosures must
have Caused the KGB, NOSENKO said: “I believe they will punish
people in the Second Chief Directorate [SCD]... Even GRIBANOV...

_ ihe ahead."

You said you think GRIBANOV, might be. fired. Yet, there”
ig nothing in the protocol you signed’ {see above] about
your relations with GRIBANOV which would ceem to make
him personally responsible for you. Is there something
else, something you haven't told me? . ,

No.

Why then do you think GRIBANOV would be fired?

(no answer)

(repeats)

Don't know.

Hell, what is your opinion at least?

Nothing, nothing. Let's not discuss this.

Why not?

It's simply my opinicn, that's all. I don't know why.
Well, what is your cpinion?

He was responsible for my becoming Deputy Chief of
Department.

But you had already gotten ahead before: you said he
didn't help you become Deputy Chief of Section in 1958.

Yes.
Did you ever hear any gossip about his help to you?

It was said in the SCD that he helped me become Chief
of Section and Deputy Chief of Department.

Why would BOBKOV be punished?

He was “my supervisor, and in ‘61 he was Secretary of
the KGB Party Organization.

would others in the Party Organization be punished?.

who talked to me.

‘Question: How about the First Chief Lirectorate and the Seventh
Directorate?

NOSENKO: No. I wasn't close to them, except GUX.
Question: How about First Chief Directorate resiéencies abroad?
NOSENKO: (S.I.] GAVRICHEV might ke recalled from Geneva.

Question: You must be withholding something about your relation-~
ship with GRIBANOV. -

NOSENKO: No, I was telling you I visited his office. He told
me: 'I found out you're drinking too much.' I said
no, not especially. He said: ‘Stop this ‘drinking
with KOVSHUK. It's not good for you.’

‘Question; But this couldn't harm GRIBANOV's Fesition now. . :

NOSENKO: They would review my file, and find that it contained

J the report about the woman in '54,* the fact that I
was turned down for assignment to Ethiopia, drinking,
scandals--GRIBANOV knew about this, but he approved
my appointment (to Deputy Chief of Department) anyway.

Question: Why did he promote you?

NOSENKO GRIBANOV thought I was a young, active guy. Six re-
cruitments--oh, they weren't much, but it sounds
great for the First Department, which was having no
success with Americans in the Embassy.

Question: But why make you Deputy Chief of Department?
NOSENKO: He thought I was a tough guy, good case officer. In
"59 I saw him often and was involved in a lot of

‘operations which were reported to him.

a Question: But it was not then, but in 1961, when he made you .
: Deputy Chief of Department. ‘

NOSENKO: (shrugs)

Question: Who would officially approve a Deputy Chief of Depart-
: ment? _ -

NOSENKO: Must be higher than a Department: Chief--bec. :se
: GRIBANOV-: signed. They could get him for his, especially
those who are against GRIBANOV.

1962, prior to NOSENKO's first contact with CIA, GOLITSYN was
shown HOSENKO's name among those of other Soviets in Geneva fo.
the Disarmament Conference. He faried to comment on it.

Ten major items from NOSENXO were discussed with GOLITSYN, all
pertaining to Second Chief Directorate: operations, and a list

of 15 names was shown him, rdentified as namcs of Second Chief
Directorate personnel whom the letter writer had named Among
these names was (fnu) NCSENKO, and GOLITSYN indicated he had

GOLITSYN had reported only on: one Aleksandr Fedoseyevich NOSENKO,. :
