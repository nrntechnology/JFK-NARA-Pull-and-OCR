I. STATUS REPORT ON TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH,
ee .

. The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27, AMICE/14, AMTRUNK/2,
‘and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March 1963 at Safesite #164
on Plantation Key. Andrew S, PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from
headquarters, was already at the training site when the team
was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS
and Hobart J. VANDEBORN. PARMERS remained at the safesite
until 16 March during which time he conducted training in
clandestine methods and techniques. This training included
security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-
tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and management,
and operational planning and reporting. The training included
group discussion and participation in a series of ‘appropriate
operational situations, several problems, and daily physical
training. During this two week period, either PEGGINS or
VANDEBORN visited the safesite every day, spending an average
of two or three hours with the group in operational dis- |
cussions and processing. During the week of 18 thru 23 March,
‘both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,
‘debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, workin
out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing
their training on an informal basis. The week of 25 through
30 March was spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass

-and map reading, including two night problems, and on weapons
familiarization and firing. During the period under dis-

” cussion the AMTRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED, were assessed
OO by the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series

' of immunizations, were issued clothing, were processed: for

_ alias documentation, were processed for disguises, and were
further processed on cover and finance problems. The re-
sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were sent to headquarters
under cover of UFGA-8111, on 13 March 1963, Based on DIR :
26430, no further LCFLUTTER is planned at the present time.

In late 1960 he sided With the counter=réevolutionaries and

COVER AND COM ZATIONS

A/2 will be issued documentation claiming he is an employee

of a local brewery in Havana. A/3 on the other hand will be
issued documentation as a. bus driver within the city of Havana.
Both will, also be isstied drivers licenses and additional

items such 4S immunization certificates, Cuban recéipts, etc.
The two men will also be outfitted with disguises.

“2. Communications
Primary communicatiéns will be eStablished through an SW
system. Both ifieén will be given SW instruction and will be
issued accommodation addresses in Miami, This instruction
atid these addressés in turn will be passed on to the recruited
assets in PBRUMEN for use as the operation develops. Pre-
arranged signals will also be dévised for usé by the team via
telegram.to indicate their progress and confirm their place
and timé of exfiltration. Both mémbérs will also be given an
OWVL system to provide them with quick instructions in case
of an emergency.

OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY _ EVALUATION

1. The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which
has considerable potential but also considérable risk. The
area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruisé missile
site and its accompanying radar. .In addition boat patrols are
kaown to work this portion of ‘the coast at frequent ititérvals.
“Once infiltrated the team will not have to travel far before
their first contact. However, A/3 is leary of staying at his
. for any length of time and hé does not want his
; to know of his présence in Cuba. For this reason the
‘farm will not be able to serve as a Safehouse, A/2 plans on
leaving the farm the same d _lands. This presents the

.On approach is to také A/3

to Guanabo or Havana and safehouse him. This, howéver, may
jeopardize the operation becausé A/3 lacks the maturity and
patience nécessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi-
ness. Hé may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under=
take a clandéStineé assignment on his own. When A/2 and 3
step ashore in Cuba; Control will vanish. Fortunately A/2

-haS a sufficient Yesource of judgement to g6 about his busi=

ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication.
For this reasot an attempt will be made to Steer A/3 towards
developing assets around his €@£ with maritime
recéption capabilities.

2. A/2, on the other hand, appears to have a sufficient -numbe
of ‘Supporting assets to provide for his safety while in Havana
However, hé has not seen @a } m for over a yéai. In
addition both men are presently outsi e of the Cuban Army

organization and this poSition may dampen their effectiveness

in recruiting within the Army. Station reports on QUA

‘flict with A/2's evaluation of this man. While there is no
evidence to verify that DUARTE is pro=-regime, there has been
a recent report 6n him from AMLEO/3 which claims 4 ‘is an
opportunist Who might work for the highest bidder caer Vik s
rebuttal to these refiatks is that @ REE has assisted him in

' the past’ and when the chips were down, he continued to aid him

in his underground activities. This still leaves a question
mark next to the worth of 4 DUARTED which unfortunately can only
be resolved by direct contact act between him and A/2. There are
other security implications which should be discussed in this
evaluation, Both A/2 and A/3 cannot bé considered truly se-
curity cofiscious. While safehotised A/2 wroté a letter to a
contact in Miami which was to be transmitted by his case
officer. The letter gave aii indication that A/2 was séeking
centacts in Havana arid convéyed the imprésSion that a trip
was in the a@fing. —A/2 has written several other letters

5 ‘K/2 on an opération that would take them
first to ae and then to Cuba. Once there they would go
is « mand begin to make contacts. A/3 also
stated that 2 a man named QUARTER would be one of their con=
tacts. This loosé talk Goupled with A/3's attitude that
KUBARK é6xists only to servé him makes him 4 marginal candi-=
daté for this opération. However , if A/3 is exfiltrated

“ithree-days after his entry into Cuba, the operation will
“. gain, his usefulness and eliminate somé of the risk he

presents.

3.)- The above evaluation stresses the operational and security
weaknesses in this operation. In contrast to these weaknesses
are the positive considerations of this mission. A/2 has the
intelligence, competence, and confidence to approach and re-
cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti-~regime
operations at a high level within the Cuban Army. The results
‘which these anti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter
for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential.
Nevertheless, if the operation continues, it will bear close
watching. in terms of security and control for these factors
will jeopardize the operation as well as KUBARK's position

if not properly contained.

His father, now deceased, was a prominent individual in law
and politics and was at one time a senator. A/27 himself
_graduated from law school in Habana and was a practising
lawyer. In 1959 he became legal adviser to Camilio Cienfuegos.
‘Following the disappearance of Cienfuegos in October 1959,
A/27 began to engage in counter-revolutionary activities,
In May 1961, at which time he'held the position of Under-
Secretary of Public Works, he felt that his underground
‘activities. had come. to the attention of the government and
he took refuge along with his wife in the Venezuelan Embassy.
He was given safe conduct from the Embassy to PBPRIME in late.
1961. Subject is intelligent, articulate, and highly moti-
vated. He has some experience in counter-revolutionary
‘activities and has demonstrated an excellent capacity for
learning clandestine techniques. He has a very large ego,
and aristocratic pride, is very sensitive, and is quick to
take offense CwiS thank to state that he h

and advice but will not accept KUBARK control. His attitude
although not hostile, is frequently critical, and he pre-
sents a difficult handling problem,
