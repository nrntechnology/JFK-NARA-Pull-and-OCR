which could prove to be a valuable lead.

DISPATCH SECRET UFAA~1845

d. During the middle and late 1950s, Roberto
had been @ salesman for tho Burroughs flour company
and had stayed clear of the poittical picture in Cuba.

e. During the sane period, Hector had been a.
gtudent in the University of Havana, under Raul ROA,
and had taken part in sone revolutionary activities.
He haa been arrested and beaten by the Batista police
for his anti-governzent actions and his father had
sent him into exile in tho US.

-¥¢,. When Castro came into pover, the father was
a potential “var criminal" for hig illicit dealings,
AMMUG-1, who was in the police force in the initial
stages of the revolution, states that he deleted an .
incriminating page from the father's dossier (showing

+ he -paid off the police to run his bolita operation)

and thus saved him from prosecution.

; g. AMHUG-1 continued to be close to the family,
especially with Roberto, ‘shom I say every day and
ran around vith.” Roberto never entertained the
revolution. As late as 1962-63, "We used to talk
quite openly and frankly. He was alvays against the
revolution and the communists. lle worked in the rc
Ministry of Industry because his brother got him the
job, but he had only one idea in his head: to get out
of Cuba and come to the US. He vas even plotting to
get out by boat. He had a US visa for many years and
had visited here many times."

h. When AlBwG-1 defected, he lost contact with |
Roberto, But, about two weeks ago a neighbor from
Regla came to Miami on the Freedom Flights. (COMMENT:
This undoubtedly refers to Cuban refugee Segundo
CASCUDO Gonzalez. Reference forwarded the ANMOT
debriefing of CASCUDO on Roberto.) When ANMUG-1
asked about Roberto, the neighbor said that he under=
stood that Roberto, “was assigned in a foreign
Bubassy." The refugee could not say what country
Roberto was in.

i. This news prompts AMMUG-1 to comment: "This
would be a most interesting person to talk to. Tf
don't think that he has changed his original way of
thinking. I believe he took the job to get out of
Cuba, and because of the-influence of his brother
Hector, I know he will talk to me and there is no
telling what this man is capable of doing if someone

approached hin.”
j- Roberto is (or was) marrted to:

Zulema (inu)
DPOB: c. 1934 in Cuba

They had two children and the wife was even
more anti-Castro than Roberto.

k. Hector, the other brother, was 2 rabid revolutionary _

when AMMUG@-1 last saw him inc. 63-G4. He had joined

the Castro bandwagon at the outset due to his revolutionary
activities during the Batista era and his closeness to

Raul ROA, Inc. 1960-61-62, Hector wes closely aligned

SUBJECT 3: Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera

1. This memorandum contains a recommendation in
paragraph three for the approval of the DDCI.

2. Vindimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera is a former Cuban national
who defected to the United States in Nova Scotia, Canada on
21 April 1964. At that time he was an intelligenee officer '
in the General Directorate of Intelligence, the Cuban external
intelligence agency. He was brought to the United States
under the provision of Section 7 of Public Law 110 (CIA Act
of 1949). He has never heen a member of the Communist Party,
but due to his service in the Cuban external intelligence
organization he is not eligible to petition tor naturalization
until ten years after the date of his defection, or 1974.

3. Mr. RODRIGUEZ desires to become a naturalized U.S.
citizen at the earliest possible time and has requested
assistance from this Agency. We request that a private bill

“be submitted to Congress waiving the ten-year provision of

the Immigration and Naturalization Act in his case, enabling
him to become a U.S. citizen after five years of residence.
[It is recommended that you authorize the Legislative Counsel
to seck a private bill for RODRIGUEZ' relief.

of Intelligence, he found he could no longer submit to having
‘his thoughts and actions circumscribed by controls which
deprived him of liberty and self respect nor continue to
-support the Cuban Government or be a part of its intelligence
activities; he therefore planned to defect as soon as the
opportunity arose, Aiter deciding to leave Cuba permanently,
he began a systematic collection of documents at the General
Directorate of Intelligence Headquarters, He brought these
documents with him to the United States as proof of Fidel
CASTRO's subversive activities in Latin America,

DETAILED JUSTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT
Ee EU DRDO MENE

1. Vladimir RODRIGUEZ LaHera has cooperated with this
Agency since his defection on 21 April 1964 at which time he
turned over to CIA documents from the General Directorate of
Tatelligence he had collected during the preceeding several
months. In addition, he has provided voluminous, accurate
and valuable information on the organization of the Cuban
‘intelligence services, their operations, staff members and
agents. These documents and information have given us the
potential and opportunity to take effective measures to
sateguard United States Government interests. Subject has
been of great value in the past, and will continue to be in
the tuture, in the CIA recruitment/detection program, His
wide acquaintance among and knowledge conceruiing high level
Cuban diplomats and Cuban intelligence personnel provides
the Agency with the necessary background in planning operations
against them and makes Subject ideal tor use in carvying out
the operations. His talents and contacts can be used not only
in turthering the defector program, but in other types of
political action and psychological warfare opcrations.

2. As a result of technical interrogations of RODRIGUEZ
on Ll May 1964 and again on 15 July 1966, his hona tides have
been established not only for intelligence exploitation .
purposes but also tor the purpose of resettlement in the .
United States, There is no reason to believe that RODRIGUEZ
is under the control of any hostile intelligence service,

3. The medical and psychiatric examinations have shown
that RODRIGUEZ has no serious medical or psychiatric problems.

4. Mr. RODRIGUEZ has adjusted well to American life,
He has been trained as a dental technician and has recently
appiied for employment with an airline company. It is
believed that he would be a solid, responsible citizen,

and thet AMMUG-1 had left her. AMNIP-1 called AMMUG-1's

place of employment in Miami on the day after Christmas and
