From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division,
Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with
various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the .
Agency's Audio-C “termezsures Program.z4{They conceived and developed ©
a unique techr’, 4n (fluoroscopic scanning\which is considered to be
a major breakthruugh i the detection of clandestine microphones and
other devices targeted against the Agency. It gives the Agency for 24
the first time the capability tofdetect hidden technical listening de-
vice a capability for which thée’intelligence community has expended
large” sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches. This tech--
nique will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations:
at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies
in the community. This technique was met with wide acclaim by the
intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures
Committee. >u

In experimenting with thellx-ray in combination with a fluoroscopic
screen,\these men showed this combination had distinct advantages in
terms time and effort over the considerably more expensive(i-ray 24
film and processor.) In further refinement of this technique, “they
designed an innovation in the form of’ a [fluoroscopic cloth) witch has

screens }) 24

To further enhance the use of this equipment, these
nen ceveloped an inconspicuous, easily transportable package,
consisting of two attache cases which hold th ~ray fluoro- 24.
scopich\equipment, wall racks, and motor units.~ This makes it
possibte for an audio-countermeasures team to enter offices,
residences, and safehouses without undue attention. |

These men have shown great ingenuity and resourcefulness
in the application and development of this audio-countermeasure.
technique. Through their further efforts in package design they
contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this
technigue-on a world-wide basis. This technique provides the
Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in-
terior wall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be
rapidly scanned in “real time" in the search for hostile tech-
nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance
the security of all Agency installations. .
