. Por fourteen days between 3 and 21 May 1965, the same CIA
psychologist interviewed NOSENKO on his entire early history,
from birth until about 1953, when he said he entered the KGb.
The main purposes were to collect additional information on this
period,* to gain further psychological insights into NOSEIKO's
personality, and to find possible ways of obtaining a truthful
account. Although conducted under the. physical conditions of
interrogation, the questioning was relaxed and followed no rigid
outline.: There were relatively few changes of story from pre-
vious versions; at the same time, however, NOSENKO described in
detail some incidents which he has subsequently admitted to be -
untrue. An extract from the psychologist's report of these
interrogations is given below.

Report by Psychiatrist

During the year April 1964-April 1965 NOSENKO was under the
medical care of a CIA psychiatrist who visited NOSE at regular
intervals, usually weexly, to examine him vhysically ard to listen
to any comments NOSENKO might have about himself and his situation.
The psychiatrist femiliarized himself with available materials on
NOSENKO, particularly with reports of his behavior in the months |
immediately following the dsfection. A report which he submitted

on 20 December 1964 is given below.

B. Views of Intelligence Personnel

1. Statement by DERYARIN

a. Introduction

Former KGB officer Peter Sergeyevich DERYABIN has followed
closely the entire course of CIA's investigation of NOSENKO and .
his information. He took part in the interrogations of NOSENKO '
in April 1964, January-February 1965, and Cctoker 1966 as an ob-
server and consultant, and he personally questioned NOSENKO during
July and August 1965 concerning certain aspects of his personal
past and early KGS career. On the basis of his direct, personal
knowledge of conditions within the Soviet Union and of KGB organi-
zation and procedures prior to his @efection in February 1954,
_-supplemented py continuing study of later information from a

variety of sources, DERYABIN is of the opinion that much of what
HOSENKO has said akout himself and the KGB is purposefully false
or distorted. Although DEXYABIN has been able to offer authorita-
_ tive comment on many aspects of NOSENKO's story, the following
‘section of this paper is limited to his remarks concerning HOSEN —
KO's entry into the KGB (then MUD) and-his Communist Party affili-
ation, both of which fall into the period when DERYABIN was active
as a KGB (then MVD) staff officer. DERYABIN personally interro-
gated NOSENKO on these topics in the summer of 1965. Since DER-
YABIN was a personnel officer of the KG3 (then MGB and MVD) in
Moscow, with long experience in Communist Party ectivities, at
the time NOSENKO claims to have entered the Anerican Department
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, he is particularly qualified
to comment on these aspects of NOSENKO's story.

DERYABIN, as a Soviet Army officer, #as gracuated in 1945
from the higher counterintelligence school of Snersh (counter-
intelligence with the Soviet Armed Forces). Following this he
@orked in Naval.Smersh in Moscow and in March 1947 began to work
in the MGB as a case officer in the Central Personnel Directorate.
Shortly afterwards, when his superior was appointed Deputy Cnief
of the Chief Guards Directorate for Personnel, DERYABIN trans-
ferred with him to the Guards Directorate. He served as a Guards
Directorate personnel officer until May 1952, rising through the
ranks from case officer to the position cf Chief of Section. One
of his responsibilities was the approval of personnel for service
in various units of the,Guards Directorate, and he was also in
charge of supervising personnel and security matters concerning
one of the Directorate's surveillance sub-sections.

} After requesting a change from personnel to operational
i duties, DERYABIN was transferred in May 1952 to the Austro-German
i : Department’ of the MGB Foreign Intelligence Directorate. Until
i December 1952 he served as the Deputy Chief of a sub-section in
i the Counterintelligence Sektor (desk) of the Austro-German Depart-
i ment. He was then appointed Deputy Chief of the intelligence
<3 _o. .Sektor of. the same department, a position he held until March
-"[953.. From March until September 1953, DERYABIN ‘was the Deputy ie
Chief of the section in MGB Headquarters which was responsible
for the security of Soviets stationed in. Austria and Germany.
In September 1953 he was transferred to Vienna, where he became
Deputy Chief of the section in the MVD Legal Residency respons-
ible for the security of Soviets in Austria. He defected to
American authorities on 15 February 1954.

DERYADIN joined the Komsomo) in 1936 wad remained a member
until 1940, when he became a candidate member of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union; he became a full Party memper in
August 1941. During his Party career he held a number of responsi-
ble posts. Before the war, when DERYABIN was a teacner in Altay
Kray, he #as the secretary of a local Komsomol unit and simultan-
eously served &s a member of the Komsomol Plenum in the rayon
where he lived. Prom October 1940 uncil November 1941 he was ;
Secretary of the Komsomol Committee of the 107th Engineer Battalion
of the Red Army and from June 1945 until April 1946 held the same
position in the Komsomol Committee of the Naval Smersh. This wes
the unit which had particular responsibility for counterintelli-
gence work within the Naval GRU, which NOSENKO said he joined in
1951. In the MGA DERYABIN wee a member of the Party ‘Committee of
the Personnel Section of the Guards Directorate and, after his
transfer, was elected Secretary of the Party Sireau of the Austro-
German Department of the Foreign Intelligence Directorate. He held
this post from January 1953 until his transfer to Austria in Sep-
tember 1953. .

bp. DERYABIN's Comments

Tne following statements by DERYABIN are based on his question-
ing of NOSENKO between 26 July and 13 August 1965. The questions
asked ang the statements attributed to NOSENKO (referred to as
Subject) #ere during this period. Although the Soviet State Secu-
rity Service did not become known as the KGB until March 1954,
this term is used for convenience sake, except where the specific
organization of the MGB or MVD is under discussion, DERYABIN's
comments follow:

“"NOSENKO's Acceptance into State Security*

- "Taking NOSENKO's. own statements at face value, it is highly
improbable that a person such as he has described himself to be
would be acceptable for a position as a staff officer in State
Security. The following factors are important in this regard: o

a. It was the policy of State Security to avoid hiring
the children cf high government officials.

b. Until STALIN's death in March 1953, KOBULOV, the
nan who supposedly helped NOSENKO gain éntrance into the
service, had no influence inside the MG3 apparatus. From
about 1948 until 9 or 10 March 1953, KOBULOV had no office
inside the MGB or the ‘VD buildings... I know personally that
in these years KOBULOV worked in Germany as Deputy Chief of
the GUSIMZ (Chief Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad) **
which was once directly under the Council of Ministers and
later under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The office was

c. It was physically impossible at the time for NCSENKO
to be recomended for and accepted into State Security, as he
has told us, all in one month, March 1953, (If one accepts
his earlier version that he had his talk with KOBULOV in Jan-
uary or February, his account is similarly impossible because
KOBULOV was not then in State Gecurity.) It would normally
have taken a much longer time, but in addition to this it was
a pericd of reorganization and the personnel staff was not
actively conducting their work at that time, and persanent
staff officers were rot sure that they would retain their
positions,

‘a. In March 1953. NOSEXKO was already twenty-five and a
half years old and only a member of the Komsomol. He had no
recommendation for Party membership. and could not become a
member for a full year because of his transfer from one ser-
vice (GRU) to another. It is impossible that State Security
would accept him knowing in advance that on his birthday re
would be twenty-six years old and without either Komsomol or
Party membership. ven for the son of a Minister, the Secre-
tary of the Xomsomol Committee of the KG3 would have to talk
with the Personnel Cffice and would not give a recommendation
for his acceptance, especially for the Internal Counterintel-
ligence (Second “hief) Directorate. In the case of a son of
8 Minister and one sho is recommended by KOBULOV, the secre-
tary would request from NOSENKO a recommendation for Party
membership from the members of the Communist Party where
NOSENKO used to work, in this case the GRU. In this way the
secretary of the Komsomol would be sure himself that NOSENKO

would become a candidate member of the Communist Party @uring
the next year. °

““However, even accepting that despite these obstacles and

‘contradictions the KGB would have accepted him, one must also’

remember (according to NOSENKO's own statemenis) that NOSENKO's
file contained the foliowing negative points.* They are serious
factors and certain of them alone would be enough to cause the
rejection; the totality makes it difficult to believe that at a
time of crisis in the State Security organs anyone would take the
resporsibility of accepting him:

a. Subject was already married and divorced before entry
into State Security.

b. He had been married to General TELEGIN's daughter
and TELSGIN had been arrested by State Security and was in
jail the day that Subject entered State Security.

c. NOSENKO said that there was a file on NOSENKO's
father in which compromising material was collected on -
-. - Subject's family. NOSENKO agreed that one piece of infor-
- Mation that would-have-been in this file was the fact that
his maternal grandfather died ir a Soviet prison while under
sentence as a counter-revolutionary. a .

d. The social status background in the life of Subject's
mother was nobility.

e. The shooting incident in Leningrad during World
War II and his desertion froi the Naval School in Baku
would have played a very negative role in any consideration
of his acceptance into State Security.

f. Subject never completed high echool in the normal
fashion. aaa

g. Subject was a poor student at the Institute of Inter-
national Relations. :

h. It should be added that the KGB would definitely
know that NOSENKO. was involved in an automobile accident
in 1947 and was interrogated by the Militia (traffic court),
‘found guilty, and fined. This would definitely play a
negative role in NOSENKO's admission to the KGB,

4. NOSENKO would never be allowed to enter the KGB having
just recovered from tuberculosis.* In fact, there was a rule
at that time that no person who ever had tuberculosis (even
twenty years earlier) would ke permitted to work in the KGB.

“In addition, after acceptance, the fact that KOBULOV was a
personai friend of Subject's father, as he has told us, would
hav2 been noted in the file and would have piayed a negative role
in permitting Subject to continue to work in State Security after
KOBULOV's arrest in June 1953. .

“I asked Subject how he answered some of the questions in the
anketa (entry questionnaire), particularly the questions on his
former wife, her relatives, and on his mother's ancestry.** I
then asked Subject how it was, taking into account his mother's
aristocratic ancestry, the fact that her father died in jail, the
Trotskyite allegations against Subject's father, the fact that
Subject's former father-in-law (TELEGIN) was still in jail, and
the fact that Subject was present when TELEGIN's apartment was
searched--that he had been accepted into the KG5, particularly
in 1953 during the confusion and changes after the death of STALIN.
Subject admitted that the question was logical, and said that he
could only assume that the influence of KOBULOV and the important
and influential position of his own father outweighed these nega-
tive factors. He also cited his GRU experience in this connection.

“I then asked Subject how he had reported his second marriage
tc the KGB. He replied that before the marriage he had mentioned

—_———_—

* NOSENKO first mentioned having had tuberculosis during the June
1962 meetings, when he described it as a minor case but said he
was under out-patient treatment until 1958, He next mentioned
his illness in 1966, describing how he sometimes coughed up a

- “glass of blood" at a-time, Although DERYABIN"s “questioning ~ ~
covered this part of NOSEIKO's life in detail, there was no
mention of tuberculosis in July and August 1965. DERYABIN's

comment is based on the 1966 information but is included here
for purposes of context.

**The anketa and DERYABIN's questioning on this subject are dis-
cussed further below.

it briefly to GORBATENKO, and that he hea unofficially run & name
check on his prospective bride (which was ‘clean'), and that after
the marriage he had filled out another anketa in which he included
all the required data on his wife and ber relatives. After con-
siderable prompting, Subject said that he fad indicated thet she
and her parents had been in France, but that he had concealed the
fact that her grandmother had been in German-occupied territory
during the ear. (He admitted that the KGB would have learned this
in a routine check, however.) I then reviewed for Subject the
negative security factors mentioned ebove, adding the arrest of
KOBULOV, the fact that his new wife and her parents had been
abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in German-occupied
territory, the fact that Subject was now over-age for the Komsomol
but not yet a Party member or candidate, and the fact that Subject
received a 15-day sentence for misuse of cover documents and in-
curring venereal disease, and asked if ‘he didn't think that his
personnel file jad been reviewed in 1954, and if so, what grounds
there could have been for retaining him in the XGR. Subject said
that he thought that his file probably was reviewed but that

again the influence of his father had saved him. Subject added
that another important factor was propably his language qualifi-
cation and particularly his higher educatior. I pointed out to
Subject that if his second wife and her parents had been abroad

it was impossible that her name check could have been negative.

He admitted it was illogical, but insisted that this was SO.

“NOSENKO's_Knowleage of KGB, 1952-54

“Entry Date into KGB: NOSENKO was reminded that he had pre-
viously siven varying dates for his entry on duty in the KCB. He
replied that he did not remember the exact @ate, but he was sure
that it was in the middle of March 1953 - perhaps 13 or 15 March -
(15 March 1953 was a Sunday). He would give no explanation for
why he previously claimed to have entered the KGB in =: . ° -
1952.* In fact it would be very unusual for a KGB officer to
forget his exact entry-on-duty date to the very day because it
is used to compute length of service and must be entered on vari-
ous forms from time to time.

“Numerical Lesiqnation of the Intelligence and Counterintelli-
gence Directorates in 1953: Asked to describe what directorates
existed in tne MVD while BERLYA was Minister (March-June 1953).
NOSENKO named the First Chief Directorate (FCD) and the Second
Chief Directorate (SCD) which he said were the: intelligence and
counterintelligence directorates respectively. Asked if he were
sure, NOSENKO said he was positive, and that the only change that
took place was that later, under KRUGLOV, for. a few months only,
the FCD became the SeD, and vice versa. NOSENKO stuck to this
even when told he was wrong; he did not ‘say he did not know or
did not rememter. perhaps realizing that he could not claim not
to remember shat directorate he served in. (Actually, the change
in numerical designations was instituted by BERIYA right after
STALIN's death in March 1953 and persisted -until the KGB was
organized in March 1954. Thus, NOSENKO does not know what the
correct designation of his own directorate was at the time that
he allegedly entered on duty with Soviet State Security and for
the entire first year of his alleged service there.

“MVD Leadershi 1953-54: Asked to nane the chiefs cf the
directorates and separate departments of the MVD under BERIYA
and KRUGLOV, NOSFNKO named nine out of 28. He was unable to name
the Chief of the Intellicence Directorate, saying that he remem-
bered only SAKHAROVSKIY (PANYUSHKIN was chief untis 1955). Asked
to name KRUGLOV's deputies, NOSENKO named only ROMASHKOV ani
SEROV, and was ignorant of such prominent deputies es LUNFV
SHATALIN. Told that a Secretary of the Central Committee of
CPSU was one of KRUGLOV's deputies at this time (SHATALIN), Xo
ENKO flatly denied that this was possible.

wo
i

“Organization of KGS: NOSENKO did not know when the KGS was
organized (March 1954). He said that it was in early 1955 or
late 1954, Told thet he was a year off and asked to think it
over, NOSENKO insisted that he was right.

“Processing Procedures for Employment with KGB: NOSENKO's
story about how he was processed for employment with the XGB in
1953 is inconsistent with the procedures used at that time. He
does not know many of the things that he should know about en-
trance procedures; he is wrong about many of the things that he
claims to remember. The disparities are so creat that they can-
not be explained (as NOSENKO attempts to do) by the claim that
KOBULOV's recommendation resulted in a simplified entrance pro-
cedure for NOSEUKO.

"The most important document filled out by prospective em-
ployees of Soviet State Security is a detailed personal history
questionnaire, called in Russian Anketa spetsialnoco naznacheniya
sotrudnika KGB. This exhaustive questionnaire is 16 pages long,
and filling it out is an experience that one is not likely to
forget. A background investigation is run on the basis of this
questionnaire, which itself becomes a permanent and prominent
feature of the employee's personnel file. NOSENKO remembers
filling out a questionnaire, but does not know its designation.
He asserts that it was only 4-6 pages long. He asserts that he
filled it out at home, and submitted it in two copies shortly
before entering on duty. Actually, this questionnaire was re-
quired in ore copy only, and was never permitted to be taken
home since it was a classified document (even when not filled
in. * .

“NOSENKO insists that he did not have to take a medical exam-
ination prior to entering the KGB. This is not possible. Such
an examination was a routine and mandatory part of the processing.
I cannot think of any instance in which it would be waived.**

* DERYABIN's views are based on NOSENKO's statements in August
1965. In his original biographical statement (1962), NOSENKO
said that no anketa was required. He implied as much in his
most recent statement in April 1966, after being questioned
by DERYABIN. This statement is given in Part V.8. ton

“NOSENKO's description of the secrecy agreemen* that he
signed when entering on duty with the KGB is completely unlike
the agreement that was in use at that time for staff employees.
It may be significant that NOSENKO's description of tho secrecy
agreement he recalls signing resembles the secrecy agreements
that were taken from agents.

“NOSENKO insists that he did not fill cut any other forms,
questionnaires, or papers when entering the KGa. Actually, there
were a number of other routine forms that had to be filled out by
applicants and new employees.

“Location of ROZHENKO's Office: NOSENKO says that all his :
entry processing was handled by a personnel officer named ROZHEN- j
KO and his staff. He asserts that ROZHENKO's office, which NOS- .
ENKO visited several times in early 1953, was located on the 6th !
floor, 8th entry, Building No. 12, Dzerzhinskiy Street. In fact, :
neither ROZHENKO nor any officers or units of the Personnel De-
partment were located in the 8th entry. They were all (including
ROZHENKO) located on the 6th and 7th floors of the 7th entry of
Building No. 12.*

“Rank Pay: Asked about his salary when he first started to
work in the KGB, NCSENKO said ke got a basic salary of 1700 rubles
as a case officer, 500 rubles for his rank of lieutenant, plus
secrecy, languace, and longevity pay. He insisted that this was
correct, even «nen told that KGB officers were no longer being
paid for rank in March 1953, and said that although he remembered
that there was one year--1954--when they were not paid for rank,
he was sure that when he first entered on duty he received this
pay. Salary for rank wags taken away from State Security officers
in September 1952 ard was not restored until April 1954. .

"Promotion to Senior Lieutenant: In giving the chronology
of his promotion to various military ranks, NOSENKO claimed to
have been promoted to senior lieutenant in April 1953, shortly .

-. after joining the KGB, Told that this was impossible, and that
no one in the KGB was promoted at this time, NOSEXNKO replied that ut
he couldn't say about anyone else but he was sure that he had re-
ceived his promotion at that time. In fact, this is impossible:
ali promotions in the KGB were frozen from the time BERIYA took
over as minister (March 1953) until late 1953.

“visitor's Pass Procedures: In talking about his first visit

to. the KSB to process for employment, NOSENKO was unable to re-

call the procedures employed by the KGS Pass Office in issuing

visitor's passes. Specifically, he maintained that the name of

the interviewer was not indicated on the pass. In fact,. the

name of the interviewer did appear on the pass and the inter-

. viewer had full responsibility for ‘the visitor while he was on

i- KGB premises. While it is understandable that NOSENKO might
! have forgotten the details involved if he had only visited there ;

“a few times more than ten years ago, if he worked at KGB-Head- = - --- -
as a supervisor he would have frequent occasion to admit visitors,
_and thus should know visitor's pass procedures quite well.

——_———

@NOSENKO has since said that he spoke to no personnel officers
prior to acceptance by the KGB or afterwares, thereky indicatiag
that his statements to DERYABIN were untrue. See Part V.8.

"unescorted Entry into KGB Building with Visitor's Pass: In

describing his first day at work, NOSENKO said that ne went from
the Pass Office, where he optained a visitor's pass, to the 4th
entry of the Building No. z, where his pass was checked by the
guards, and then went unescorted to KCBULOV's office on the third
floor. Challenged on this point, he said he wis sure that it was
possible to enter without an escort. In fact, it was arsolutely
impossible to go through any entry of Building No. 2 without
escort if you did not have a properly stamped KGS (MvD) identity
document (see below).

"KGB Identity Document: NOSENKO was asked to describe the
KGB identity document that he received when he first entered the
KGB. He was then asked if there was anything unusual in connec-
tion with this document at that time. He replied thet he knew of
nothing unusual. He was then reminded that rc STALIN's death
and again after EERIYA's arrest 1t was necessuvy to have special
stamps placed in the identity documents to vatidate them. With-
out the right stamp it was impossibie to ente: the KGB building.
NOSENKO was ignorant of this and was unable to recall anything
about it despite a numter of hints and leading questions. Actu~
ally, during the period of upheaval following STALIN's death and
again after 3ERIYA's arrest, all KGB identity documents were tem-
porarily withdrawn in order to have special validation stamps
placed in them, and it was literally impossiple to get in the
KGB buildings if one did not have the right stamp. This was the
subject of numerous anecdotes at the time and is hard to believe
that an officer who served in the KG3 at the time could have for~
gotten it completely.

"Gastronom: Asked to describe the sign in front of the KGB
Club, NOSEXKD said that he did not remember any sign (there was
one in 1952) but mentioned that there was a Gastronom (food store)
next to the KGB Club. Asked when the Gastroncm was cpened, he
said. firmly that it was already there when he started to work

“in the KGS. In fact, this Gastronom was definitely not there as

of 1954. It was opened sometime Letween 1955 and 1957, as Moscow
directories show. The KGB Club is in entry No. 1 of Building
No. 12, Dzerzhinskiy Square, and sOSENKO would have had to pass
it every day he went to work.

“Chief Directorate of Militia: Asked where the Chief Direc-
torate of Militia of the USSR was located in 1953-54, NOSENKO

replied that he did not know, and knew only that later it was
lecated on Ulitsa Ogareva. Actually, in 1953-54 it was located
next to the main KGS building at Dzerzhinskiy No. 2. A staff
officer in the counterintelligence directorate would have fre-
quent occasion to deal with the Chief Directorate of Militia.

"K.I. (Committee of Information): Asked where the Intelli-
gence Directorate of the MVD was located in 1953, NCSENKO replied
that it was scattered between Dzerzhinskiy Ko. 2, the Acricultural
Exhibition, the K.I. building, and Kiselniy Pereulok. This is

@ confused and incorrect enswer. “Asked for clarification, NCS="— ~

ENKO said that he had never visited either the K.I. or the First
Chief Directorate building at the Agricultural Exhibition. Thus,
NOSENKO seems to be unaware that the K.I. has not existed since

“"NOSENKO's Claim to Have Been a Komsomol’ Secretary in the
Second Chief Directorate, KGs

. "NOSENKO claimed to have become a member of the Komsomol
Organization (K/O) of the KGB when he entered on duty in March
1953, to have been elected as Secretary of Komsomol Organization
of the Second Chief Directorate in the fall of 1953, and to have
served in that capacity until the fall of 1954, when he was re-
moved because he used operational—alias documents in obtaining
treatment for a venereal disease he had incurred. He claims to
have been excluded from the Komsomol, without prejudice, when he
attained his 27th birthday in Cctober 1954.

“Asked to describe how he transferred from the Ke:somol Crgan-
ization of the Naval Intelligence Post in the Baltic to the Kom-
somol Organization of the KGB, NOSENKO gave an entirely incorrect
description of this procedure, both as reyards deregistration from
the K/O in the Baltic, and registration with the K/O in the KGB,
He stated that he was issued a new Komsomol registration card by
the KGB K/O, without reference to the previous K/O in the Baltic;
this is impossible. .

"NOSENKO gave an incorrect account of how a K/O secretary is
elected, stating that he was elected at a meeting of the K/O. In
fact, the K/O meeting can only select the K/O committee, which will
convene separately to elect the Secretary.

“NOSENKO could not describe the duties of a K/O secretary in a
specific manrer.

"NOSENKO did not know who was the secretary of the overall KGB
K/O. The secretary of the SCD K/O would be directly subordinate

_ to him and would deal with him frequently.

"NOSENKO was unable to describe his dealings with the KGB K/O
or the identities or responsibilities of the people with whom he
dealt there. :

“NOSENKO insisted that in 1953-54, the maximum age for a Kom-
somol member was 27. In actual fact, the maximum age was 26 (it
was raised later). This point is important, both because NOSENKO
should know exactly if he had served as a K/O secretary, and also
because it refutes his story that he was excluded from the Kom-
somol for over-age in 1954. ,

“NOSENKC maintained that all the members of his K/O paid dues
in the amount of 2 percent of their monthly salaries. This is
incorrect, as monthly Komsomol dues were calculated on a sliding
scale determined by wage group: at that time, Komsomol members
earning up to 500 rubles monthly paid 0.5 percent; those earning
500 to 1500 rubles paid 1 percent, and those earning over 1500
rubles paid 1.5 percent. The K/O secretary collects the dues, ~~

“NOSENKO did not know whether or not a Komsomol Congress
place every year. In actual fact, the 12th Komsomol Congress
which convened in March 1954 was the first since 1948; at this
12th Congress a number of changes were made in the Komsomol Rules
(Ustay). As secretary of a K/O NOSENKO would have been involved

in a good deal of preparatory work for this Congress, which was
&@ big event in the life of every Komsomol worker at the time, and
could not be forgotten," :

Although DERYABIN's direct knowledge of the KGB ended in 1954,
his detailed information of KGB procedures has been updated by. :
his_more recent examination of reports from ather sources. Wit :
regard to what NOSENKO has said about KGS procedures, DERYABIN
stated: “Asked to describe how he conducted name checks on a
Soviet citizen and on a new arrival to the American Embassy in
1953-54, NOSEXKO gave a superficial descripticn of how such
checks were done, However, he resisted every attempt to get him
to describe this process in detail, and he mace several blunders
which show that he never actually ran such a check himself. For
example, he did not know wnere the records of all Soviet citizens
who have been tried are kept, and he attempted to improvise an
answer (completely wrong) that they would check with the Militia
about this. NOSENKO correctly said that Archives were located
on Kirov Street, but he was completely unabie to stretch his
limited knowledge to provide a description of now these various
repositories were actually checked. NOSENKO was also asked to
describe in detail how he ran such a check on a Soviet citizen
in the 1956-59 period. Here again he was in difficulty and re-
fused even to try. He did not even know the everyday term Spets-
proverka, which means a check for clearance,

"It was particularly interesting that he did not feel able to
dispute my challenges of his information, even though he undoubt-
edly knows that I do not have first-hand knowledge of procedures
in this period. I even tested this on one occasion by asking :
NOSENKO the difference between the lst Spets Otdel (Special '
Department - KGB cards and files) and the Operatisno-Uchetniy
Otdel (Operational Reports Department - the functional name for
the lst Special Department). He answered that the ist Special
Department holds the files on Soviet criminal cases woile the
Operational Reports Department is for political and «spionage
cases. It seems he invented this answer on the spot. In addi-
tion, it is wrong that political and security cards are separate
from criminal ecnes in the lst Special Department. They were
in my time and must still be compined in one card file.

“NOSENKO states that he’ knows nothing about the files of
the First Chief Directorate. It is unkelievable that in ten
years of service in the Second Chief Directorate NOSENKO never
faw a First Chief Directorate file: how else would he be able
to check information on foreigners, especially on American Em-
bassy personnel? The first stage in such a check is an inquiry
to the First Chief Directorate and a check of aay files they
may have on the subject. According to his own account, NOSENKO
should have keen doing this type of thing the whole of- his ten
years of service, without regard to whether he was assigned to a
i _ the” American Department or the Tourist Department."

2. Remazks by CIA Handlers

a

a. Introduction
Five CIA case officers who worked directly with NOSENKO have
recorded their personal observaticns on his behavior and actions.
The principal case officer, the first CIA representative to meet
NOSENKO in 1962, participated in all of the meetings and inter- :
rogations (either personally or monitoring from off-stage) since ;
then; he is a senior officer with 17 years of operational experi-
ence, including extensive agent handling and dealings with more
than 10 officers of Soviet and Satellite Intelligence and Security
Services who were defectors or agents in place; he has also had
desk or supervisory responsibilities connected with at least 20
other such sources. A second case officer, who participated in
the meetings in Geneva in 1964 and in all subsequent phases of
the operation, has spent the 16 years of his career solely in i
Soviet operations and has handled several Soviet sources in place,
as well as defectors. Three other officers, who began to work
with NOSENKO after his arrival in the United States and conducted
the bulk of both the debriefing and the hostile interrogations,
have spent most of their careers in Soviet counterintelligence
operations; mong them, they command an extensive knowledge of
the Soviet Intelligence Services, and they have had a variety
of agent- and defector~handling experience.

NOSENKO was talked to and questioned in several types of
circumstances:

. _- In five tightly orgenized meetings in 1962 in
; Geneva with limited time available for each of a wide
: range of topics, none of which could be ignored but none :
of which could be covered in detail. : :

- In cgncentrated, but somewhat longer meetings in
place in Geneva in January-February 1964, with the know-
: ledge by all participants that items not adequately covered
i then covld'be dealt with after the defection.

- In routine debriefing sessions after his defection,
first in a'‘Frankfurt safehouse, then in a safehouse in
the Washington area, where a spectal effort was made not
to put pressure on NOSENKO or express doubts about his
statements.

: - Under detailed hostile interrogation (especially
April 1964 and January-March 1965). : : '

- In extended, detailed debriefing sessions which ,
NOSENKO could not evade (May-November 1964, May 1965,
July-August 1965, and October 1966). :

Thus there were opportunities to note his per formance and_reac-. ~ oe
~ -"'¢fions.under varied degrees of stress and control.

- The features of NOSENKQ's conduct, manner, and. techniques
discussed below are confined to those which were clearly and con-
sistently observed by all of the officers involved.

b. NOSENKO's Conduct in Meetings

NOSENKO in brief, superficial, uncritical debriefings (of
the sort which characterized the 1962 and 1964 Geneva meetings
and the debriefings.prior to 4 April 1964) was reasonabiy con-
vincing in his manner. For example, on the basis of the hur-
ried sessions of June 1962 in Geneva, which did not allow time
for systematic or detailed questioning, the CIA case officer
in commenting on NOSENKO's conduct mentioned "the ease of his
manner, the sureness of his knowledge of matters which he should
have known, and the amount of checkable information he provided.”
NOSENKO seemed to that case officer to be “ynder little or no
restraint as to the amount and nature of what he told us® and
“made a convincing and good personal impression: a vigcrous,
temperamental and vital man.” Similarly, nothing in NOSENKO'S
manner caused doubts on the part of the Fal representatives who
took HOSENKO's reports in February, March, and early April 1964.

It beceme apparent, howsver, when the cases NOSENKO had
mentioned briefly in early meetings were taken up in detail in
leisurely debriefings after the defection, that he could not add
facts consistent with what he had said before. He was unable to
recall related incidents or additional Circumstances which did
not come to mind in the first telling, despite being aided by
Guestioning from different angles or in different coatexts. The
sae results were obtained in exhausting his store of operational
leads (with a half dozen exceptions) and his information on XGB
procedures, installations, and operational methods: Having once
reported on these general topics, NOSENXO could offer nothing
more when debvriefed again, regardless of the method of question-
ing tried. Repeatedly he used the same stories to illustrate
his points; new stories did not emerge. In a perica of nine
months, NOSENKO was drained of information "6h nis p2Ysoma: and

professional experiences and knowlédge., Never before hag the
CIA _ case officers encountered a.defector who was totally de-
briefed. ; ER ee cere

A technique NOSENKO has frequently used to explain his in-
ability to supply details and to forestall further questicning
Mhas been to claim poor memory. “Different people have cifferent
BF types of memories,” he has said on many OECasiIONS; OF ON Others?

"T have tore what I remember." The case officers who have
handled NOSENKO agree, on the other hand, that he has an excel-
lent memory, although perhaps a peculiar one: NOSENKO did not
always recall most easily those events which had occurred most
recently, or those incidents which were most closely related to
him. He was able, for example, to remember detailed information
on the penetration of the Courier Transzer Station in Paris and
to give a long, detailed, and ordered account of she compromise
of PENKOVSKIY, in neither of which he claimed any personal role;
he has been able to name hundreds of KGB officers, to give the
dates on which many of them transferred from one component of
the Second Chief Directorate to another, and to describe their
responsibilities at particular times. Yet NOSENKO forgot where
he himself served in the GRU; he could not consistently dis-
cribe the circumstances of his divorce; he failed to provide a
consistent date for his entry into the KGB and for his transfer
from the American Department to the Tourist Department in 1962.
Likewise, NOSENKO remembered details of KGB operations which,
like the "ANDREY” case in 1953, took place in the relatively dis-
tant past, but he could not recall the travels, friends, and
activities of his own target,cohn Vv. ABIDsAN or details of opera-
tions against many American code clerks in 1960 and 1961. —

These limitations of krowiedge ar.2 quirks of memory were
evident rot only during meetings when NOSENKO wes being desriefed.
They were also apparent in the interrogations which supplanted
the debriefings.

Ce NOSENKO's Behavior Under Interrocation

(i) Introduction

In the many and long interrogation sessions there emerged
habits of behavior noticeable t> each of the CIA officers present.
Trese characteristics of NOSENKO were his manner of recounting
events and his evasiveness, improvisetions, ard other defensive
techniques. They are reviewed beiow.

(ii) Manner of Recounting Events -

Typical of NOSENKO's performance in the interrogations were
the following points:

- Talking about operations he supe:vised and about his per-
sonal role in the KGB Headquarters aspects of other operations,
NOSENKC habitually used the passive voice ("it was decided") or
indicated that he was not alone in these activities (“there was
no atcounting on who was working on any code clierx case--it wes
GRYAZNOV, <XOSCLAPOY, NCSENKO, and also working was KLYPIN, GRIBAN-
OV," or “We made the decision--1 and KOVSHUK and GRYAZNOV," or "I
and GRYAZNOV discussed this with him.*) hen asked where a par-
ticular conversation took plate, he rarely located it in his own
office (“I was in KOVSHUK's office when, KCSLCVY called him about
the trip" or "I was 1n KLYPIN's office and he was talking to
KOVSHUK") . .

- At the other extreme from being impersonal, NOSENKO some-
times quoted conversations in which he took part (“I then said,"
“he said to me," etc.), but it was in just such matters that
NOSENKO most often contradicted himself (e.g.. his relationship
with GRIBANOV ard his part in the recruitment approach to the
American Code clerk James STORSBERG).

- In repeating certain ‘stories (the CHEREPANCV case and the
provocation against Professor Frederick BARGHOCFN are examples)
NOSENKO gave them in precisely the same order, without addition
or omission. -In relating the FENXOVSKIY story, which he stressed
he learne@ “little by little’ from several different sources, he

_ presented the facts each time in nearly identical order. Asked

for more details on these cases, he invariably insisted--often
with irritation--that ne knew nothing more and if he did, he
would have reported it. Other factors contributed to the im-
pression that in such instances NOSENKO hac delivered his infor-
mation by rote: Statements like “I don't remember what I told
you before” when queried agair on a particular case; detachment

and a lack of emotion when describing the compromise. of Soviets:

who, like himself, had cooperated with American Iatelligence:
POPOV, PENKOVSKIY, and CHEREPANOV: an inability to correlate
dates and events in different operations which he said he was
handling (such as conflicts in the timing of his approach to
W.E. JOPNSON and in the date he gave for John V. ABIDIAN's visit
to the Pushkin Street dead drop, and conflict between the dates
of his participation in the MORONE case and his travel to Cuba).

oa = NOSENKO, with a few excupticns (notably the compromise of
PENKOVSKIY and the ASTDIAN visit. to the dead drop site), could

not supply specific or approximate dates for operational activi-
ties during the period of his service in the U.S. Embassy Section.
Beyond recourse to the phrase "1960, 1961," he refused to estimate
the dates or to associate these activities with the time of the
year or events in his personal life.

(4ii) Evasion, Improvisation, and Other Defenses

In the debriefings before the interrogations, MOSENKO avoided
questicns and topics not of his own choosing, saying that he would
give full details “later,” when systematic debriefing began.
When the question or topic came up anew in a later debriefing,
re would plead fatigue or boredom and propose: “This morning
we drink; tomorrow we work." Prior to 4 April 1964 he provided
only accounts of operations selected by himself; it was only
after 4 April 1964 that he could be, constrained to reply to de-
tailed questioning on other matters. -

Prom that point on, other evasive tactics became familiar
to his interrogators. He would try to change the subject or
to shift from the specific event to a generalized account ef how
such things were done in principle. He would claim bad memory
on grounds that, for example, operations against U.S. Embassy
personnel were hopeless and useless anyway. lie would dismiss the
details or the entire operation as unimportant (for example, the
microphones in the U.S. Embassy). He would set out reasons for
his ignorance of things he admittedly should have known (his own
“poor performance,” preoccupation with other matters, inattention
to duty, absence from the KGB while on vacation, lack of time to
master details because he was a superviscr). Unable to name or
talk about KGB indigenous agents working against Americans, in-
cluding those in operations under his supervision, NOSENKO
disparaged the quality of, such agents ("they never reported any-
thing of interest on anyone"); he cited their low educational
level and their inferior status as servants and employees as
one reason none of them could give the KGS operationally useful
information. In fact, the record of many indicated previous em-
ployment which would demand at least the equivalent of a college
degree or certificate from a technical institute. Numerous maids
were former school teachers, one was formerly a chemist.

When evasion failed, it seemed to the interrogators that
NOSENXO improvised his answers. Some of these evident improvisa-
tions led him into unacceptable statements or positions. To use
his responses to the questioning on Jchn V. ABIDIAN as an example:
Not knowing about ABIDIAN's car, he said the KGB could not get
at it. (In fact, the car was held by Soviet customs for two
weeks, and later NOSENKO himself spoke about the way the KGB used
Embassy chauffeurs for access to cars.) Not knowing of ABIDIAN'S
trips out of the USSR, he claimed that the KGB had no way to
find out where Embassy officers went when they made trips out of
the country. ..(In fact, ABIDIAN had told his languege teacher ~—
each time and she, as NOSENKO said, was a KGB agent; also, ABIDIAN

arranged his trips by long-distance phone from Moscow to his des-

tination abroad, and the KGB can cover such calls.) Not knowing
of ABIDIAN's trip within the USSR, he spoke of a vacation which
he latter admitted to be false. Asked why he did not know personal

data on ABIDIAN from the State Departnent Bicagrap: Register,
he said “only the First Chicf Directorate” uses i when tne

interrogator pursued the point, NOSENKO gaid he romembered that
KOVSHUK did have a copy in his office, "but an oid one, 1956,
which didn't list ABIDIAN." Under pressure about ABIDIAN's visit
to Pushkin Street, NOSENKO said the ¥GB thought that ABIDIAN may
not have entered the building on Pushkin Street; yet he had earl-
der given extensive details about how the KG3 had analyzed the
precise number of seconds ABIDIAN had been inside, to‘determine
where the drop, if any, might be. As another example, when he
wag initially asked about Geosge BLAKE, tl.2 KGB agent in MI-6,
the context of the question was a discussion of Second Chief
Directorate operations. NOSENKO labeled it as such and said it
“was not as important as VASSALL." Later, when the name was men-
tioned again, he asked: "Who's BLAKE?"

On other occasions, when his self-contradictions were pointed
out or when he admitted ignorance of matters ha acknowledge he
should have known, NOSENKO would fall back upon cne of the follow-
ing lines of defense:

- "What I know XI tell you; what T remember I tell
you," or “I doen't know," "I can't explain," -- or a shrug.

- The details, even if confused or contradictory, are
not important. What is important is the “whole” or entirety
of the facts, their importance and their “reality.” It is
this that American Intelligence should evaluate, not de-
tails. ©

- He must be genuine because otherwise “how could I
have been working with 'SARDAR" and 'PROKHOR'?" (Johan
PREISFREUND whose KGB cryptonym was "PROKHOR,” did con-
firm NOSENKO's role.) “How eles could I’tell you about
My STORSBERG?" “The KGB would not use a staffer as a provo-
cateur," nor would the KGB supply information on "live
cases" such as the Paris case (JOHNSON) and VASSALL, and
reveal the names of its officers abroad.

- If American Intelligence checked his story "fully,"
it woulda learn that despite all this confusion, he was genu-
ine. He repeatedly urged that his interrogators check
via an independent pen creation of the KGB--there it would
verify that his name is registered as the case officer who
opened, held and turned over the ABIDIAN file and thus that
he was a KGB officer.* a

NOSENKO referred to this method of corrcborating him .at least
20 times during the interrogaticns of January~March 1965. He said
on 1 February 1965 that “maybe the day will come when you have
a source to check and you will find out" (that he was ABIDIAN's

case officer). Later in the same interrogation session, he added:.

*r see how poor and miserable I'm looking with regard to ABIDIAN's
file, but anyone who can check in [KGB] Archives will see." On

> February he said, "I greatly wish that you will have as- soon

as possible an agent in the KGB. It is simple to look at the

file on ABIDIAN. On the first page is written thet ‘I, NOSENKO,
Yuriy Ivanovich, opered this file'.* On 16 February he said: “Time
will show I am what I say." On 3 March he referred nine times with-
in one hour to a check via such a source. He repeatedly stated

that “time will show" that he is not a provocateur. At one point
he engaged in the following dialogue with his interrogators:

NOSENKO: I'm telling you that, if you check, you'll find
that I'm right.

INTEZRROGATOR: We're not disputing that you worked for the KGB.
We're disputing that you held the positicns you
say you held in the KGB.

NOSENKO: That's what I'm saying.  £ you cculd check you
would find thet I was only in these two departments
and only in these positions...

(later in the session)

NOSENKO: I can't tell you anything wore. I can't prove
anything. Maybe the future will shew.

INTERROGATOR: What can the future show?

NOSENKO: XY don't know. But from what I understand the check-
ing has not gone very far. Maybe you can check
further... I mean, if you have any possibility now,
I mean by chance, have anyone in the KGB or out of
the KGB, with any of my acquaintances, friends.

INTERROGATOR: You mean our acquaintances, don't you?

ROSENKO: Yes, but maybe your acquaintances can check with
someone, because anyone in the KGB should know
that, yes, there was a NOSENKO.

INTERROGATOR: Should we ask someone like VAKHRUSHEV or SUSLOV?

NOSENKO: — No, of course not, because I gave you their names.
Check someone else, not known to me, so you can be
sure.

a. Additional Observations

(i) Inquisitiveness About CIA

NOSENKO's questions about CIA and its activities seemed to his
interrogators to be beyond the interest or curiosity expected of

. Soviet Intelligence defectors. Frequently he asked, even while

discussing his own KGB responsibilities: "You tell me about a case,
and I will remember details." Other examples of NOSENKO's inquisi-

Lee ne ren

-tiveness--include--the- following: NS ee

= When shown the CIA publication "Checklist of Soviet
Officials Abroad" during the 1964 meetings in Geneva, NOSENKO
made inquiries about what organization prepared it and to what
part of the U.S. Government that organization is subordinate.

- In January 1964, entirely out of context, he asked :
whether GOLITSYM had reported to CIA that Finnish President t
KEKKCNEN was a KGB agent. (He was not able to explain in :
later questioning why he had not informed CIA about the case
before he made the foregoing inquiry.)

- NOSENKO asked precisely how American Intelligence col-
lection in the USSR is directed and coordinated. The CIA case
officer responded: “What was that question?” NOSENKO there-
upon said: “It was not a question--just general interest.”
When the case officer urged him to repeat the question, he re- '
fused to talk about it and diverted the conversation to other
matters.

- He asked where CIA secretaries resided in the Washing- :
ton area. , {

- NOSENKO tried to find out the grades of the CIA offi-
cers in contact with him.

cer who met him in Geneva two years earlier had received a
medal for that phase of the operation.

(ii) Acceptance of Contrary Information from Other Sources

Under interrogation, even when accused of lying, NOSENKO
rarely challenged the validity of CIA's information nor claimed
superior knowledge. The only facts he challenged strongly were
incontestably true, such as the date of GOLITSYN's defection, the
date of ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin Street dead drop, KOSO-
LAPOV's travel separate from JENNER, and KOSOLAPOV's November 1960
trip to Helsinki. It seemed at all times that he accepted that
CIA knew more than he did on tovics including conditions in the
USSR and cases and people for whom he claimed direct responsibility.
-He never challenged DERYABIN's statements abcut KGB procedures, :

(e) Discussions with NOSENKO on His Own Performance

: After admitting his inability to respond to questions about
i operations in which he said he participated, NOSENKO sometimes

: gave a general appraisal of his own performance. He would admit
: that it was “impossible to have such memory breaks" and agree

U that his response was neither reasonable nor acceptable ("In your
place I wouldn't believe it either," or on another occasion, "It
: will look bad to your boss"). Admitting that the questions were
fair, legical, and clearly put, he acknowledged at least a dozen
.times during the January-March 1965 interregation that his per-
formance under questioning was bad and unacceptable.

Cc. Polygraph Testing
“y. Test in April 1964

Shortly after his defection, NOSENKO agreed to undergo a
polygraph examination which tre CIA handlers hed told him was a
routine part of his defector processing. He was informed on
3 April 1964 that the test would be administered the following
morning, and that it was therefore advisable for him to get a
good night‘s rest and to refrain from alconolic beverages. Nos.
ENKO @rank heavily on the night of 3 April, did net enter his
bedroom until 0290 hours on 4 April, and following breakfast at
0739 nours on 4 April consumed several gin-and-torics. Subse-
quently, when NOSENKO thought he was noc being observed, he was
geen to remove his hand from his lips hurriedly.*.

ae

Pollowing a medical examination by a physician who noted ;
that NOSENKO had been drinking, ne was introduced to the CIA '
polygraph operator. An expe: senced interrogazor, fluent in the
Pussian language, this polygraph operator conducted the test in
Russian from 1045 to 1515 hours on 4 April. His report is quoted
below.

“The question of Subject's ({NOSENKO's) willingness to par-
ticipate in the polygraph test was one of minor consideration,
since he had, on previous occasions. agreed that he would take
the test. However, whether Subject wouid continze with the
polygraph testing if confronted with atcempted deception after
an initral test run, was one of the considered problems. Con-
sequently, in order to preclude the possibility of Subject's
terminating the test prior to its completion. 1t wes decided
that a minor deviation. from the accepted poiysreph technique
would be used during the polygraph testing: specifically, to
insure that a polygraphic recc:¢ of Subject's reactions to all
the pertinent questions be obtained prior to challenging him on
any significant polygraphic deception indications his charts
might reflect... This plan was followed throughout the poly-
graph interview...

ee
* On 16 May 1964 a report was received on the chemical analysis
of six types of tablets which had peen taken from NOSENKO's
personal effects. In this report, a CIA chemical expert made
the following remarks based on chemical, microscopic, and in-

“Although the Subject had used both alcohoi and some unknown
drug prior to testirg, there is nc question, based both on analysis
of Subject's polygraph charts as well as persor2l observation dur-
ing the interview, that Subject has attempted celiberate deception
in the specific pertinent areas which are mentioned below in this |
repe:t. |

*It is [my] conclusion that Subject is not a bona fide defector,
but is a dispatched agent sent by Soviet Inteliigence for a spe-
cific mission or missicns.

"According to the pian, the differert phases involving various
pertinent areas were covered with Subject polygraphically. Chal-
lenge of Subject's reacticns was indirect and ‘sort.' On no occa-
sion did Subject even attempt to volunteer any explanation of the
possible causes for his polygrach reactions. He continually denied
and refusec to admit that there was anything ts any of the questions
which were asked of him. when the final test questicns were com-
pleted and a record was cbtainedc of all of Subject's polygraphic
responses, the nature of tne challenge and probing was changed.

"Subject was told that he was lying to numerous pertinent ques-
tions and was accused of being a dispatched agent. Subject's only
explanation to [my] direct accusation was that ne could not be a
dispatched agent because of the amount of information he had volun~
teered to American Intelligence.

"Subject, who before and throughout testing reflected com-
plete self-control and ccmposure, mow exhibited a completely dif-
ferent picture. His composure was non-existent, his eyes watered,
and his hands tremtlei. Prior te being confronted with [my] opinion
thac Subject was a dispatched agent, when Subject was asked on
one of the last test runs (a) 1f he were sent to penetrate Ameri-
can Intelligence and (b) if Subject received instructions from KGB
on how to attempt to beat the polygraph, his answers were given
in a voice that actually trembled...

2. Test in October 1.965 on Lee Harvey OSWALD

a. Introduction

CIA conducted = ‘volygraph examination of NOSENKO on
18 October 1966 on *2c¢ suoject of Lee Harvey OSWALD. *

Since the previous polygraph test in April 1964, NOSENKO
had been under close security guard, his movenents restricted,
and tn the interin had been interrogated in detail and accused
of bad faith in dealing with U.S, Government authorities.
NOSESKO had not been interviewed by CIA during the six months
prior to October 1966. He had had no access to alcohol or
drugs, his food consumption had been normal, acd his sleep
had been adequate. .

NOSENKO was given no advance notice of the polygraph
examination. Upon entering the room where it was to take
place, he immediately recognized the officer present as the
person who administered the first CIA polygraph test two and
one-half years earlier. NOSENKO correctly said that they had
first met on 4 April 1964.

In the pre-test interview, questions on the OSWALD case
were put to NOSENKO in Russian, his answers (also in Russian)
were recorded, the operation of the machine was explained,
and clarifications of the questions ard his answers were
made. The three series of questions pertaining to the OSWALD
case are given below in their entirety, and they are followed
by the conclusions of the polygraph expert.

VIII. NOSENKO'S BONA PIDES: ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS

A Introduction

It is standard procedure to assess the bona fides of each
intelligence and counterintelligence source, and special care is
required in assessing sources of information relevant to the secu-
rity of the United States.

One difficulty in doing so with a Soviet source is that
Soviet realities, particularly in the KGB, are imperfectly known:
Except where independent informatie: is available, it is risky to
say ard impossible to prove what the Soviets--most notably the
KGB--would or would not do in any given situation, or what any
given KGB officer should or should not know. Independent informa-
tion, voluminous in quantity although never comprehensive and
entirely current. nevertheless has been assimilated from the re-
ports of tne several KGB staff officers who have defected, from
the KGB agents who have conzessed, and from the Western services
which have investigated KGB activities. There is, therefore, 4
base of reliable knowledge upon_whicn to predicate an assessment
of a source reporting on the KG3, even one who principally covers
a KGB component (in this instance the Second Cnief Directorate)
upen which there previously had been relatively little inside .
cnformation. Moreover, in the absence of direct evidence from
ether sources, it would be acbitarily confining if an assumption
dere not made that certain KGB standards are at least comparable
to these of Western services. Such prior knowledge and, to a
limited extent, such an assumption are factors in the assessment
of Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO thac is submitted here.

A much more prominent factor in this assessment, however,
is NOSENKO's own testimony. CIA has exhaustively debriefed and
interrogated NOSENKO, his leads were checked, his information wa3 a
studied, and a large body of facts pertinent to his bona fides ik
#as thus assembled. These details, as well as direct evidence :
from other sources and the views of specialists affiliated with
CIA, have been presented in Part ITi. through Part VII. of this
paper.
The basic questions with recard to the bona fides of
NOSENKO are the following:
- Is there reason to question the general accuracy
and completeness of NOSENKO's accounts of his situation ,
_and@ motivations in contactirg CIA and later defecting,
his personal life, military service, positions in the
KGB, personal participation in KGB operations, know—-
ledgeability about KGB activities and the way he learned :
of them, and his associations with KGB personnel?
- If there are grounds for doubting the general {

accuracy and completeness of these accounts, then what

nature of the information he has provided, and for
other Soviet sources having authenticated his personal

\ life and KGB career?

In assessing the bona fides of NOSENKO, the classic method

are the explanations for NOSENKO's actions, for the . |

has been used: evaluating his production and sourcing, examining

his autobiography, and appraising him and the circumstances of

this operation. These points, with the conclusions drawn from

each, are reviewed below. Tne Giscussion continues with a survey oo
of the sources who have corroboratec NOSENKO's background and an
status, and this is followed by argumentations on the various

hypotheses which could explain NOSENKO as a source. The final

portion is a summary of conclusions about NOSENKO's pona fides.

B. Evaluation of Production

1. Introduction

what a Soviet source repo

wa te

rts is one factor in assessing his : ah

can it be conclusive: Even a genuine

and con3cientious source may be poorly informe’ or misinformed; he

may be hampered by forcgetfulne

education; his reporting may be incomplete because he is not avail-
able long enough to permit amplification and clarification of his
information. On the other hand, a Soviet-controlled agent who is

planted on the opposition may
and accurate information.

There are several standar
ment of a source's production.
likely to be conclusive by its

First, how does the information equate, in terms of complete-

ness, accuracy, and detail, wi

ternal consistency of the source's reporting and also compares it
with information from other sources and fron investigations.)

Second, dces the informat

Me source may Simply not know any-
Also, information which seems harm-
ly be such in Soviet eyes; for ex-

ample, the loss of an apparently valuable agent could be mitigated

by the KGB's possession of better or comparable assets still un-

exposed.)

Third, is the informetion important or useful to us? (This
point may in some cases Le irrelevant, for information useful to

us may not harm the opposition, and the apparent usefulness of in-
formation may not balance against the time and effort required to

process and investigate it.)

These standa.ds have been applied in evaluating the production _
of NOSENKO on the topics discussed below.

NOSENKO's production is exclusively in the field of counter-

intelligence information. As

described in Part VI.A., he did not

have any useful positive intelligence. This does not necessarily
affect the question of his bona fides, however, for NCSENKO claims
to have been a KG3 internal counterintelligence officer. From a
comparative standpoint, not one of the previous KGB officers who
defected to Western services has pro*uced significant military,
economic, or scientific information on the USSR, and only a few

have supplied political intormation (usually concerned with the

personalities and relationships in the ruling group of the Commu-

nist Party). Therefore, nothing of positive intelligence conse-..—-—-—-——-—f

quence is expected of NOSENKO,
raised about his inability to

although some question might be
report on the leadership of the

Soviet regime in view of his father's position and NOSENKO's
continuing contacts with the leadership after his father's death.
The failure of NOSENKO to respond to questionnnaires along posi-
tive intelligence lines is not considered unusual.

NOSENKO's counterintellicence production includes all of hig
information on the Soviet intelligence ard security organs: . 3

- their structure, functions, methods, and procedures; : J
- their officers, and their agents of Soviet citizenship:

- their operational activities inside and outside the
ussr.

For the most part this portion of the paper (as in Part VIII.C.
through Part VIII.P.) follows a format in which the evidence is
summarized, the facts interpreted, and conclusions presented.

2. KSB Organization, Personalities, Methods

Ability to discuss the structure of his service in general -
and at least some of its components in particular is an absolutely
minimal requirement for anyone who claims to have beer erployed
within that service. At the same time, current infossation or the
organization of an intelligence service is of classic interest to
opposing intelligence and security services.. Organizational
changes are indicators of policy and planning trends in the ser-
vice; shert of a penetration of the service's leadership, such
changes are perhaps the most reliable reflection of changes in
operational emphasis and tactics.

Cn ee

Had NCSENKO'’s information en the organizatioa of the KGB
been novel in this sense, it would have peen of considerable
value, while the exposure of this iunformation--althougn perhaps
not a major loss to the Soviets--would nonetheless have been
against the KGB's best interests. NOSENKO's reperts on the
organization of the KGB in 1964 (Pages 352-358) agree with and
are a logical extension of that framework of KGB organization ‘
newly revealed py the 1961 sources, but this weighs reither for : .
nor against him as the source: in the absence of contradictory : +
information, he cannot be subject to criticism or to suspicion :
because his reports show ro redirection of the thrust of the
KGB. Purthnermore, NOSENKO's statements indicating that there’ -
have been no major changes in the years between the 1959 re- :
organization and 1964 are acgeptadie in the light of available
information from other sources. The information which NOSENKO
provided on the KGB's organization therefore neither supports
nor discredits his bona fides.

ROSENKO's information 0: some 1,090 Soviets connected with :
intelligence and security activities is en impressive echieve-
ment of memory. These identifications, however, must be evalu-
ated according to the damage inflicted upon the Soviets by his f
exposure of these personalities. In this respect, the discus- : :
sion must concern new identifications, for intelligence person-
alities previously exposed could not be damaged any further by ‘
a@ repetition of their compromise. This discussion mst be fur-
ther restricted to new identifications of staff personnel, be-
cause the entire Soviet population is available to the KGB for . -
occasional use as it sees fit, with the loyalty and discretion :
of the individual as the only limiting factors; to learn that a
Soviet employed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow is an agent re-
porting to the KGB is to learn nothing that has not already
been taken for granted, and besices, no action on such infor-
mation can be taken. Finally, the new identifications also

must be ameng persons who are identifiable and accessible, or the
informaticn is useless to Western services ar? 4s ro loss to the

t. Soviets, On this kesis, onty ¥GB First Chief L:rectcrate as well
as GRU identifications merit inclusion ir. this ~veluation, since
these are the officers who normally appear akroed and participate
in agent operations. Although KGS Second Chief Directorate per-
sornel have in the past transferred to the First Chief. Directorate,
this is rot a predictable evert and cannot be considered in dis-
cussion of current damage.

NOSEMKO identified 165 First Chief Directcrate personnel, but
only 349 could be located in CLA files (i.2., were identifiable by
name); the remaining 16 nanes from NOSENKO were valueless as they
were untraceable. Of the 149, there were 37 «ho were not known or
suspected as intelligence officers prior to the receipt of NOSENKO's 4
information. Of 37, there were “4 who e.ther resided ubroad at the : .

_time of RCSENKO's defection or vere cent enresd since that time.*

These personality identificazions hence do not serve as evidence
of NOSENKO's bona fides. At the sate time, his inability to do
further measurable farm to the KGB ir, this regacd cannot be held
against him, either, for he has claixed service only in the Second
Chief Directorate throughout his cereer and so cannot be expected
to know a high percentage of the First Chief bircctorate comple-
ment. Therefore, NOSENKO's intelligence personality identifications
do not constitute a factor in finding for or acainst his bona fides.

ge cc

NOSEXKO has been the source of many interesting details and
examples of KGB modus operandi (Pages 359-369), but while useful
for illustrative purposes and valuable because of the fact that
the meterial was easily coliatable for study purposes, nene of
the methods described could be consicered new and revealing, and
their exposure in any event would rot prevent their continued use
in the future. NOSENKO's ciscussior of the only double agent case
in whicn he claimed to have played a role, however, Gemonstrates
his lack of knowledge of the principles and purposes of such an
operation. This case, PELITSKIY, is a subjett of separate

sensitive sources
e 24, ten were identified by
and thereafter, and two became prominently
insecure KGB operations shortly after NOSEXKO identified them.

i *#Cther evidence has contredicted statenents by NOSENKO to the
effect that certain Soviets were not affiliated with the KGB; i
in Geneva, for example, «here he had daily access to the KGB i
Legal Residency for months and claimed nearly complete know- : |
ledge of KGB personnel, he named 15 of a KGB staff which he :
said totalled ac the most 18; CIA identifications of KGB offi- :

cers in Geneva on the basis of other sources, investigations

and analysis totalled at least double this number ard probably

triple, as many as 55 of the approximately 120 Soviets station-

| . ed there (a proportion which ts consistent with other-areas ~

; and defectors' estimates). NOSENKO was not entirely accurate

: concerning even KGB officers on his own delegation in Geneva,

i ROSEUKO's original identifications, positive or negative,

cannot be accepted without question.

discussion belcw. This subject, tvo, must be corsidered neutral
evidence in the bona fides assessment.

7 NOSENKO has shown himself to be both uninformed and inaccurate
in nis answers to questions on KGB Headquarters staff procedures
(Page 360 and Pages 619-624). He has been unadie to contribute .
any new information, although there has been no cetailed reporting s
on the subject since 1954. (GOLITSYN in 1962 provided some new '
material cn procedures but was never comprehensively cebriefed on :
the topic.) Thus, information on the more up-to-date forms, co- : |
ordinaticn requirements, mechanization of records and tracing
mechanisms, etc., could have been a singular contribution to our =
knowledge; NGSENKO could not describe anything of this sort. When
he replied to questions about such matters for the period covering |
his entry into the KGB. on which orevious reporting is available
in detail, he answered incorrectly cn numerous points. NOSENKO's . : I
tendency to improvise when he did not know the correct answer or 4
when he had forgotten has been characterized by a CIA psychelogist
as the behavior of a pathological liar saving face in a tight |
psychological situation. Khen he could not produce a correct

Vanswer in this area of reporting, NOSENKO may have improvised
because he is a liar or because he is concealing an ignorance

| based on Aot having been a KGB Headquarters officer.

3. Cperational Leads

a. Introduction |

Consideration of NOSENXO's operational leads must take into
account the KGB positions and personal associaticns {with attendant
access to information) which NOSENZO has claimed for himself. He
indicated Chat the breadth of his knowledge about KGB agent opera-
tions and development cases increased as he rose from case officer
in the U.S. Embassy Section in 1953-1955 and in the American Yourist
Section in 1955-1958 to become Deputy Chie‘ of the latter section
in 1958-1959, Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Secticn in 1960-1961,
and finally Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department from 1962 until
his defection. Simultaneously he established iasting contacts with
his KGB colleagues so that, for example, even after leaving the
U.S. Embassy Section for the second time, in December 1961, NOSENKO
kept abreast of its most important activities. On these grounds
NOSEUKO presented himself as an authoritative source, one who
could detail the successes and failures of the KGB in recruiting
Westerners--especially Americans--in the USSR over the years from
1953 through 1963. Repeatedly NOSENKO asserted that his leads to .
KGB agents constituted proof of his bona fides. ;

b. Operations Involving Americans

NCSENKO drew a picture of the recruitment scene in Moscow
showing that: :

-~ Since the—"ANDREY"-case of. the early 1950's* the KGB
recruited no Americans on the U.S. Embassy staff, succeed-
ing only in recruiting one contract employee who was in
Moscow on TDY. NOSENKO reported on recruitment approaches
to six American officials stationed in Moscow, all of whom

refused to collaborate with the KCB. He discussed 14 develop-
ment cases which never culmicated in recruitment approaches
to these U.S. Government employees in Moscow, and he named

11 officials at the Moscow Embassy who were investigated by
the KGS, These operations, NOSENXO assertcd, comprised the
total KGB activity against Enbassy personnel with the ex-
ception of the technical penetrations (see Part VIIT.B.4.).

~ Seven American correspondents in Mescow had been re-
cruited Ly the KGB, four of them known to NOSENKO from the
years 1953-1954 when he was working against U.S. newspaper-
men. Another two were under development by the KGB during
that period. .

- The ¢rmerican Express Company representative in Moscow,
Arsene FRIFPEL, had become a KGB agent in 1959; NOSENKO was
the case officer. .

- The number of American visitors recruited by the KG3
in 1962-1963 was 14, and if there had been others, NOSENKO
would have known about them in light of his senior position
in the Tourist Cepertment curing that period. Moreover, for
the years tefore 1962, NOSFNKO provided leads to 19 other
American tourists whom the KGB recruited, plus one who was
serving the GRU when he came to Moscow, NOSENKO. also de-
scribed 18 developnent cases and nine invectigations in
which the targets were American tourists.

As for KGB operations outside the Soviet Union, NOSENKO gave leads
to four recruited Americans about whom he learned through conver-
gations with KGB associates:. a U.S. intelligence officer having
the KGB cryptonym "SASHA" (still unidentified), a pen2tration of
Orly Courier Transfer Station (identified as Sergeant Robert Lee
JCHNSCN), and two agents in Gereva (naines not given and as yet nct
positively identified). NOSENKO leagned of the KS agent status
Goa" sfre G. LUNTA an Averican professor, because he tock part in

LUNT's|recruitment while on TOY ofia, and of the
Tegal Residency agent ee B because of the connection
between and Bernard KO an American tourist with whose

case NOSENKO was personally involved. In addition, NOSEJKO de-
scribed two development cases with U.S. citizens, From his know-
ledge of the “SASHA" operation, NOSENKO also knew that the KGB
had no ager.t sources able to supply information concerning the
Cuban missile crisis of October 1962.

(i) Completeness, Accuracy, Detail and Consistency of. Reporting

If he occupied the various KGB positions as claimed, if his
access were as broad as he said it was, NOSENKO has provided a.

| ceuprehensive. review of KGB operations involving Americans in

the USSR.

Other information, however, contradicts NOSENKO's assurances
that he reported on all major cases involving Americans working
at the U.S. Eubassy in Moscowz: «+

_- GOLITSYN's reports indicate that a U.S. military code
.Clerk was recruited in 1960, and other factors point toward
this person being James STORSBERG or possibly William HURLEY
(Pages 166-182). NOSENKO, the supervisor of operations
against Embassy code clerks.in 1960-1961, stated that

eg nee

Fe 00000

serene

STORSBERG rejected the recruitment approach, and when inter-
viewed on the basis of the NOSENKO lead, STORSBERG confirmed .
this. Both agree the approach was made in the latter part

of 1961. we

~ GOLITSYN's reports cover six other operations (Pages
595-598) which NOSENKO has not mentioned: The KG3's recruit-
ment of a female employee at zhe Embassy in 1957, the pre-
sence of a code clerk in the Embassy in 1960 who was a KGS
agent, an unsuccessful recruitment approach to a female sec-
retary at the Embassy prior to July 1960, the KG@ plan to
complete the recruitment of en Anericer diplomat following
his reassignment from Moscow in 1959, the KGB's recruitment
of or planned recruitment approach to a U.S. Embassy employee
(possibly a code clerk) prior to Aoril/May 1960, and a KGB
officer's trip to Helsinki to accompany an Embassy’code clerk -
traveliing py train to Moscow. (There is documentary evi-
dence to support the accuracy of GOLITSYN's statements ebout
the last of these cases: see below.)

cronee eed

On the basis of available information, NOSENKO cannot be
faulted on the completeness of his reporting about American tour-
ists recruited, approached, and under development by the KGB, but
he could cite only one instance of KGB investigations uncovering
tourists dispatched to the USSR by American Intelligence (Pages
145-150).* He knew nothing concerning two documents of CIA origin aoe
which described "legal travel" operations, one discussing forth-
coming tasks of American agents in the tourist season of 1959, a wee,
year in which NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the American Tourist
Section. These documents were placed in the hands of the KGB by
George BLAKE of MI-6 in July 1959 (before the end of the tourist
season) and in 1960; NOSENKO was not familiar with any aspects of
the KGB operation with 3LAKE, That the Tourist Department was
aware of U.S. Intelligence sending agents under tourist cover to
the Soviet Union in the years when NOSZNKO was Deputy Chief of
the American Tourist Section is demonstrable by four cases of
1958 and 1959 cited in’a KGB document supplied by GOLITSYN, NOS-
ENKO, although having no information on KGB countermeasures
against American tourists in 1958 and 1959, knew that the docu-
ment had been passed to CIA by GOLITSYN and that it had been
written in the Tourist Department. Where NOSENKO's reporting
on American tovrist cases is checkable, therefore, it has been
found to be incomplete.

—_——_—

* NOSENKO reported that of nine other tourists investigated by
the KGB, eight were suspected of having current connections
with American Intelligence. The KGB was correct with regard
to Thomas BARTHELEMY and Robert CHRISTNER, who were on CIA
missions, and Alfred SLESINGER, an FBI informant who neverthe-

less had no American Intelligence mission when he visited the
USSR in 1961° and 1962; Frederick BARGHOORN, arrested in the _
USSR in 1963, had been affiliated with U.S. military intelli-
gence many years before, and Ray GARTHOFF had severed his
association with CIA as an overt employee before he went to
Moscow in 1963. Concerning the rest reportedly suspected by
the KGB--Donald ALBINGER, Bernard KOTEN, and Gabriel REINER--
none was associated with American Intelligence in any way.

NOSEXKO's reporting on individual cases wherein he was a8 per-
sonal participant or supervisor is not, with few exceptions, con-
tradicted by information available from other sources. Nearly all
of his statements have proven accurate when they could be compared
with collateral information: In fact, the Americans whom he cited
did visit or live in the Soviet Union, and many of them are known
to have been of operational interest to the KGB, as NOSENKO said.
The exceptions to his general accuracy of reporting, however, are
of major importance in themselves and in reference to his claimed
positions in the U.S. Embassy. Section during 1960-1961:*

NOSENKO

U.S. Embas2y Security Officer
John V. ABIDIAN, for whom NOSENKO
was the responsible KGB officer,
visited the Pushkin Street dead
drop site in 1960 or at the begin-
ning of 1961, Later that same
day KOZLOV, Chief of.the KGB Sur-

veillance Directorate} went to the

\

scene.

/ - zs @
ale ae

KOSOLAPOV, NOSENKO's direct sub-
ordinate, made but one TDY to
Helsinki in the 1960-1961 period;

’ NOSENKO would have known about if
. not approved other TDY‘s in these

years wher he was Deputy Chief of
the U.S. Embassy Section.

Returning from his single TDY to
Helsinki, KOSOLAPOV was abroad

the same train as his target, the
American military code clerk Paul

JENNER; as supervisor of all oper-
' ations against code clerks at the
U.S. Enbassy, NOSENKO was familiar
with the details of all such major

activities.

The KGB knew that the U.S. mili-
tary code clerk James KZYSERS,
whom NOSENKO personally contacted
in an effort to persuade him to

defect, did not report the earlier

recruitment approach by the KGB.

Collateral

CIA records on the PETKOVSKIY
case, in which the Pushkin
Street dead drop was used, snow
that ABIDIAN visited the site
only once, on 30 December 1961
at 1130 hours. KOZLOV left New
York City on the same day,
travelling via France, at the
completion of a TDY in the
United States. (Pages 231-
235; this subject is discussed
at greater length in Part
VIII.B.6.)

Travel records show that KOSO-
LAPOV was twice in Helsinki
during 1960, in March-April
and again in November. (Pages
186-200) .

Travel records show that JENNER
and KOSOLAPOV travelled on
separate days. (Pages 186-200)

KEYSERS reported the recruitment
approach immediately after it
occurred, and the report was
submitted in an Embassy room
later found to have a concealed
microphone. (NOSENKO stated that

the was a customer for microphone

intercepts at the time and that
this micrephone was monitored on
a@ continuous basis by KGB per-
sonnel.) (Pages 213-219)

—_—

* An example of NOSENKO's inaccuracy on events during his later
service in the Tourist Department related to his accounts on the
arrest of American Professor Frederick BARGHOORN: According to
NOSENKO, the approval for this KGB action in which he had 4 per-
sonal part was obtained from BREZHNEV in KHRUSHCHEV's absence
from Moscow, and the arrest was made a few hours later; BARG-
HOORN was arrested on 31 October 1963, and on that day and the
day before KHRUSHCHEV made public appearances in Moscow, (BREZH-

NEV was not seen in Moscow betwe

650.:

In addition, a number of Americans--e.g., Walter RASK, Adam
BROCHES, Henry APISSON, Herbert HOWARD, Vasiliy VOLKOV, dilliam
WALLACE, Thomas Whitney, and Stanley ZIRING--denied having keen
recruited by the KGB, as NOSENKO said they had been.

The only noteworthy internal inconsistencies in NOSENKO's
reporting on KGB operations involving Americans appear in the
HARMSTONE case, where he has given conflicting information on the ~.,
KGB's ability to obtain photographic evidence of his homosexuality,
and in his advice on how to identify “ANDREY"--that he was the only ji
witness to testify in Roy RHCD=S' trial and that he did not testify 7)
at Roy RHODES' trial but was enly interviewed in the pre-trial in-
vestigation once, Part VIIL.D. covers the extent of his knewledge
about American cases in which he took part persoraliy or as &
supervisor. Regarding others to which his official positions did
net give him access, NOSENKO has indicated that it was his per~-
sonal contact with KGB colleagues which enabled him to report on }
nine recruitments (Herbert HOWARD, Sam JAFFE, the KG3 agent in
France, the YOUNGER couple, “SASHA", and two unnamed agents in.
Geneva); three development cases (George VAN LAETHEM, Attorney”
General Robert KENNEDY, and Stephen HOFFMAN); three unsuccessful
recruitment approaches (Richard HARMSTONE, Peter BINDER, and
Collette SCHWARZENBACH); and three investigations (Thomas BARTHE-
LEMY, Lewis BOWDEN, and George WINTERS). WOSEIKO's alleged asso-
Ciates in the KGA thus gave him the names of four recruited agents
and sufficient details for one more to be identified by subsequent
investigation, JOHNSON. All of the NOSENKO leads to developmental
operations, unsuccessful recruitment approaches, and investigations
have been identified.

(14) Damage to the Soviets

Three criteria can. be used in assessing the harm to Soviet
interests caused by NOSENKO's operational leads to Americans:

First, the originality of nis information on recruited
agents and unsuccessful recruitment approaches;

: . Second, the agents' access to classified information
: , at the time he reported on them; and

: Third, the possibility of identifying them on the
: : basis of the details provided or in ceviirs tion with details
H 7 received from other’ sources. -

. There is no reason to believe that NOSENKO's information on 22

; Americans under investigation while in the USSR could have damaged

i the KGB, especially since all of them had left the Soviet Union

: before the NOSENKO leads were received (Pages 402-410). In an-

ae -- --other- category, -NOSENKO''s. leads to.35..Americans under development. _
: (Pages 379-397), there is no means for evaluatiag their impor-

tance to the KGB because it is impossible to estimate with con-
fidence the likelihood of the KGB recruiting sone or any of these ; :
targets; vulnerability and assessment data, when coupled with |

: spasmodic or even continuing KGB access to the target, would be :

i no guarantee that he is recruitable. Nevertheless, following

: the criteria listed above, NOSE..40's statements on KGB operation-

i al interest stemming from their homosexuality did bring about the . i
recall of Robert ARMSTRONG and Stephen HOFFMAN from the U.S. i
Embassy in Moscow. '

14-00000

NOSENKO was the first source to report on the KGB recruit-
ments of 22 tourists {none with access to classified meterials
and on 11 of whom there was previous derogatory information):
four correspondents (one said by NOSi..KO to have pecome inactive
and on two of whom there was previous derogatory information):
the American Express Company representative in Moscow; a contract.
employee of USIA who had earlier declared his intent to marry 4
Soviet national; and two agents whose names were not known to
NOSENKO but who were identifiable. The latter two agents were:

- Dayle W. SMITH (KGB cryptonym “"ANDREY"), a cipher
machine mechanic at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow recruited in
1953. Despite NOSENKO's statement that "ANDREY" was current-
ly supplying valuable information in June 1962, SMITH lost
his access to classified information through retirement from
the U.S. Army on 30 November 1961, or about six months before
NOSENKO first reported on him (Pages 413-426).

- U.S. Army Sergeant Robert Lee JCHNSCH, who with his
wife Hedwig began collaborating with the KGB in i952 and
who made James MINTKENBAUGH an agent of the KGB in 1953
(Pages 627-462). Hedwig JOWUNSCN discontinued her role in
the operation in 1953, although thereafter remaining know-
ledgeable of the KGB activities of her husband and MINTKEN-
BAUGH; according to MINTKENBAUGH, who lost eccess to classi-
fied information in 1954, he had no direct contact with the
KGB after the late summer or early autumn of 1963 (about
three to five months before NOSENKO first gave the lead on
JOHNSON) ; JOHNSON was still on active duty with the U.S.
Army and in contact with the KGB when NOSENKO reported in
January 1964 about the existence of this agent.

Thus from a total of 30 original and identifiable leads, only one
agent had access to classified information as of the date when
NOSENKO's reporting on him began. By the criteria given in the
preceeding paragraph, the single operational lead from NOSENKO
which could have damaged Soviet interests was that which un-
covered JOHNSON.

It is debatable, however, whether the JOHNSON lead consti-
tuted a serious loss to the KGB. In the first place, if JOHNSON
can be believed, he gave the Soviets but one classified document
while in charge of the “Ctassified Control Center" at Camp Des
Loges between August 1963 and May 1964. His KGB case officer
later told him, JORNSON said, that the information he could pro-
vide was not worth the risk involved and that no future attempts
of this sort should be made. JOHNSON also stated that he felt
his espionage work at Camp Des Loges had not been very profitable
for the Soviets, adding that his case officer had shown dis-
interest in his proposal to obtain for the KG? a top secret
document he (JOHNSON) thought_of greater importance than any |
other to which he had access. (NOSENKO indicated that JOHNSON ~
Jost his access in the spring of 1963, while at the Orly Courier
Transfer Station.) In the second place, as the KGB knew, the
behavior of Hedwig JOHNSON, a mental case, was unpredictable.
Finally, the JOHNSON couple and MINTKENBAUGH repeatedly dis-
regarded the KGB's instructions to compartment their activities
and to observe other routine security precautions. The KGB
seems to have avoided full exploitation of JOHISOn in the latter
stages of the operation, to have been concerned over Hedwig's
mental condition ag early as 1962, and to have regarded the

threesome as difficult handling problems. Given these apparent
factors, the NOSENXO lead may have been consicered expencabie by
the KGB, without iong-lasting adverse effect cn the fulfillment
of its overall intelligence requirements.

j NOSENKO was the first source to identify James STORSBEFG, a

\ target who had rejected the KGB's recruitment offer (Pages 165-

that the KGB recruited either STOKSBERG or Wiliiam HURLEY (who i
NOSENKO said was rct recruited or approached by thé KG3). If it
is-assumed that STCRSBERG was not recruited in the approach de-
scribed by NOSENKO and in the operation discussed by GOLITSYN,
the KGS suffered no loss in the American services learning of
this case. 1f it is assumed cn the other hand that STCRSBERG or
HURLEY was recruited, the reporting by NOSENXO assisted the KGB--
not the American services--by deflecting security investigations
from a recruited agent of the KGB. . . ‘

-(iii) Importance or Usefulness

‘Whe American leads from NOSENKO enabled U.S. security author-
ities to: i"

- Confirm previous information on the recruitmuents of
-~ 13: tourists and three correspondents;

- Verify previous derogatory information on 11 tourists,
two correspondents, and perhaps one ‘military code clerk,
STORSBERG;

- Remove two homosexuals from the U.S. Embassy in .
Moscow; and .
~ Identify 32 KGB agents including Hedwig COHNSON and
MINTKENBAUGH. *
One or possibly two of these 32 agents (SMITH and possibly HOWARD)
in the past had been in a position to pass classified infcrmation
to the KGB, and a third (JOHNSON) had current access to classified
information and current contact with the KGB; the two homosexuals |
at the Moscow Embassy (APMSTRONG and HOFFMAN) presumably also had |: - :

access to classified information. From the standpoint of pro-

___tecting the security of the U.S. Government, NOSENKO brought t

an end the JOHNSON operation and the KGB's potential for recr
ing ARMSTRONG and HOFFMAN. . ae

Against this product of NOSENXO's reporting must be balanced
the amourts of money and manpower that were needed for U.S. secu-
rity authorities to exhaust and investigate NOSENKO’s information . :
on 49 recruitments, 35 developmental targets, seven unsuccessful
recruitment approaches, ard 33 investigations by the XGB--a total
of 113 operational leads. CIA carried the burden of the debriefing
and interregation of NOSEKO on these cases, but the investigative

 ¥-"anong these 32 agents were many whom the XGB had not recontacted
after their return to the United States from the Soviet Union,
others who had breken contact with the KGS, some who were known

work in the United States was accomplished ros ty “by other
agencies. It would seem, however, that the JOHNSON operation
was the only NOSENKO lead to be important or useful.

(av) Remarks

Judged by his major inaccuracies and by the ecemonstrable in-
completeness in some of his reporting, NOSENKO is not an authori-
tative or reliable source of information on cperations against
Americans by the U.S. bassy Section and the American Tourist

‘Section. Proven untrustwortay in other categories of operational
ileads, there is no reascn to accept at face value NOSENKO's state-
iment that SMITH’was the only Moscew Empassy eaplcyee working with

“the KGB from i953 thrcugh 1963; indeed, evicence to the contrary

exists. The same may be true regarding American tourists and
correspondents in Moscow, i.e., other recruitmeats not mentioned
by NOSENKO could have occurred. Furthermore, with the question-
able exception of the JOHNSON case, the KGB lost nothing of great
value in consequence of NOSENKO'S leads but gained an advantage
by occupying the attention and facilities of American security
authorities.

It is therefore concluded that NOSENKO has withhold infor-
mation on recruitrents of Americans in !ioscéw, or he is unable to
provide a comprehensive review cf such activities because he did
not _hold_the claimed positions in the U.S. Emcassy and American
Tourist Sections. Either explanation forces strong reservations
about the bona fides of NOSENKO as a genuine scurce, and these
reservations are reinforced by the relative costs to the KGB and
U.S. security authorities of the NOSENKO leads.. By itself, this
evaluation of his production on American cases suggests the possi-
bility that the KGB dispatched NOSEXXO to report to CIA, and that
the KGB did so for tre purpose of misleading the U.S. security
services.

c. Cperations Involving Other Westerners
(i) Introduction

As already indicated, NGSENXO's principal knowledgeability
of KGB operations is related to Americans in the Soviet Union.
With the exception of one German and one Norwegian tourist case,
his only other personal participation in third-national (i.e., non-
American) operations stems from his ageociation with the section
of the Tourist Department concerned with United singdom and Canad-
ian, as well as /userican, tourists. Where he has commented on
sources fcr the rest of his third-national leads, he indicated
his knowledge was acquired either through conversaticns with
other officers or through his position as Reputy Chief of the
Tourist Department in 1962-1963. Thus he made no claim for com-
pleteness of his coverage, nor necessarily for absolute accuracy
and ful! details on eny one case. No attempt will be made here,
therefore, to compare his infcrmuticn with ether sources, except
in terms of whether NCSENKO'S reporting harmed the Soviets and
assisted American security.

(ii) Discussion

; Of the 90 thire-naticaal secruitment leads (Pages 474-502),
\22 have not yet~been positively icentiticd. These cannot be

evalueted at all except to point cut that only two cf then 2ne.

knowing the status of these two overaticns at the time NOSENKO
told CIA about them, it is not possible to measure the value to
tus or the damage to the Soviet Union thrcugh the compromise of

,these cases.

Of the remaining 68 known or possible agents who have been
identified, 35 were unique leads when NOSENKO provided them. No
conclusive investigation results have yet been ebtained on 30 of
these, but the majority were said by NOSENKO to be travel agency
employees (guides, bus drivers, etc.). Five of the 30 held
positions of trust in their respective governments; these five

security and potential damage to the KGB. Of the five who have been

Aamiralty documents identified by GOLITSYN, having narrowed
their list of suspects to 20 (including VASSALL) by 11 June 1962.
When they received the fragnent of NOSEXKO information which
focused on the British Embassy in Moscow, the number was reduced
to VASSALL and one other. Although the HOSEVKO information
apparently confirmed the already solid suspicions of VASSALL,
there is reascr lieve that the igentification would have
been Bccomplished without this information. The lead was theré-
fore not new or exclusive information, and NOSENKO himself ad-
mitted in 1964 that he knew that GOLITSYN had known of the case
from the latter's work in the Information (Reports) Department.

success--to cestroy through a canpaign of scandal.

(iii) Remarks

On the tasis of the above examination, NOSLNKO's information
on KGB operations against third-nationals cannot ve considered 6
positive factor in the assessment of his bona fiees, As 8-poss-
ible negative factor in consideration of his bona fides, the in-
significance of NOSENKO's reporting on third-national leads must
be measured against the criteria of his claimed access and con-
trary evidence. In the case of foreign tourists his leads show--
and he himself has commented--that such recruirments were of no
particular value: assuming that NOSENKO was Deputy Chier of th?
Tourist Department, he snould be able to make such a statement
without challenge. To @ate no indepenient evidence of foreign
tourist recruitments has emerged which contradicts him. Opera-
tions against other Western embassies in Moscow are a slightly
different matter. NOSENKO's information, or lack thereof, can-
not be evaluated on the basis of completeness because he has made
no claim to full access to such information or to positions which
would have given him better access- _Except for tnose he said he
was informed of in connection with possibie use against u.Ss.
Embassy targets, he has usually sourced such third-national
leads as he did have to particularly close relations with the
responsible case officer. ‘It would not be valid to argue that
a source cf one lead should have told him of others, OF that -he
should have had mere close friends in the KGB. Thus on all
applicable criteria, the NOSEXKO leads to operations against
third-naticnals must be excluded as a factor weighing for or
against his bona fides. .

4. Technical Operations Against the U.S. Emtag sy

a. Discussion

In reporting on KGB microphones in the U.Se Fiibassy (Pages
248-269), NOSENKO said in 1962 that there were at that time “four
or five points," later adding a sixth, from witch conver pat sons
were heard. They included the offices of the Mintarec Counselor,
the Military Attache, the Naval Attache, the Alr Atvache, ONG
(unidentified) "State Department employee," ang the ajycicultura

Which NOSENKO said were of operational interest to the KGB but
could not say how many of them there were or whom they concerned;
and the Military Attache’s planning of trips «hich permitted the
KGB to seize equipment in Stalingrad in 1955. Of these three
examples given by an cfficer who seid he culled all the micro-

1955; NOSENKU said he played no stch role).* .
In 1964 NOSENKO Erought to CIA a sheet of paper which he
said was in KOVSHUK's handwriting ard which had been obtained in
1960 or 1961 during a conference (Pages 260-251). This, he said
then, was how he knew of the exact locations of all the actively

* A comparison betweer NOSENKO'S chird exanple and a 1956 messace
from a sensitive source who is believed to have been compromis-
ed to the KGB after that messace (but before 1962) reveals sim-
ilarities which may not be coincidental.

- NOSENKO (11 June 1962; see Page 260): "We are listening
to your Military Attaches there. We know where they intend
to travel, what they want to find out. We know what machin-
ery and what targets interest tren... Some of the things
they say are surprising. They discuss, among other things,
where to go, what %o see, what to take with them - electric
equipment or not. And we are hunting for this electronic
equipment and now have permission, 1f we are absolutely cer-
tain that one of your people is taking electronic apparatus
with him on an intelligence trip outside Moscow, to take, to
steal it. We-now have authorizstion to take any necessary
steps to steal it. Because you now have improved your equip-
ment. .We stole some equipmert in Stalingrad in 1955..."

- Sensitive source, 1956 (see Pase 254): °... All rooms
are being monitored by the KSB... The ‘flap’ involving the
American directior, - finding specialists in Stalingrad in
the summer of 1955 «as organized by the KGB because conver-
sations were overneard in the rooms of the American Embassy.
As you know, a3 4 result of this flap, the KG3 seized valu-
able direction-finding equipment from the American Intelli-
gence officers...” .

It is possible that both NOSENKO and the sensitive source were
reporting a well-knowm event, because GOLITSYN reported in
1962 that the 1955 Stalingrad incident was written up in KGB
training materials a5 an example of Second Chief Directorate
work. The training version may have included the role of the
microphone informat1on {although GOLITSYN did not report that
it did), which may thus have come naturally to the attention
of NOSENKO and the s#snsitive source. However, this would call
into question NUSENKO's allegation of direct access to all of
the microphone product.

monitored and productive "points" 1n 1960-1961. NCSENKO was not
able to explain why he would need this list to know the locations
of the microphones when he had been daily receiving, selecting,
and distributing the product of all of them for two years. Sim-
flarly, it was never clear why NOSENKO did not remember in 1962
that there were eleven points--as the list showed--rather than
the four-to-3i1x NOSENKO reported on in 1962.

NOSENXO's account of how the product from the microphones was
distributed and exploited would inevitably mean that all KGB case
officers who had served in the U.S. Embassy Section since the
microphones were installed would know of their existencs--despite
any effort to paraphrase and disguise the product ag “agent re-
ports,” NOSENKO nonetheless maintained in 1962 that “it is a
tremendous secret that we are listening to you," and that the
microphones were known to so few that any countermeasures the
Americans might take on the basis of NOSENKO's statements could
reflect dangerously cn him as’ the source.* .

Accepting at face value NCSENKO's claimed lack of aptitude
and interest in technical matters, and therefore nis inability
© provide specific technica! details concerning electronic oper-
ations against the American Embassy, it is still noteworthy that:

- NOSENKO did not know the purpose of the so-called
“Moscow beam," sometimes saying it was to jam Embassy
communications and at other times that it was used to
monitor them.

- Although he claimed to have personally participated
in the planning for the installation of audio devices in
the North Wing of the Embassy, he dic not know of the ex-
istence or the purpose of the coaxial cables and grill
found there by American technicians in 1964. (NOSENKO
insisted that there were no audio devices installed in the
North Wing at the time of its, renovation for occupancy
by Americans.)

: ~ NOSENKO knew nothing of the general lines of research
and development to substitute for or improve the fading
microphone coverage of the U.S. Embassy.

These three points relate to aspects of the KGE's audio-technical
attack on the U.S. Embassy in which the reporting of a source in
NOSENKO's claimed position, no matter what his technical aptitude,
could have been detrimental to Soviet interests.

/  ® Both GOLITSYN and the 1956 source cited on Page 254 were First

Chief Directorate officers. That they both knew of the micro-
phones suggests that NOSEXKO exaggerated the sensitivity of
the microphone cperation, which had moreover always been
assumed by the Embassy to be active.

b. Remarks

NOSENKO's sourcing of his informacion on electronic opera-
tions against the U.S. Embassy in Moscow was unclear and unlikely.
His knowledge of the location and production of these microphones,
as well as the existence, nature, and purpose of other electronic
operations directed against the Embassy, was not commensurate with
his alleged position in the U.S. Bnbassy Section and his particu-
lar responsibility for audio sperations. Significartly, the
essential element of the information which NOSENXO did report,
the exister.ce of the microphone in the Minister Counselor's
office, would presumably have been considered by the KGB to have
been compromiBea Six months earlier, with the defection or WOLit-
SYNs—Discovery of this microphone, as an outgrowth of action on
GOLITSYN's informstion, would have ted t> all the others. Thus
the Embassy microphones must have been censidered by the KGB to
have been compromised before NOSENKO first spoke of them in 1962,
idadec to this is the fact (supported by NCSENKO himself) that
the efficiency of the Embassy microphone installation as a whole
fad seriously diminished by late 1961 or early 1962 due to, first,
normal deterioration of equipment and wiring and, second, the
installation of secure rocms and the implerentation of more
stringent security precautions at the Embassy. For these reasons
and in the absence of any information concerning other forms of
electronic attack against the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, it cannot
be considered that the information provided by NOSEXKO in 1962
and 1964 wags harmful to the interests of the KSB nor helpful to
Ane n_authorities, NOSENKO's Genial of any installations in
the north wirg, in the light of the later discovery there of
coaxial cables, the purpose of which appears serious and is as
yet unclarified, and in the light of NOSENKO's specific claim to
have been responsible for the operational planning for the north
wing at the time it was being prepared for Aterican occupancy,

would appear to be purposeful deception.

5, The BELITSKIY Case

a. Introduction ;
NOSEIKO reported to CIA in June 1962 (as one of the two items
he wanted to sell) that one of its agents. the Soviet interpreter
RELITSKIY, was in fact a KGB double agent who had been planted on
CIA (Pages 517-529). NOSENKO said that this was a case run by the
° Second ("Active Line") Section, but thet he personally had a role
in the management of the case in May 1962 in Geneva. NOSENKO was
able to give certain inside information on this case; for exempie,
he knew the nicknames used by the CIA case officers with the agent.

b. Discussion

NOSENKO's information, at least in its general outlines, was
correct. CIA had been running BELITSKIY as an agent, and the CIA
case officers (alias "Bob" and "Henry," the latter from Washington
as NOSENKO said) nad just completed a series of meetings with
BELITSKIY in Geneva. Important aspects of his information were
inaccurate: HELITSKIY had been recruited @ year before NOSENKO's
date of 1959, and in Brussels, not London. Also, NOSENKO's claim
that this was a Second Chief Directorete operation aimed at en-
ticing CIA into meetings in the USSR was not borne out by the
history of the case or by PELITSKIY's conduct, although it cannot
be excluded that this was a long-term objective which the KGB
still sought without appearing to. NOSENKO's account of the case
thus is not as accurate as could be expected if his own role in
it had been as claimed.

NOSENKO's description of his own involvement is not consis-
tent with observed Soviet practice or with operational logic.
NOSENKO said in both 1962 and_1964 that he had had orders to
supervise the handling Of this case in Geneva in the spring of
1962. The reason was that the case officer for BELITSKIY in
Geneva .(ARTEMEV) was young and inexperienced and had not even
worked on the BELITSKIY case before. NOSENKO was saying in
effect--with the authority of direct knowleige and official re-
sponsibility--that BELITSKiY, a prominent Soviet citizen having
personal contacts with well placed members of the Soviet Govern-
ment, a man who had beer under the ostensible control of a hos-
tile intelligence service (CIA) for four years, was sent by the
: KGB to Geneva for the purpose of recontacting CIA, with pre-

i pared information, but that the KGB did not send with him the

E responsible case officer or any member of the section responsible

i for the operation. Instead, the KGB turned over the responsi-

i bility to a young and inexperienced KGB officer who happened to
be in Geneva to protect the security of a delegation and who
haa had no prior connection with the BELITSKIY case nor even
local knowledge of Geneva conditions; then, after BELITSKIY was
already in Geneva, the KGB had cabled instructions that NOS=NKO,
who had no need: to know of the case and had learned of it only
unofficially from conversations in 1960-1961 with the Section
Chief responsible, who had no experience or training in handl-
ing double agent operations, and who was similarly in Geneva

by chance with delegation security functions, shoulé guide the
other “less experiencei” case officer.* As NOSENKO showed
under questioning, he did nct know the contents of any of the
positive intelligence BELITSKIY was to pass to CIA as disinfor-
mation; he did not know BELITSKIY's Moscow or Geneva pattern

of movement or contacts; he did not know in detail how or when
the operation started; he did not know the nature of degree of
British involvement, nor the operational details and contact
arrangements. NOSENKO said that BELITSKIY had been placed ona
Geneva delegation in the hope that CIA might be able to *find"
and recontact him, **

c. Remarks

The circumstances above not only cast doubt on NOSENKO’s
version of the case and his own accesg but also suggest that
NOSENKO did not have a theoretical appreciation of how double
agents are handled. The examples he gave of his "guidance" to
ARTEMEV are few in number. NOSENKO also stated in 1964 that he
had arranged the actual introduction to LELITSKIY of KISLOV, the
TASS man, to provide for BELITSKIY's neca of a notional subsource
for some of his disinformation; NOSENKO by October 1966 had appar-
ently forgotten this event, for he stated unequivocally that KiS-
LOV had had no connection whatever with the BELITSKIY case. NOS-
ENKO claimed to have met BELITSKIY, but did not recognize his
pheto when shown it in 1966.

Did NOSENKO's report to CIA on the BELITSKIY case harm the
KGB? It was useful to CIA, since despite freguently expressed
doubts oF BELITSKIY’s bona fides, CIA vas handling the operation
as if it were genuine (but not intending to go to the extent of
exposing to BELITSKIY CIA assets inside the USSR). (The KGB is

¥NOSENRO has reported that he handled only one American agent
(FRIPPEL); he had practically no knowledge of CIA nor even
vicarious exposure to the substance of any other double agent
operations. ARTEMEV had had extended contact with a CIA
tourist agent as early as August 1958, a role in other opera~
tions against American tourists in 1959--including clandestine
search (see Page 146), and continuous American Department
service since then. NOSENKO did not know of the 1932-1959
operational activities of ARTEMEV, although they feil in the
operational area NOSENKO claimed to have supervised at the
time as Deputy Chief of the American Tourist Section.

#* NOSENKO was seemingly unaware that BELITSKIY had contact
arrangements which would presumably guarantee recontact.

aware, as Suviet Bloc counterintelligence guidance demonstrates,
of the dangers inherent in having disinformation recognized as
such.) The meetings in Geneva in May 1962 would have made it
clear to the KGB that CIA had no intentions of meeting BELITSKIY
inside the USSR, and, in KGB eyes, the case may have reached the
point of diminishing returns. It is perhaps significant that
NOSENKO did not contact CIA and report on the BELITSKIY case until
10 days efter BELITSKIY's series of meetings with CIA in Geneva
had been completed, which would have given the KGB time for final
appraisal of the operation's potential.

NOSENKO's account of his own role in this operation appears
to have been false, and nothing in the available evidence would
preclude Soviet sacrifice of this already tired operation. Since
NOSENKO provided some inside details of a sensitive KCB operation
which could have been known to only a few, it is difficult to
find any other explanation of NOSENKO's access to.this information
except that the KGB briefed him about it.

a. Compromise of POPCY
(41) Introduction

che compromise of POPOV, the
CIA penetration source in the Cxv {Pages 530-534) could affect
the evaluation of NOSENKO's production. If what NOSENKO has said
is basically true, his story of FUPCV's compromise (which has also
been reported by other sources) is not particularly important and
has not harmed the KGB ror measurakly assisted CIA: The KGB
assumes an ewareness by CIA thet it conducts surverliance of U.S.
Embassy personnel, especially those heving known cr suspected An-
erican Intelliyence connections (as with LANGELLE and, WINTERS).
If NOSENKO or the other hand has been incemplete or inaccurate

in his statements about tie compromise of FCPOV, then his clzims
to knowledgeability on this subject mest be questioned.

The only other evidence available is analytical. POPOV was
transferred to the Illegals handling unit in Berlin on 26 June
1957, an assignment of high sensitivity. Until mid-August he
handled five Illegals, thereafter only one, TAIROVA, in October
1957. - Following home leave from 12 December 1957 to 19 January
1958, he was again transferred, this time to a position where
Illegals and productive GRU sources of antelligence were not ex-
posed to him. Between March and November 1958 there were signs
of a KGB investigation of the Illegals handling. unit where POPOV

formerly served, and he was recalled to Moscow ‘in: November of that:

year. These facts can be interpreted as follows:: .

- POPOV's status as a CIA source was not compromised before
his transfer to the Illegals handling unit.

- POPOV's status was compromised before his recall to Moscow
in November 1958, probably before his reassignment from the
Illegals hendling unit in January 1958, and possibly some time
earlier. The latter possibility is apparent from the Soviets’
knowledge that the TAIROVA couple was under surveillance in
December 1957 (and until March 1958); it is also noteworthy
that, after having met five Illegals in less than one and one-
half months prior to 13 August 1957, POPOV subsequently was
involved personally with only one other, TAIROVA, in October
1957.

- The KGB, realizing that POPOV was a CIA source, chose to
keep him in Berlin until November 1958 in order to investigate
the possibility of his operating in conjunction with other
CIA sources. .

This line of reasoning, if accepted, would confirm GOLITSYN's in-
formation that a KGB agent compromised POPOV prior to the arrival
of ZHUKOV in Berlin, an arrival date falling some time before

23 November 1957.

reportedly did state that the KGB learned from an agent in
about 1957 (GOLITSYN's estimate) that American Intelligence
had a source which had provided GRU information.

#*ee*eThis date, which is consistent with that cited in the final

NOSENKC, GSBRRORR, and the “official KGE report" attribute the
compromise to the fact thet surveillance deteccted a meeting be-
tween Mrs. CHISHOLM and the Soviet whem the KCB later identified
as PEXKOVSKIY. NCSENKO dated this as around Noverher or December
1961, the official report stated this ccecurred on 30 December 1961,
ard GQee Hm did not give a date.

gave the cause as surveillance, cut of Greville WYNNE
end PENKCVCKIY rather than Mrs. CHISUCLM, ard stated that the com-
promise Gated from May 1962. GERENGABEADPPR gave two different
accounts, one that F SGVSKLY was investiyited for reasons unre-
lated to eny suspicions of espionage and was thereby fourd out as
a spy, the other that his excessive spending ere sale of foreign
mercnandise led to an investigation which resulted ain detection of
his espionage activities. Sha placed the timing of the first ver-
sion in 19651, without citing the time of year; ia the second, she

* See Paces 535-547 for discussion of this case.

**It does nct seem tnusual for several sources to have reported
on the compromise cf PENKOVSK1Y: Fresumably this was the sub-
ject of widespread discussicn within the two Soviet services,
for it was covered in the Soviet press and ir at least one
“official report" disseminated by the KGB. Altnough their
differing situations within the Soviet services could partially
explain the differing versions thet these sources have given,
some of them revertnheless have claimed either direct knowledge
of the compromise or specially informed sub-sources. There-
fore the discrepancies among the reporting of NOSENKO on the
PEXKOVSKIY compromise, the accounts by other sources, and the
facts on the handling of the case by CIA and MI-6 are pertinent
to the question of NOSENKO's bona fides

PENKOVSKIY that ke had visited the site after he chose it in 1960,
although it is poss:ble, especially as he h3d not been informed
of ASIDIax having been sent to check on a possible signal from
him about the dead drop. sensitive co:ree

, however, makes it clear
that the ABL i visit sas not the ‘first observed activity :
at Pushkin Street to stir KGB investigative interest in the’!
site. As the report states, when massive surveiilance of |
U.S. Embassy targets detected an American visiting this
address the first time, he was not followed inside by sur-
veillants, bot on the second occasion he was followed
closely and the surveillant observed that he was kneeling
down apparently tying his shoe.* ESR went on to say
that, although this was not very unusual, it was sufficient
to arouse suspicion in view of the fact that this American
had been observed visiting the sane address on two occasions
for no apparent reason, There is no question about the

fact that ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street drop site on
one cceasion only, and that #as on 30 December 1961. The
reference to this as a eecond visit to this address by an
American fron the Embassy is a clear indication that the
KGB hed surveilied the first such visit, which was mace

by the CIA officer MAHONEY** in Jeazary 1961, and not by
ABIDIAN, Thus where Gis be Bie fee erred by indicating
one Anerican went to Fushkin Sireet twice, the KGB must

have known that MAHONEY went there first, in January 195%
and ABIDIAN went there next, on 30 December: 1951, GQgHRes
said that the 24-hour fixed surveillance resulted frem

the second visit, and beccuse of it FEIKOV3KIY was sub-
sequently observed to enter the vestibule of this address
but did not visit anyone there. it was decermined that

no one living at thet address knew PINKOVSKIY and he be-
came a target of KGB suspicion and estigation.

The rest of the story is completely in disagreement
with the facts of the case and does not warrant discussion here.
It must ke noted, nonetheless, that this is the only instance
among all the versions which places the compromise cn the Aner- ~
jican side of the case, and the only one which makes a direct
connection between the Pushkin Street dead drop and the KGB
detection of PENKOVSKIY. (All others attribute the compromise
to surveillance of British Embassy personnel, and NOSENKO claim-
ed that the KGB was unaware of American Intelligence participa-~
tion until the operation was terminated.) It is also in direct
conflict with NOSEXKO, who had no knowledge of any U.S. Embassy
official visiting the Pushkin Street site prior to ABIDIAN, In
this regard, NOSEIKO insisted that the date of ASIDIAN's visit

* ABIDIAN reported that a woman encered the vestibule behind
him while he was in there, and he knelt down pretending to

tie his shoelaces until she proceeded past him and on up the
stairs.

**NOSENKO was not aware that MAHONEY had beer identified to the
KGB as a CIA officer well before MAHONEY's October 1960 arri-
val in Moscow.

might have visited the site a year or two earlier than ARIDIAN.

(iii) Remarks

‘6 :
NOSENKO did not know or did not report to CIA that the i
only other American who hed visitej the Pushkin Street dead drop — . j
area was MAHONEY. This fact suggests that either NOS=&TKO was oa
deliberately withholding from CiA information of vital import-
ance in the PENKOVSKIY compromise. or he was unaware of the - , 4
KGB's possession of this information, despite his claimed posi-
tion in the U.S. Embassy Section and responsibility for cover-
age of ABIDIAN. The fact that his story on the PENKOVSKIY
compromise, like the “official report" of the KGB, does rot
show the seriousness of the evidence in the KGe's possession
as of 27 May 1961 additionally points to his withholding of in-
formation on the subject of the timing of PEIKOVSKIY’s coampro- :
mise, which was definitely no later than this date. If NOSEIKO . 4
was deliberately withholding information on this subject and ‘
lying sbout the PENKOVSKIY Compromise, then he is rot 4 bona
fide defector. If he ts unaware of the information which the
KGB has in its possession, then he was not in the U.S. Enbassy
Section in 1960 or 196) as claimed, ard hence’ his bena fides
would be disproven.

c. Compromise of CHEREPANOV
(4) Introduction

NOSENKC‘s stories on the compromises of POPOV and PENKOV~-
SK1IY were examined for their accuracy as to timing and cause, In
the case of CHEREPANOV (Pages 548-558), there is no question about
when the so-called CHEREPANOV papers were passed, nor how the KGB
openly learned of the U.S. Embassy's possession of the papers.
The chief question is the authenticity of the documents themselves,
with the subsidiary implications, if they are not authentic, that
the passage of the papers was instigated by the KGB, and that
there could have been neither a compromise of nor a search for
SEREPANOV, as described by NOSENKO and attested to by his travel
authorization {see also Part VIII.D.8.).

(ii) The Operational Plan in Draft

Examination of one draft document--the operational plan
against the CIA of ficer 'WINTERS-~reveais ‘the following points
related to forn:

- Although only a draft, the title of the case officer,
the designation of his office, the title of his supervisor
as approving authority, and the designaticn of his office
component as well as the title of the confirming authority
(the nead of the department) are spelled out in full, even
including the subordination of the KGB to the Council of
Ministers of the USSR. KGB practice, as reported by
cther sources and as logic would dictate, does not require
that this be done, cumbersome as these designations are,
and the typist routinely fills them in as the official
copy is typed from the draft.

- Although only a draft, this document has been signed
by KOVSHUK as being approved, which is against common
sense and KGB practice. NOSENKO himself noted this dis-
crepancy, asking himself aloud why KOVSHUK had done’ this.

ca

- Although only a draft, the name of the target of
the plan appears several times, but earlier KGB defectors
have stated and NOSENKO himself has confirmed that the
name is left out of drafts so the typist in the typing
pool will not know the identity of the subject of the
report; a blank line is used wherever the name is to-
appear to be filled in by hand by the case officer after
the document comes back from the typist.

- On the basis of references to LANGELLE and POPOV,
this plan (which is not dated) would have to have been
drafted sometime after October 1959. WINTERS by this
time had been in Moscow since August 1958, had been de-
tected in operational letter-mailing, and had been
associating with KGB officers, etc. Neither this

operational plan nor any other of the drafts included in
the CHEREPAYOV package cited a KG3 cryptonym for hia, and
he is always referred to 1n true name, but this is contrary
to the usage in the other operational plans in the package.
It ts also contrary to KGB practice, as described by NOSEI-
KO and other sources.

- The draft cited several technical aids to be used in
the clandestine study of WINTERS. It not only gives the KGB
eryptonym of metka and “Néptun-80* for two of these techni-
ques, but immediately thereafter explains for what purpose
each one of them is used. In the other operational plans
from CHEREPANOV, and in conformance with the established
KGB practice of inserting cryotonvms for such devices,
these preparations are not only not described, but the
blan& line typed by the typist has been filled in by hand
after typing.

In addition to the above points of form, this same document
contains statements which run counter to rigid KGB prectice and
which are internally contradictory, especially noteworthy in an
approved draft. One of the objectives announced in the plan is
to investigate two Soviet citizens who were detected in contact
with WINTERS in Moscow; one of the two is identified parenthetic-
ally as having gone abroad. This document, if genuine, would be
an admission on the part of the case officer, and an epproval
thereof by his supervisor, that a Soviet citizen wno had been
observed in contact with an identified officer of Anerican Intel-
ligence had been cleared by the KGB for travel abroad before the
nature of that contact had been satisfactorily determined by the
KGB. This is in contradiction to all available information con-
cerning KGB travel clearances, which are denied on the basis of
unauthorized contacts between Soviet citizens and foreigners in
the Soviet Union, not to mention Western Intelligence officers.
The draft, which consists of only three paragraphs, can be sum-
marized briefly by paragraph to demonstrate the anternal contra-
dictions: .

- To establish the nature of WINTERS' intelligence
activities in the USSR, six special tasks will be carried
out, including round-the-clock surveillance, metka,
“Neptun-80," hidden microphones, other. audio-devices.
and investigation of already identified Soviet citizens.

- Because he already been identified as an intelli-
gence operator, and he has a hostile attitude toward the
USSR, there is no basis for recruitment; therefore the
actions outlined in the first paragraph will not be
carried out because they might alarm him and cause hin:
to leave the USSR prematurely.

- Despite the statements of the second paragraph,
which indicate that recruitment is out of the question
and which precludes putting into effect the measures
outlined in the first paragraph. this third paragraph
sets forth the expectation that just before WINTERS’.
scheduled departure and depending on further accumula-
tion of materials on WINTERS: ard the prevailing pclit-
ical climate # the time, an opportunity 1s likely to
arise which will permit testing the possibility of
recruiting him.

If the WINTERS) operation plan were a draft like the others in
this collection, the atove conflicting and confusing paragraphs
might be explained as variations jotted down as possible ap- -
proaches to presenting a4 plan for the future, as ye* undecided i
in direction. This document, however, is the one which--to |
NOSENKO's puzzlement--had been approved end signed in draft by :
KOVSHUK, as Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, fmerican Depart- :
ment, KGB Second Chief Directorate. The preparing case officer,
KUSKOV, had furthermore indicated to the typing pool that it was
to be typed in one copy, which gives the document the appearance
of a draft which had been or wags about to be made a matter of
official KGB record.

The foregoing review of errors, contradictions, and dis-
regard for security considerations in preparation constitutes
evidence that this is not a Genuine KGB draft cocument.

(4ii) Tie Summary on LANSELLE

A second document, a handwritten note in what NOSENKO
identified as CHEREPAYOV’s own handwriting, alse is pertinent
to the authenticity of the papers and of NOSENKO's account on
CHEREPANOV, This is a short summary Of the operational activity
of the CIA officer LANGELLE, covering the compromise of POFOV.
The document says in part: "In January 1959 a letter with secret
writing mailed by a co-worker of the Embassy of the USA in Moscow,
WINTERS, was intercepted and was addressed to a Sovict citizen,
POPOV, a worker of the General Staff of the Soviet Army. Accord-
ing to the contents of the letter, it was clearly established
that POPOV was an Averican agent...”

This coincides precisely with NOSENKO's accourt of POPOV's
compromise (see Pages 532 and 663}. Unlike GOLITSYN's recollec-
tion of the official report which he read, there is no reference
in this document to che report of about 1957 from an agent source
that there was a leak of GRU information; nor is there reference
to the indication that the KGS knew that LANGELLE had been posted
to Moscow in order to nandle a special agent, for this reason
placing LANGELLE under heavy surveillance. If botk of these
items were in the official report which GOLITSYN read, their
omission from the sumaary report in what purports to be CHERE-
PANOV's handwriting is noteworthy, particularly since CHEREPANOV
was supposed to have been in the same office {room) as the case
officer working against LANGELLE during the time the LANGELLE/
POPOV cperation was investigated by the KGE. The latter posi-
tion should lend authority to CHEREPANOV's version of the com-
promise and termination of the case; yet GOLITSYN--informed
only from the official, and presumably sanitized, account--had
more detail, as well as conflicting information, on the same
case. While it is reasonable that a sanitized case summary
would conceal an agent source of a lead by imputing the dis-
covery to surveillance, it seems less likely, and@ indeec un-
necessary, to conceal a detection via surveillance by imputing
it to an agent source. In thus supporting NOSENKO ard others
as to the cause of PUPOV's compromise, and contradicting
GOLITSYN (who is supported by other evidence accumulated in-
dependently), this cocument too appears to be a KGB fabrica-
tion. : -

The authenticity of another passage in the sane document is

likewise open to question. This is the description of LANGELLE's
two visits to Lenin Hills, which the documents stated were for

emer a nen nner anne aetna ee mm

the purposes of casing & drop site end putting down the dead
drop, respectively. The document further stated that the dead
drop had been put down for REPNIKOV, an agent of Anericen Intel-
ligence who had recently been arrested hy the Moscow KGB. Two
errors of fact in this passage belie KGB practice as known from
meny sources?

- There is no reason to doubt that the KGB observed \
LANGELLE on the two occasions of his visits to Lenin Hills,
both times to case a proposed dead cron site. oth sites
involved staircases, but they were two different stair-
cases in the same general area of the Lenin Hills park.
Since it is a fact that LANGELLE did not put down a dead :
Grop on either occasion. KGB survetllance could not have S
geen him do so. If the KGB had reason to suspect that he .
had done so, but could not locate it (since it was not
there). the KGB would feel the necessity--even more than
in the case of ABIDIAN and the Pushkin Street drop--to put
24-hour surveillance on the area for a reasonable length
of time, in order to apprehend the agent for whom it was
intended. The dead drop was not actually put down until
7 June 1958 (during twilight), ten days after the second
casing. Assuming the KGB had not stepped its coverage
of the area after only ten days, the CIA agent who did
put down the dead drop must have been observed doing this.
CHEREPANOV's note thus erred by ettribating to LANGELLE
an action which the KGB knew he had not taken and which
the KGB almost certainly knew someone else had taken.

i

one

- At the time the dead drop was put down, it had not :
been Gesignated for any agent. REPNIKOV included. It i {
was a contingency dead drop, to be activated at some
time in the future as necessary; the agent for whom it
might have been designated could conceivably not even
be recruited until long after the dead drop was loaded.
REPNIKOV, identified in the document as the person in-
tended to unload it, was not a recruited agent of Ameri-
can Intelligence either at the time of the drop-loading ,
or at any time thereafter? neither was any cead drop
contemplated for him in the event that he might be re- /
cruited. Nothing that wes in the drop could have sug-
gested REPHIKOV as the intended recipiert. Again,
CGHEREPANOV's note erroneously and groundlessly assigned

° the dead drop to REPNIKOV whereas in fact this dead drop
was unassigned by CIA. :

If this document were or purported to be the official
version of the activities of LANGELLE, in typed or printed
form, these errors in fact could be interpreted as intentional
and part of the sanitization, or part of an effort to make the
KGB investigative work look better than it was. As it isa
handwritten copy, supposedly in the writing of. the person who
intended to give the document to the U.S. Government and harm
the KGB, and since CHEREPANOV supposedly would have had access
i to the true facts, the absence of some comment further indi- !
4 cates that the document was intentionally inaccurate and in- :
i . complete.

(iv) Remarks

That at least two of the documents were not authentic is
evidence that the CHEREPANOV papers were designed by the KGB
for American Intelligence consumption. oe,

There is no sensitive information contained in any of the
documents; that is, they are not worth the risk of stealing
either in helping the West or damaging the KGB. It is further
questionable how CHEREPANOV was able to steal drafts destined
for destruction which are dated August 1958, March 1959, and so
on, if he had not acquired his motivation of bitterness against
the KGB until 1961, as indicated by NOSENKO and other sources.

It is also possible to question numerous other aspects of the
CHEREFANOV case, some dating from the eariiest known history of
the man and others more recent. This seems unnecessary in view
of the analysis of the WINTERS ‘document and the LANGELLE summary.

It follows that the CHEREPANOV incident was a’ provocative
plan of the KGB. NOSENKO's story about CHEREPANOV, a mutually
confirming source on KGB affairs, must be interpreted as an
indication that he has deliberately lied in reporting on the
CHEREPANOV case and his part in the investigation, now shown
to have been spurious. He has also lied in attesting to the
validity of the CHEREPANOV documents and thereby to the validity
of his own information on the same topics which those documents
also covered.

C. Evaluation of Sourcina
1. Llatroducticn

NOSENKO was able to provide Yogical and plausible sourcing
for most of his Aierican leads, through his claimed professional
assignments. Asong his foreign leads, these to which he haz no
plausible direct access have been various!y sourced to hearsay
from case officer friends (as with VASSALL, from nis friend
CHURANOV) and invoiverent in peripheral ivities u
TDY to the city of Vizdinir after the Say
had been spotted as 1 hemosexual during a visit’
able sourcing by NOSENKO has occurred in his stat
one couble agent case, four american cases and three involving
foreigners. They are reviewed below because they include the
most important leads NOSENKO has provided.

2. Discussion

There are two KGB Secon! Chief Directorate operations in-
volving imericzas which NOSERKO has sourced inconsistently or
falsely.

He demunstrated uncertainty in his knowledse cf the facts
of the “ANDRKEY” case (Pages 413-426) by making vegue allusions
to having heard of it in “bits and pieces” from a sunber of case
officers involved in the case at different t-nes; his first know-
ledge of it, he said, was due to his own evtployment in the U.S.
Embassy Section in 1953-1955, “although I worked there quite a
bit later. But it wes kncwn." (In 1962 he repeatedly dated the
recruitment as #1949-50.") . Dayle SMITH, identified as "ANDPEY",
fixed his recruitment date around December 1953, und he did not
Jeave Moscow until April 1954. Since SMITH was directly sub-
ordinate to the office of the Army Attache, which was responsible
for the Embassy's code roon, NOSENKO as case cfficer for the Army
Attaches had a lcgical reason for knowing rore than he claimed
about the case, including the agent's name. MULE, who succecded
VAN LAETHEM as ‘cryptographic security officer and SMITH's super
visor, was supposed to be one of NCSENKO's more active cases at
this time. It is clear from NOSENKO's inability to claim direct
knowledge of the case that he was not aware of these, facts.

In the case of Edward Ellis SMITH (Pages 468-469), the U.S.
Embassy Security Officer from 1954 to 1455, NOSENKO’s ignorance
of the objective facts cf the case led him into statements con~
cerning his cwn knowledge of the case which cannot be true. IA
1962 he claimed to have played a significant role in the attempt
to recruit SMITH, but he admitted after the defection that these
claims were exaggerations designed to make him lock Detter than
he was at the time. He saia the case officer was KOVSHUK, and
GRIBANOV was personally running the operation, but that ina
sense he did play 2 role; he was assigned to a phone watch in
support of surveillance during the final phase of the case. Once
again it is clear that he did not know tre dates of SMITH'S
assignment to Moscow (1954 to 1956) ner did he know that the
operation he has described tock place between 1} and 5 June 1956,
and that SMITH was recailed from Moscow on @ June i956. This is
a full year after NOSENKO gaid he transferred from the U.S. Lmbassy
Section. oo

NOSENKO claiatd to have fad a direct role ag the surervisirg

‘case officer in the BELITSKIY case in its 31962 Geneva phase. As
:g first-hand source, however, he was wrorg about the origina of
“the operation and ignorant of the content and the operational plas-

ning of the 1962 reetings he was supposedly supervising. Ia this

‘instance, as in the Edward SUITH case, NOSENKO's information ‘8
inadequate for his sourcing.

-NOSENKO provided leads to nine KGS operations which had orig-

. dnated with the First Chief Directorate. £1x of these he clained

to have learned atout through his friend in that Directorate, Gk.
who was personally tnvolved in most of these oprrat:ons.* Of the
other three, two--the Paris agent (JCUNSON) and the Brussels/NATO
cage--ne said he picked up in bits and pieces from technicians of
the Second Chie! Directorate's Spccial Section who had assisted tn
them. For both of the latter operations, nuxerous coincidences
were alleged by MOSENKO to have enabled hin to obtain the fragaen-
tary ipfornmation froa his sub-sources, and he was never able to
clarify what parts he learned from which cf the four technicians
be named as sub-sources.

In describing his acquisition of informaton on the riath
case, "SASHA," NOSENXO has contradicted hinself: He first said he
had learned sbout “SASHA" from SHA! YAPIN, providing lergthy and
dpvolved explanations of how he vecane acquainted with SHALYAPIN
at the time of the latter's retirement from the KGB in 1962. cater,
under interrogation, NOSENKO did not recell his statenents that
ERASLYAPIN was the original source of the “SSSHA" story, first
attributing it to others and later saying that he could not réxem-
ber wher and from whos he first heard it, but SHALYAPIN and others
had talked about it. This was despite the fact that by the time
he heard of "SASHA" he had already met and agreed to cooperate
with CIA; furtherfore, when asked if "SASHA" was an important lead,
ne agreed that it was a serious matter. Except for this one
occasion he had consistently failed tu appreciate the significance
of such-a lead, indicating that it was nut considered importast ina
the. KGB.

“Also casting doubt on his sourcing of “SASHA” is the fact
that; in his first reference to “SASHA” and the Cuhan missile crisis
of Cctcber 1962, NOSENKO said he had learred of this item fron
SHALYAPIX, whereas later he said it was rot from SHALYAPIN (but he
fea) not identify a:other source froa whom’ he had heard this de-
tail).

M@the RCMP's

BOSENKO first saad s friend CUK had told hin of the case un—
officialiy, GUX having been involved ic the operation in Soscow.
When asked why GUK should be involved in a Caradian case in 1963
when he was supposedly working in the First Chicf Directorate'’s
American Department against Anerican targets, NOSENKO. retracted
his initial statesest and said that GUX somehow got in contact
with hin, not as a KGB officer but sinply as an acquaintance.

and the Second Chief Directorate's Tourist Lepartoeat, to prevent

any slippage (such as NOSENSO descrited in the S:U3IN case, when

the CRU failed to ccordinate with the KuP). Yes despite logical i

3. Remarks

NOSENKO's errors concerning "ANDRIY" (particularily his early
insistence that “ANDREY" had left Moscew years before NOSENKO en-
tered the KGB) make it impossible that NOSENKO could have learned
of the case in the way he later said he did.

NOSENKO's acccunts of how he learned cf the "Paris agent" -are
vague and vary with each telling; they also depend heavily on coin-
cidence. It is notewurthy too that he clained to have been told of
this one operation by no less than four individuals, whereas the
rest of what he learned of First Chief Directerate operations in
eleven years of KG3 service came from only two other individuals.
Furthermore, his knowledge of "SASHA" sterned from elaborate and
apparently contrived sourcing whicn he himself was unable to recon-
struct when pressed for exact details. NOSENKO's inzpility to

. give any clear and consistent account of how he heard of either the
‘Paris agent" or "SASHA" must be judged ia the Ligne of the fact that
he first heard of beth cases only just after proaising to collec
such inforzation for CIA. because these were amcag the most izpor-
tant and the most fortuitous items he ever picked up, it could eo
reasonably be expected that he would remenber how he did so, espe-
cially since only a little over a ycar elapsed until his next
neeting with Cla.

NOSENKO's sourcing for thes Ce ne SRE leads seeas

illogical and fabricated. {t also appears that NOTENKXO has given an
inaccurate version of the way in which he would have learned of
‘not an Illegal as NOSENKO indicated, but an agent).

D. Examination of NOSENKO's Intelligence Carcer
1. Introduction

What follows is an examination of NOSENKO's accounts of his
Soviet Intelligence career, beginning with the years 1951 and
1952, in the naval GRU and continuing with his 11 years in the
U.S. Embassy Section and the Tourist Departrent of the KGS Sec-
ond Chief Directorate. NOSENKO's naval service opens the dis-
cussion primarily because, according to his story, it provided
a springboard for bis entrance into the KGB in 1953 with the
rank of lieutenant.

The discussion of each period in his career has two cen-
tral topics: First, NOSENKO's own descripticn of his positions,
responsibilities, and access: and second, ar assessment of this
description from the point of view of internal consistency,
accuracy, and the commensurability of his knowledge, operational
activities, and performance with his claimed senior and respon-
sible posts with the KGB and his rise to these posts. This
assessment is based on a corparison of the information supplied
by NOSENKO with collateral information from a variety of overt,
official, defector, and clandestine sources.

NOSENKO's accounts of the various periods in his career are,
of course, cumulative in that his claimed positions and activi-
ties during one stage necessarily affect those of succeeding
periods. Insofar as possible, each period is evaluated within
itself and independently of conclusions earlier reached.

2. Naval GRU Service

a. Introduction

BO. KO's accounts* of his naval GRU service (Pages 64-77)
have teen. reviewed for their internal consistency and credibility,
and examined for accuracy against information from other sources.

b. Discussion

Briefly, the ovtlines of NOSENKO's account of his military
service are about as follows:

- He studied for the equivalent of 7th, 8th, 9th and
part of 10th school years in naval schools in Kuibyshev, Baku
and Leningrad. This would normally have nothing to co with
military service, except that NOSENKO says he took the mnili-
tary oath at the Baku School in the fall of 1943, at the
age of 16. (According to available collateral information,
the oath--feorm:! entcy into the military forces--was at no
time given before the age of 17, and never for purposes of
"show" or “morale” as NOSENKO claimed it was here.) He .
claims to have deserted this school after taking the oath.
Also, he shot himself in the hand only about two months
after starting anew later the same year in the naval school
in Leningrad and never finished school properly.

= He was comuissioned in the "reserves" in 1947 after
completing his second year at the Institute of International
Relations in Moscow. However, he cannot remember what
branch of the service he was in, except that it was not the
navy. He avoided active military duty thereafter by volun-
tarily doing military translations at the Institute. While
at the Institute he contracted venereal disease at least
twice and this went on his record.

- In the spring of 1950, he was assigned to the Navy
by a mandate commission at the Institute. However, he
failed one of his examinations ("Marxism-Leninism") upon
completicn of the Institute of International Relations later
in 1950 which delayed his ciploma--and hence entry into
the service--until successful re-examination later that
year. (At about the same time, he was considered and turned
Gown by the KGB [then 4G3] because of his school record,
drunkenness, and. other bad marks in his record.)

- He was processed for entry into the naval GRU in
1950. He said he visited the GRU personnel cffice several
times for interviews and to fill out queetionnaires and
write his personal history in connection with the required
security check. He was accepted into naval GRU ‘despite a
record which showed desertion, self-inflicted wound in

* There 1s no single account of this period of NOSENKO's life
which can be examined because NOSENKO has altered the cir-
_eumstances and dates importantly from one telling to the next.

wartime, deurkenness, venereal cisease, still-valid marriage
to a State criminal's daughter, rejection for MGB employ-
ment, and a bad academic record including failure of a
course in Marxism-Leninism just at thie time.

- He was called to active duty as a senior lieutenant
on 12 Marcn 1951, and without any indoctrination cr train-
ing, he departed four or five days later in civilian clothes
for his firset duty station, Sovietskaya Gavan in the Soviet

Far East. SOSENKO claims to lave chosen this post, con~ f
sidered generally to be the least desirable of all naval

assignments, on his own initiative, to prove to his father

that ne won a man, (The above was his account in 1966, in

all earlier accounts he said he went to the Soviet Far East

in the fall of 1950, and in fact said that he had two months’
leave in 1952, one for each of two years there. However,

according to the 1956 account, his service there lasted only i
one year.) {

- In fovetskaya Gavan KOSEKKO's job was to extract in- j
formation froa American publications reporting naval de-
velopments, Asked in April 1564 for any personal account i
of his own work, HOSENKO was able to think of oniy “four or :
five trips® on small ships to the coast of Sakhalin,* and
three to H.ukxaido, to drop or pick up agents. His own role,
he said, was as a trainee; he was taken along oniy "to iearn
how it was done;" he himself never trained or dispatched any
agents, nor did he know the identities cr missions cf any
others. is also could not descrite the ships he had travelled
: on. Questioned on the location of Sovetskaya Gavan’ in 1965,
. : NOSENKO inaisted that this city is lccated in Primorskiy
Kray, although it is actually located in Khabarovskiy Kray.**

- NOSENKO said he returned on routine leave (or, accord-
ing to otter accounts, because of having contracted tubercu-
losis) in April 1952. He then spent two months either in
his parents’ Moscow home or, according to other accounts, in
a sanitorium near Mescow under treatment for tuberculosis.

He said he was coughing up “half a glass of biood at a time.”
(X-rays and medical examinations from February 1964 have

- detected no indicaticns that NOSENKO ever suffered from

‘ tuberculosis.)

; = At this time, the summer of 1952, NOSENKO said he was
' offered in Yoscow an opportunity to attend the GRU strategic
i intelligence school, the Military-Diplomatic Academy, but
turned it down because he had already studied most of the
course matter in the Institute of International Affairs; ba-
sides, NOSENKO said in October 1966, he failed the physical
examinaticn when sugar was discovered in his faeces.

enema —tmemapreapimtee

.7 NOSENKO was then transferred--without returning to
the Far East--to the Intelligence Staff of the Baltic Fleet
_at Baltiysz. He invented a story in 1964 about going there

¥ In October T5S6 HOSENKO was asked whether he had ever been
to Sakhalin; his ansver was no. .

land, Oregon and thinking oneself in California.

via Naval Intelligence Points in Berlin, Rostock, and Sass-
nitz, but then said this was a lie he told because he felt

his interrogators would not believe him if ne had said he
successfully turned down an assignzent to these points,

then closing down, and hed travelled directly to Baltiysk.

(As pointed out to NOSENKO, the assignment to the cold,

damp Baltic climate of a recent ‘T8-sufferer appears unthink=
able, particularly when that person is a Government Minister's
gon; he acknowledged this but said, “There were no other
positions available.")

~ He could not remember the name of the place he served
near Raltiysk. He had named it as Primorsk in 1962 (which
fitted his description of its size and location) but from
1964 on insisted it was Sovetsk. There is no such village
in the area, but there is in the region a well-known city
by that name (the former Tilsit) far inland and far away.
He did not know (as contemporary Soviet maps show) that
a rail line went to Baltiysk from Primorsk.

- In the Baltiysk area, he claimed in 1962, he had
trained agent teams to be sent behind enemy lines in time of
war. Under interrogation in 1964 he changed his description
of his functions, saying he merely prepared training mater-
jals and delivered supplies, never having direct contact with
or knowledge of the agent work. His service there was
limited to about six months, since he said he left there at
the beginning of 1953. He either had had cne or two leaves
from there, depending on which telling is accepted: In 1964
NOSENKO said that in August or September 1952 he was given
a special leave from his duties in Sovetsk to travel to Mos-
cow in order to formalize his civorce from his first wife;
in April 1966 he wrote that he was divorced during his leave
before going to Sovetsk.

= NOSENKO said he returned to Moscow on his own initia-
tive and against the wishes of nis commanding officer at the
end of 1952 and began steps to get out of the GRU. He has
told conflicting stories of where he stayed and in what
leave status. It was during this period, he said, that
his conversation with KOBULOV led him to shift to the KGB.

- In April 1966 NOSENKO wrote that he was promoted to
the rank of lieutenant of the Administrative Services while
stationed in Sovetsk. In earlier accounts he said that he
was promoted to the rank of lieutenant while stationed in
the Soviet Far East. , :

NOSENKO's accounts: Variations of dates may be attributable to
faulty memory, changes in the story might have resulted from his

ny to ail availawle information, not have been accepted
into the naval GRU, one of the particularly sensitive parts

of the navy. Either the life history is false, or the GR’}
officer Service ds, or both.

(z) Ine story is vague, unsubstantial, and contra~-
dictory; no substance has been added to the base outlines
of the story despite frequent questioning. One might expec”
of an educated or reasonably intelligent person some recol-
jection of military service completed 10 years earlier--the
locations whece he served, whether he did or did not have
TB, how and when he entered or transferred from one place to
another, and what he did or what he experienced,

(3) NOSENKO's knowledge of military procedures, of
the navy, and of the units with which he served is practic-
ally non-exiztent. He has provided no reason whatever to
make one believe that he actually was a naval officer.

(4) The functions he claims to have fui filled involved
no direst invoivement or persona responeibilities: They
sound like the bare outlines of a legend, not like real life
or personal experience.

That this period is fictitious is supported by the findings
of the psychologist (Pages 665-611).

NOSENKO's description of his naval GPU service cannot be
accepted as true. On the basis of his statements, it appears
moreover that he was never a naval officer, nor an officer of any
other regular military service.

Since NOSFNKO clains that his GRU status and service provided
him the platform for.a transfer into the KGB (without such for-
malities as medical examination, personnel interviews or question-
naires), this conclusion is relevant to his claim of KGB staff
status from 1952 or 1953. oO

3. Entry into the KGB
a. Eligibility

The previous section discussed NOSENKO'S eligibility for
admission to the naval GRU and concluded with the remark that,
on the basis of what NOSENKO has tc!d CIA about his earlier

‘life, he could not have been accepted for service in Naval

Intelligence, According to information available to CIA from
several knowledgeable sources, the GR has more stringent entry
requirements than any other Soviet organization. The candidate's
family background, personal conduct. and Party or Komsomol rec-
ord must be impeccable. NOSENKO would have American Intelli-
gence believe that in his case the KG8--specifically the offi-
cers responsible for signing their names to tie approval-~accepted
a person whose record showed (a3 noted on pages 679-680 above)
desertion from the armed forces, self-inflicted wound in wartime,
drunkenness, venereal disease, previcus » Triage tc the dauenter

itself. Ine cnty trange since the earlier rejection had been,

@Ccording to NOSENKO, two years of undistinguished military ser-
vice in the Naval GRU. aa
veces 3 OS

Moreover, during this naval duty NOSENKO said he had con~
tracted tuberculosis, for which he was still under treatment
at the €ime he entered the State Security Service. NOSENKO has
indicated 7n separate occasions that his illness was a matter

_ Of record with the GRU, and that the reason he did not have to

take a physical examination for entry into the KGB was the avail-~
ability of GRU records. According to CERYABIN, however, KGB
regulations at that time would have precluded admission to KGB
ranks if there was a recent history of tuberculosis even though
already arrested.

b. Date of Entry .

NOSERKO has given a variety of dates for his entry on duty
with the KGB and has provided severa! reasons for his changes of
story (Pages 36-89). During his first zeeting with CIA, when
NOSENKO gave a brief personal anc proZessional autobiography, he
said that he had joined the KGB in February or March 1953. In
1964, however, first while still ettached to the Soviet Disarma~
ment Delegation and later when reviewing and signing a bio-
graphic history prepared by CIA on the basis of his own account,
NOSENKO set this date back a year, to early 1952. During the
interrogations of April 1964, after naming several other dates,
NOSENKO returned to the original one, March 1953, and has remained
with this version since that time. NOSENKO has given two dif-
ferent reasons for this change of dates (which, he said in Octo-
ber 1966, was conscious deception). In the April 1964 interrogations,
he explained that he had failed his examination in Marxism-Leninism
at the Institute of International Affairs, which forced hin to
take all his exams over again and celayed his career: This was
*unpleasant,* NOSENKO said, and he was attempting to conceal it
from CIA. In the October 1956 interrogations, NOSENKO gave a new
and different reason. He described how he had been rejected for
employment by State Security while at the Institute and was trying
to cover up for this because he thought CIA would not believe
that he had first been rejected and then, later, accepted by the KGB.

NOSENKO's change of story tock place in 1964 while still in the
relatively relaxed circumstances of an operational meeting in
Geneva; he came back to his original account only during the
April 1964 interrogations. NOSENKO's explanations of why he re-
vised the story have been inconsistent and have forced him into

further inconsistencies. Because of this and, in the absence of
any pressure of any kind (including any apparent psychological
pressure) to lie about his date of entry, the most logical explana-
tion for this change is that NOSENKO forgot in early 1364 either
when Ke joined the KGB and/or what he had told CIA in 1952.
DERYABIN has commented on the significance which the date of entry
holds for a KGB officer. He expressed the opinion that it would
be unusual] for a KGB officer to forget this date.

NOSENKO was cuestioned at length by DERYABIN (Pages 616-619)
concerning the tizing of his entry on duty with the KGe. As a
result of this interrogation it was determined that NOSENKO was
unaware that at the time he said he joined the KGB, the present
First Chief Directorate was designated the Second Chief Direc-
torate and vice versa. Therefore, NOSENSO would have joined a
component entitled the First Chief Directorate in March 1953,
not the Second Chicf Directorate as he says. NOSENKO did not
know or had forgotten various other facts, including the date
that the MVD was redesignated the KoB, and misstated the loca-
tions and existence of various buiidings and offices in the
vicinity of the KGB Headquarters building in early 1953.

Ir, June 1962 NOSENKO said several times, in different meet-
ings, that the KGB agent “ANDREY" (Pages 413-414) had been re-
eruited and had left Moscow before he, “OSENKO, entered the KGB.
Me estimated the date as 1449-1950. NOSENKO knew that “ANDPEY®
was associated in Moscow with RiODES and when told that RHODES
was there from 1951 to 1953, admitted that the date he gave might
be wrong. NOSENKO continued to say, however, that “ANDREY" was
recruited before he (NOSEUKO) became a KS8 officer, and later
reverted again to his estimate that “ANDRE1" was recruited in
1949-1950. Wher he returned to Geneva in 1964, NOSENKO changed
this story and said that during his 1953-1955 tour in the U.S.
Embassy Section he saw cipher specialist SELEZNOV, who had come
there to consult on the then-active "ANDREY" case. NOSENKO was
unable to explain how he could have been sure in 1962 that the
"ANDREY® case was before nis time) when ne said in 1964 that
this was not so. Dayle SMITH confessed that he was recruited by
the KGB in late 1953, and records show that he left Moscow in
early 1954.

ec. Circurstances of Entry

NOSENKO has consistently related his entrance into the KGB
to discussions he had with General KOBULOV in early 1953 in Mcs-
cow, after returning from the Baltic. However, he has changed the
date of these discussions with KOBULOV virtually every time he
has told this story. In June 1962, NOSENKO said he talked with
KOBULOV at the NOSENKO dacha while on leave in March 1963; during
the April 1964 interrogations he changed the date to February
1953; in April 1965 KOSENKO said he spoke to KOBULOV at the
KOBULOV dacha in January 1953 while on leave and that he lived
at home and was at the "disposal of GRU personnel” during Febru-
ary and March. Finally, in April 1966, NOSENKO said he first
spoke to KOBULOV at KO3ULOV's dacha on New Years Day 1953, that
he was subsequently "resting" at a sanitorium connected with his
tuberculosis of the year before, and that he spoke again to

_KOBULOV cr. the day of STALIN's funeral, while home for a few days

from the sanitorium. It was at this second encounter with KOBLLOV
that the letter promised to concern himself with NOSENKO's entry
into the KGB. :

VP.

In 1962 NOSENKO described the simple procedure by which he
entered the KG3, volunteering that there was no need to fil! out
a questionnaire (anxeta) as the KGB already had his files from
the GRU. In Apri when asked if he had not been required
to fill out any questionnaires or other docutents, NOSENKO ces-
cribed the anketa and other forms he completed (saying he took
them home to do 50) and his various interviews with KGB per-
sonnel officers. He was interrogated in detail on these claims
by DERYABIN in 1965, to whom he gave descriptions, albeit in-
accurate, of the varicus forms and of his visits to KGB Personnel.
In 1966 NCSENKO wrote in his autobiography that there were no
talks with KGB Personnel before or after his acceptance and in-
plied that there were no forms to fill out. :

dad. Remarks

According to all of NOSENKO's stories, his GRU service was
the springboard for his acceptance into the KGB. He met KOBULOV
while hore in Moscow from Primorsk/Sovetsk, he enterec the KG3
as a lieutenant since this was his naval rank, his admission
according to the early version was facilitated by the availability
of his GRU personnel file; yet CIA has concluded that NOSENKO
was never a GRU officer and it appears highly improbable that he
waa ever in Primorsk under any circumstances.

On the basis of generally available information concerning
Sovict realities at the time of NOSENKO's claimed entry into the
¥GB, supported by the expert testimony of DERYABIN (wno was in
the KGB, then MVD, in Moscow at tha time and hed been himself a
KGB personnel officer until less than a year earlier), a person
with the background NOSENKO has given could not be accepted into
the KGB in the manner he claims. His health alone would seem
to have precluded this, but in addition, NOSENKO described a
series of incidents in his life equally likely to cause rejection.
NOSENKO's mistakes, changes of story, and apparent fabrications
add to the unlikelihood of his account.

It is concluded that, as in the case of NOSENKO's GRU ser-
vice, either NOSENKO and those’ who have supported aspects of
his story have seriously distorted his past life, or he did not

enter the KGB.

4. Initial Service in the U.S. Embassy Section

a. Introduction

NOSENKO claims to have served in the U.S. Fmbassy Section of i
the American Department, Second Chief Directorate, during the
period-from his entry on duty with the ¥GB until June 1955. His
targets during these two years were at first American correspond-
ents in Moscow and later American Army Attaches at.the Embassy.

NOSENKO sought to avoid discussion cf his o«wn:or:other KGB
activity during this period and on occasion he has tried to dis-
miss the whole period as “not relevant” and “of ne conseauence.”
NOSENKO has repeatedly said that he “found himself” only after his
initial service in the U.S. Embassy Section, (He varicusly dated
his self-discovery as occurring in 1955, wnen he transferred to
the Tourist Department: in June 1956, in connection with his par-
ticipation in and award for the BURGI case; ana after sust 1956,
when the death of his father forced him to pull himseis together.)
Before this, KOSENKO said, he was a wastrel and “did not pay
attention to the work.”

b. Work Against American Correspondents

NOSENKO exempted himself from reporting details of KGB work
against any specific American correspondent in Moscow in 1953-
1954 (Pages 93-96) by saying that, as a new, very junior employee
he had no access to operational files and did not participate
personally in the handling of any of the correspondents. Although
able to iGentify four correspondents in Moscow who were then re-
eruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this information either in
conversations with his superior KOZLOV or at some point and in
gome undefined way after he no longer was working against these
targets. NOSENKO's early months in the job were spent reading
personality (not operational) files on a number of the corres-
pondents in Moscow (none of which indicated the individual's de-
velopmental or agent status) and familiarizing himself with KGB
methods. Later NOSENKO was assigned the “agent network" of
drivers, clerical personnel, and domestics surrounding four. of
the correspondents (two of whom were recruited ¥G5 agents at
the time); he met with them periodicaily to determine whether
they had. developed any important information. Even here, however,
NOSENKO appears to have been given very little responsibility:

His superior KOZLOV often went along to the meetings with NCSENKO,
first to show him how to handle the agents and afterward when-
ever something interesting would begin to develop. In fact,
according to NOSENKO, KOZLOV would accompany him to meetings

with these Soviet citizens-agents even when there was a *hint"
that something of interest might develop. NOSENKO has been able
to identify some of these agents, but for all but a few he re-
called neither their names nor personalia concerning them.

ce. Work Against Army Attaches

Regarding NOSENKO's work against American Army Attaches, he
claimed a specific area of KGB responsibility, one for which he
alone was accountable and one about which something was previously
known from U.S. records. Only 20 months at the longest, it is

the last period in which NOSENKO had no supervisory responsibility

. to divert hig attention from personal operational duties.

NOSENKO could not resember when he tous over responsibility
for the Army Attsches, and he named two other KGB officers before
settling upon BUDYLDIN as the person from whom he received the
Attaches' files. Yhen belittling his earlier responsibilities
for correspondents, he has said several times that he had heen in
that job “only about six months." Assuming that NOSENKO entered
the KGB in the middle of March 1953, this would date his transfer
to work against the Attaches in the fall of that year. In dis-
cussing this transfer itself, however, NOSENKO has consistently
said that it took place in 1954. Asked when in 1954, NOSENKO
bas variously replied "at the beginning of 1954," January 1954,
and Mey 1954. Under interrogation in early 1965, NOSENKO re-
fused to estimate when he took over this responsibility. He has
always said that he turned over these duties and transferred from
the U.S. Embassy Section in June 1955, when the Tourist Department
was established within the Second Chief Directorate. :

NOSENKO has said in different contexts that as the American
Department case officer responsible for cperations against the
U.S. Army Attaches he received and ‘was responsible for assinilat-
ing the product of a wide variety of gources on the indivicuals
who were his targets. He has mentioned information received fron
the KGB First Chief (Foreign Intelligence) Directorate; the
Archives of the MGB/MVD/KGB; micropiiones which were explaced
about a year before NOSENKO entered the American Department*; a
network of Soviet chauffeurs, cooks, language instructors, and
other agents in the Enbassy who together provided little useful
information; permanent and roving surveillance patrois outside
the Embassy; fixed observation posts next to, across from and
near the Embassy; advance notification of intent to travel by
the Attaches and their itineraries; and reports from outside Mos-
cow, including surveillance, egent networks, the Militia, and the
military. The point of collecting and assimilating this infor-
mation, NOSENKO said, was to be able to know what the Attaches
were doing in Moscow ard thereby to control their intelligence
collection activities. Far less important was the goal of re-
ecruiting Military Attaches; NOSENKO knew of only several in-
stances when this was attempted, and all of these efforts failed.

The KGB’s principal interest in control rather than recruit-
went has been NOSENKO's explanation for knowing little about the
backgrounds ard personal lives of his targets--such information,
he stated, simply was not pertinent to the primary mission of

*On some occasions NOSEXKO has said that the microphones in the
Army Attache offices were his most valuable source of informa-
tion on his targets of 1954-1955; at other times he has said

that he knew nothing of these microphones until he reentered the
U.S, Embassy Section in 1960; and at still other times he claimed
to have known only of their existence during 1953-1955 but not

where any were located.

control.* He has also usec this-expianaticn to support his claim
that there were no recruitments of ailitary attaches during this
period. :

“An exception, wherein the KGB ‘did carefully compiie a great
deal of vulnerability data on an Army Attache, was described by
NOSENKO in connection with the approach to Walter MULE (Page 104).
On the basis of these expianations, NOSENKO's knowledge of the
official and unofficial activities of his alleged targets in this
period deserves attention.

NOSENKO knew almost. nothing about the personal backgrounds
and families of the éight members of the Army Attache Office
whom he identified as his targets (Pages 99-106). Although he was
able to identify each by rank and position in the "nbassy--some-
times inaccurately--and in a few cases to Gescribe certain of
their operational activities, he was unaware of or had forgotten
such facts as:

~ Colonel Earl L. MICKELSON, the Army Attache in 1934
and 1955, was arrested twice Ly the Militia outsice of Mos-
cow in 1954.

- Assistant Army Attache Ira RICHARDS was a language
student of GROMOKOVA (identified by NOSENKO as a KGB egent);
by RICHARDS' account she sought to elicit biographic data
from him curing the lessons.

- William STROUD, the Assistant Army Attache, travelled
to Kharkov in May 1955 to interivew an American defectcr.
(NOSENKO has identified Frank SISCOE, who accompanied STROUD,
as a suspected CIA officer; he was coopted by CIA.)

NOSENKO, furthermore, was ignorant of important events, known
independently to CIA, which were within the sphere of what he
claimed was his direct, personal responsibility:

~ NOSENKO claimed direct personal responsibility for
the file of and operational activity against Lieutenant
Colonel Howard FELCHLIN (Pages 191-103). He claimed to be
receiving agent information on him but could not recall the
names or cryptonyms of any such agents. (ie said, for
example: “I think FELCHLiN must have had a maid, and she
would have been a KGB agent.") NOSENKO described FELCHLIN
as by far the most aggressive of his targets and hence the
object of special interest; yet he did not know or remember

¥OSENKO himself, when giving the reason why he did not know
more details about the U.S. Embassy Section's targets while
he was its Deputy Chief in 19€0-1961, said that as a supervisor
he was too busy overseeing subordinates; hence,. NOSENKO con-
tinued, he could not be expected to remember as many such de~
tails as would be possible had he been a case officer working
daily with only four or five files. In another context, NOSENKO
explained why he was unable to supply the details of planning
and organizing operations against tourists in the period 1955-
1959; he contrasted operations acainst tourists, who often
cane and went in a matter of a few days, to the work against
the Military Attaches and diplozats stationed in Moscow on .
permanent assignments, who could be studied systematically and
slowly.

anything about FELCHLIN's background, presutably well docu-
mented by the KGB beccuse FELCHLIN had been to the USSR in
two different capacities, merchant seaman and diplomatic
courier, prior to arriving in Moscow as the Assistant Army
Attache; also FELCHLIN had had prior official association
with GRU officers in Austria, Germany, and the United States,
and he continued to be in liaison with one of them in Moscow.
NOSENKO could recall nothing about FELCHLIN's intelligence
activities in the USSR or his trips about the country, or
what had been done about them by the KGB. In speaking of
FELCHLIN's expulsion from the Soviet Union, NOSENKO reported
the KGB file noted that FELCHLIN had been caught taking
photographs on some occasion, but he did not know that FEL~
CHLIN in June 1954 was arrested in Kiev with another Assist-
ant Army Attache, F.J. YEAGER. (Erroneously identificd by
NOSENKO as an Air Force Attache, YEAGER likewise should have
been NCSENKO's target.) NOSENKO also did not know that
FELCHLIN, with another Army Attacne and two Air.Force Attaches,
in September 1953 had made an unprecedented train trip through-
out Siberia and that six months later, at the end of March
1954, had been the subject of a newspaper article which
charged that they had lost "spy documents" on the train.
NOSENKO was unable to crovide a date for FELCHLIN's expul-
sion from the Soviet Union, and ne Knew nothing of the un-
usual circumstances cf FELCHLIN's Ceparture from Moscow;
he insisted that nobody else was declared persona non grata
along with FELCHLIN., In fact, FELCHLIN was Sopetied along
with Air Force Major ‘Salter MCKINNEY, and the Soviets re-
fused to permit the two to leave Moscow aboard the Ambassa~
dor's personal plane until Ambassador BOHLEN himself protested.
Confronted by his lack of knowledge of the persona non

rata action, NOSENKO said that he could not be expected to
fnow the details because this incident occurred after he
transferred from the U.S. Embassy Section to the Tourist
Department in June 1955. NOSENKO was then told the recorded
date of the expulsion, 3 July 1954, and he replied that this
was not true.

- Discrepancies appeared in NOSENKO’s account of one
of the best kncwn incidents in the history of KGB operations
against the American officials in the Soviet Union, the
subject of reports by GOLITSYN and other CIA sources and the
subject of training saterials. This was the seizure of
sensitive technical collection equipment on 5 May 1955 in

‘Stalingrad from three Assistant Military Attaches from the
U.S. Embassy--Major John S. BENSON, Captain STROUD, and

Captain MULE--and their expulsion from the Soviet Union two
days later. NOSENKO claimed direct responsibility for KGB
work against these officers (Pages 103-105); he described

an earlier attempt to defect MULE, his own plans for seizing
this equipment at a railroad station outside Moscow, and his
role in developing plans for the successful operation in
Stalingrad. When NOSENKO was pressed under interrogation to
give the entire story of the equipment seizure-and the persona
non grata action, he said that the operation was carried out
after he was in the Tourist Department and therefore he knew
no more about it. then told that the operation took place
at. least a month before his alleged transfer, NOSENKO could
offer no explanation for his lack of knowledge.

. NOSENKO identified George VAN LAZTHEM as an Assistant
Air Attache 1n 1953 or 1954: he was a target of another U.S.
Embassy Section officer, and an unsuccessful KGB development
operation was carried out against ham. NOSENKO did not know
that VAN LASTHEM was actually an Assistant Army Attache, who
left Moscow 1n March 1953 and was succeeded by NOSENKO's own
target Walter MULE (see above). What NCSENKO additionally
did not know is that in Moscow VAN LAETHEM was the Attache
‘eryptographic security officer, the superior of Dayle SMITH
(the subject of NOSE:KO's "ANDREY" lead--see below) and a
friend of the motor pool sergeant Roy RHODES, a KGB agent.
NOSENKO furthermore did not know that on 19 March 1955,
again as en Army Attache, and only two years after being
transferred from Moscow, VAN LAETHEM:was again sent to Mos-
cow, ostensibly on a PCS assignment but actually on tempor-
ary duty. During this latter assignment, when NOSENKO by
his own account should have been responsible for him, VAN
LAETHEM was in Moscow to review the entire electronics
program at the Embassy. (VAN LAETHEM's second tour in
Moscow invelved the planned use of the electronic equipment.
which was seized in Stalingrad while VAN LAETHEM was still
in Moscow.) .

d. Additional Reporting

His information on two other operations involving Americans
was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in the U.S.
Embassy Section. One was the recruitment of the military cipher
machine mechanic having the KGB cryptonym “ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH,

‘see Pages 413-426 and further comments in Part VIII.B.3, and

VIII.C.). NOSENKO in 1962 was sure not only thet this recruit-
ment took place before he joined the KGB but that “ANDREY" had
left the USSR by then as well: he repeatedly estimated "ANDREY's"
recruitment date as "1949-1950." At all times he has claimed
certainty that “ANDRKEY" wes the last KGB recruitment in the
Embassy until the time of NOSENKO's defection in January 1964.

In 1964, however, NOSE!.KO changed his story and said “ANDREY"

was active while NOSENKO was in the U.S. Embassy Section ii. 1954-

ra

1955. The other operation was an unsuccessful recruitment approach

to the U.S. Embassy Securicy Officer Edward Ellis SMITH (see
Pages 468-469 and further comments in Part VIII.B.3. and VIII.C.
atove) at a meeting with the KGB arranged through letters which
had been sent to SMITH. This occurred in 1954 or 1955; NOSENKO
said, and in support of the recruitment approach, he handled

the surveillance phone-watch. SMITH admitted to U.S. authorities
having received four letters from the KGB between 2 and 5 June
1956 (a year after NOSENKO dated his departure from the U.S.
Embassy Section), but he denied having had any personal meetings
with KGB officers.

e. Remarks

NOSENKO's accounts of the 1953-1955 period are confused,
contradictory, and, when compared with collateral information,
incomplete and inaccurate. He has been inconsistent in dating
his shift of responsibilities within the U.S. Embassy Section,
in dating his departure from the Section (viz., the timing of
the Stalingrad incident and the approach to SMITH), and in dating
his first knowledge of the microphones 1n the Embassy. Having ~

few new details of importance on the American correspondents,
NOSENKO has proven unreliable regarding his work against Army
Attaches: He misidentified two (YEAGER and VAN LAETHEM), he
Claimed to have almost no information on the backgrounds and acti-
vities of the others; and he lacked even.the most important de-
tails on security affairs involving the majority of his eight
alleged targets. In addition, NOSENKO has told CIA almost noth-
ing about the work of his colleagues in the U.S. Embassy Section.

SR et ree Eee

: The statements by NOSENKO about this pericd therefore hold

. so little substance and the manner of his reporting was so uncon-
vincing, that his claim to have been an officer of the U.S.
Embassy Section in the years 1953-1955 cannot be true.

5. Tourist De-artment (June 1955 to January 1950)
a. Introduction

NOSENKO's activities from June 1955 to January 1960, his
first period of alleged service with the Acerican-British-Canaje
ian Secticn of Tourist Department of the KGB Second Chief Direc-
torate, are described in Pages 107-151. For the purposes of the
following digecussion, it is ccnvenient to divide this period into
two parts. The firse uf these covers the ycars from June 1955
to June 1958, when NOSENKO said ke was a staff case officer,
handling and recruiting agents and planning and managing opera-
ticnal activity. The second part covers NOSENKO's service froin
June 1953 to the beginning of 1960 as Leputy Chie! of this secticn.
Apart from his personal involvement in a nurber of recruitment
Operations in the latter pericd, it is thie service which provices
a basis for MOSENKO to Claim awarencss of «11 important arrests
of spies and recruitments from emong American tourists visiting
the Soviet Unicn; it is also this survice as Czputy Chief cf Sece
tion which NOCENxO cites as a baris for his involvement in the
case of Lee Harvey OSWALD anside the Soviet Union.

b. The Early Period (1955 to 1958)
(i) Gerezal

Recording to NOSE'NKO's story, he ves aitong the first case
efficers in the Tourist bcpartment. He arrived there just as
the Department was beiry formed and took part with other officers
assigned in the acquisition of an agent network from within
inturist, in the establishment of facilities and methods, and in
Generally “gettirg things going." Several months later he parti-
cipated in what he says was his first operation against an Ameri-
can toctrist. ‘This waa NOSENKO's Lehind-the-scenes (and hence
uncor.firmed) organization of an unseccussful attempt to compromise
Martin MALIA (Pages 112-113). NOSENKO's next case (the first
operation in which his participation is confirmed) took place a
wear later, in June 1956, when he assisted in the homosexual en-
trapment and recruitment of Richard BURGI (Pages 113-120). This
recruitment, which cccurred close in time to the Minister NOSENKO's
death, was by NOSENKO's account a turning point in his personal
and professional life. titn it, NOSENKO began to acquire a sense
of self-confidence and responsibility and began to “grow" from a
wastrel into an effective and successful KGB officer. As a re-
sult of this cperation, the first successfu. recruitment in the
then short history of the Tourist Department, NOSFNKO first came

"ante personal contact with Gencral GRIBANOV. according to ali

ccounts prior to October 1966, when he retracted the claim,
NOSENKO received the first of a series of KG3 awards for opera-~
tional performance because of the BUIGI case--a letter of con-
mendation. Within a month of this oreration, NOSENFO said, he
was promoted frsm the rank of lieutenant to captain, his last
promotion prior te defecting eight years later.

NOSENKO's direct operational activity ia the next two years,
before his appointment as Deputy Chief of the Section, was des-
eribed by WOSENXO as follows: Sometime in 1957 he was involved _

dn—-the-atterpted recruitment of the German businéssran |
(Pages 120-121); after surrounding him with agents, NOSENKO

personally spoke to him. NOSCNKO explained his (unconfirred)
participation in this case, which was not among the responsibili-
ties of his section, by sayi there was no ¥G3 cfticer available
who spoke German put was krown to speak “a little Eng-
lisa,” a language in ENKO hed fair fluency. In 1957
NOSENKO was also irvolved in the sexval and bleckmarket entrap-
ment of G@SseeNR Norwegian journalist (again, not a target of
NOSENKO's section, being neither Amecican, Lritish or Canadian):
NOSEXKO has rot explained how he cate to be involved in this
operation, but he said his role was thet of invelving SEB ith
women and blacknarzetcers so that arcther officer, ARKHIPOV, could
recruit hin. meena rot identifiec NOSENKO, but reported on
an individual whose role corresponds to the one NOSENKO claimed

as his own (Pages 121-122). NOSENAO's third operaticn in 1957

was really not an cperation at all. he was assigned to accompany
the British & nd the latter's interpreter (ge ion
a tcur of Soviet publishing houses (Page 121). NOSENKO said his
purpose was only to watch @]MEak a suspected intelligence agent
or officer. is presence was confirred by (ime who recognized
NOSENKO's photograph.

the.
This is the sum of NOSENKO's ‘reported, ecretimes verified,
operational role Curing the three years preceding his promotion
in June 1958 to the position of Ceputy Chief of the Anerican-
Canadian-British Tourist Section, hereafter referred to as the

American Teurist Section.

The onty case of the June 1955-June 1958 period resulting
in agent contacts abroad, and the o:2 to which MCSENKO ascribed .
the greatest importance, was the recruitment f BURGI. For this
reason, the BURGI operation is discussed in detail below, with
particular attention being given to those aspects of the case
which reflect upon NOSENKO's own personal role. .

(ii) The BURGI Case

NOSEXKO's statements of this operation generally agreed with
that BURGI proviced to the FBI in 1957. The part NOSENKO played
in the case, both in his brief initial presence with the two
homosexuals in the Moscow restaurant on the evening of 3URGI's

; compromise (20 June 1956) and in the #iev events (23-28 June 1956)
i would appear to be one normally taken by a KGB staff officer.

The identities of the other two KGb participants in the Kiev
recruitment, KOZLOV and PETRENKO, seem clearly establisned. There
were discrepancies between NOSENKO's and BURGi's versions, but
most of these could stem from NOSENKO's faulty mezory nine years
after the events. (Such discrepancies incluce NUSINKO's Zailure
to remember his first Moscow meetings with BURGI: the identity,
role, or even existence of the person “Anatoliy® whom BURGI says
introduced him to “OSENKO and participated in the homosexual

compromise; whether NOSENKO was at the Kiev airport to meet BURGI;
i the locaticn of NOSENKO‘s bedroom in the Kiev Hotel as compared

: to BURGI's; NOSENKO's reference to BLURGI"s "interpreter" when in

i fact BURGI neither had nor needed one; and NOSENKO's failure to i
remember the unusual circumstances of BURGI's departure from
Kiev.) Other contradicticns and omissions in NISENKO's reporting
relate to matters of greater operationai consequence:

694,

~ NOSENKO wag unable to say when or how the KGS first
learned that BURGI was a homosexual, nor could he remember
who first proposed an cperation against him.

- NOSENKO gave a confused and evasive account of his :
dealings with the Pirst Chief Directorate on this case.

~ NOSENKO insisted that there was no official file on
BURGI, and that none was opened as a result of this opera~
tion. The initiative for the operation came, he said, fron
the Second Chief Directorate, and when NCSENKO traced BURGI.
in the First Chief Directorate, there was no information on
him there.* The KGB's only information on BURGI at the
time of the compromise came from BURGI's visa: application
(which showed him to be a professor of Russian) and a few
agent reports from the preceding days in Moscow; BURGI,
on the other hand, reportec that during the recruitment‘
KOZLOV, the senior Soviet present, showed knowledge of the
names of BURGI's sister, mother and father and knew the
sister's occupation; details of BURGI's background, work, and
military service, BURGI's relations with the Russicum in
Rome, which BURGI said he had never mentioned in the USSR;
and BURGI's acquaintance in the U.S. with Alexander KERENSKY.

NOSENKO cited “his" recruitment of BURGI in Kiev in 1956 as
one of the main reasons for his rapid rise in the KGB. BURGI's >
story of the recruitment, as reported to the FBI, definitely
establishes NOSENKO's role as having been subordinate to that of
KOZLCV-~it was KOZLOV, not NOSENKO, who made the recruitment.

* DERYABIN interrogated NOSENKO on this case. NOSENKO's answers
to such detailed questions as how the traces were done, how
the travel to Kiev was arranged, details concerning the person-
nel involved, the contents of the file, and other mechanics
of the case, betrayed an almost total lack of memory.

c. Promotion to Deputy Chief of Section

NOSENKO said that in June 1958, when the unit that had :
formerly handled tourists from all countries was reorganized into
two sections, he was promoted from the rank of senior case offi-
cer to that of Deputy Chief of the newly created American Tourist
Section. NOSENKO said that this section was the most inportant
in the Tourist Department, and that he did not know why he,
in particular, had been chosen its Deputy Chief but was certain
that GRIBANOV had no voice in the decision.

ad. Knowledge of Section’s Staff and Agent Persornel

NOSENKO has named with clarity and consistency the other
officers of the American Tourist Section during this period. The
Soviet agents of his section whem NOSENKO hes identified were
mostly his own; he said that the agents were constantly shifted
from case officer to case officer end hence it was “difficult to
gay just who handled which agents." NOSENKO said he had approxi-
mately eight Soviet agents in 1958 ard about 12 or 14 in 1959, ~
most of them employed by Inturist (Pages 109-112). With the ex-
ception of the two homosexuals, YEFPE!OV and VOLKOV. discussed
separately below, NOSENKO cannot supply personal cata on his own
agents or remember specific jobs they did for the KGB.

e. Knewledge of Section's Activities

As of June 1958, according to NCSENKO, the work of the
section of which he was deputy chief was “just getting going.”
Its mission was, first of ail, to detect Western Intelligence
officers and agents among the increasing flow of tourists visit-
ing the Soviet Union; only secondarily was the section directed
toward the recruitment of KGB agents from among these tourists.
In his new position NOSENKO was responsibie for supervising
other officers in the section in efforts along these lines. Be-
cause of this and because at GRISANOV’s request he personally
reviewed KGB information on the use of tourist cover by Western
intelligence services and KGB counteraction threugh 1953 (Pages

.145-146), NOSENKO made a number of statements concerning these

subjects during the 1955-1959 period.

CIA started its so-called “legal travelle.” program in
1955 and by 1958 was deeply committed to such operations. Now
there is . firm collateral information on what the KGB knew of
this operational program. In view of NOSENKO's duties in the :
American Tourist Section and the section's prime mission, he should
have knowledge of agent compromises during 1958 and 1959. More~

’ over, thanks to collateral holdings, what NOSENKO did and did not

know can be compared with information from other sources. These
facts are reviewed below.

(i) BLAKE

A valuable source of information for the KGB in its planning

‘€or the operational activity of its Tourist Nepartment in the

late 1950's and early 1960's was the Englishman, George BLAKE
(Pages 146-147). BLAKE has confessed that in the summer of 1959

meeting during the first week of June 1959, between representa-
tives of CIA and MI-6; these sessions were on the subject of
“legal travel" intelligence operations against the USSR. This

summary spelled out in detail the corplete CIA operational doc- :
trine pertaining to tourist-type operations and stressed CIA's
reliance on tourist agents for the spotting, recontacting, assess-
ment, and communications support of internal assets. , \

While NOSENKO has displayed some familiarity with CIA nodus ‘
operandi in the field of tourist operations, he has never mer.-
tioned that the KGB was in possession of documentary reporting i.
which descrited these methods in full detail. NOSENKO does :
net appear to be aware of who BLAKE was, much less of his im-
portance to the KGE. NOSENKO never volunteered the name of
BLAKE in his Gebriefings, and when specifically asked in i962
about BLAKE, the KGB agent in Britisn Intelligence, he said
that he had read the dossier and that BLAKE had been “an acent
of che Second (British! Depertment (of the Sec ™ let s-

oO was not nearly es valuable 41s the
r the other Englismman" (VASS5ALI.). y
Couia rot recall any such agent of the Bricish Department.

When the name SLAKE was mentioned, he asked: ‘Who's BLAKE?"

BLAKE had, in addition, passed to the KGB a photocopy of
a 2l-page summary report cf a second, (4!10w-1p conference be-
tween CZA and MI-6 on “legal travel" op#:.:tions which was held
in Washington from z0 to 25 April 1960. ISENKO, although not
in the Tourist Department at the time tne latter report was
received by the KG3, said that he reviewed all important ma- .
terials of the American Tourist Section when he became its Chief
in January 1962. Asked whether the Tourist Department had re-
ceived documentary information from any agent source while ;
NOSENKO was away from the department in the years 1960-1961, Lote
he replied that none had and that he knew of no agent who could
have provided such documentary information.

(ii) GOLITSYN Document

NOSENKO in 1964 reported knowing that GOLITSYN at the time
of his defection in December 1961 took with him an official
top secret KGB document concerning Western Intellicence opera-
tional activity in the field of courism (Pages 147-149). He
did not mention this fact in the June 1962 meetings. Although
NOSENKO also stated that this document had been prepared by
the Tourist Department, he has nct been able to cescribe the
document in detail and specifically did not mention that this oy
| particular document was in large part based, as subsequent “

i . analysis has shown, upon the above-mentioned reports submitted
: to the KGB by George BLAKE, :

(iii) Tourist Agents

NOSENKO asserted that the KGB detected no agents among
American tourists during the years 1958 or 1959, and that no
tourists had been caught in the act of mailing letters, servic- ;
ing dead drops, or contacting agents, except one in 1959 whose i
name, NOSENKO said, was MacGUIRE (actually McGOWAN in 1958). i
NOSENKO signed a statement attesting to these facts. ‘

The KGB document supplied oy GOLITSYN, however, refers to
a number of cases cf American tourists who were found by the
KGB to be engaged in intelligence coliection or intelligence .
support activities. In addition to McGOWAN, the GOLITSYN eocu-

f. NOSENKO's Tourist Paper ON,
NOSENKO was questioned at length on the review of Western
tourist operations which he claimed to have written for GRiBANOV.
He said he gathered the ::aterial for this study from earlier
annual reports of the Tourist Department and by talking with
various case officers, then took the study to GRIPANOV's
office. NOSENKO could not remember whether he discussed his
findings with GaIBANOV, could not give any examples of the
information which he included in the report (other than statis-
tical information on the increase in foreign tourism), could
not recall what the report said about CIA tourist operations
(other than there appeared to be increased use of tourists ——
travelling by automobile), and did net know what other American
Intelligence services were sending agents into the Soviét Union aa
under tourist cover during these years. On the basis of his
research for this report and his cwn experience, KCSENKO said
he knew that KGB operations against tourists had been develop-
ing slowly and that, ac the time the report was written during
the tourist season of 1959, the KGB knew little about the use
of tourism by the American services.

BLAKE's confession that he passed documentary information
on this subject to the KGB, but more particularly the intensity
‘6 of KGB operations against tourists at this time as reflected
in the GOLITSYN document and other reports indicate, that this
statement by NOSENKO must be erroneous.

g. The OSWALD Case

According to NOSENKO's account of his direct involvement
in the case of Lee Harvey OSWALD (Pages 136-144), his partici-
+ pation seemed to stem solely from his supervisory role as
Deputy Chief of the American Secticn. In this capacity, NOSENKO
{ said, he was the one who made the decision that OSWALD was
*not normal" and of no interest to the KGB. On other occasions
NOSENKO has reported that he made this cecision together with
: his subordinate KRUPNOV, or that ‘they decided,” or "it was
i decided." NOSENKO’s information on the handling of OSWALD in
: 1959 is unique, and there is no collateral information against
: which it can be reliably measured. The results of the poly-
graph examination in October 1966, hcwever, indicated that
NOSENKO lied in having said that he was personally connected
-with-any-aspect-cf-the-CSWALD-case—and_that_ne_hac heard of _
OSWALD before the assassination of Presicent Kennedy: The ~
polygraph results aiso indicated that the KGB gave NOSENKO a
: special instructions on the OSWALD case and what he should tell if
i. U.S. authorities about it. ; 4

(i) General

NOSENKO appeared in one operation snortly afte: being pro-
moted to the position of Deputy Cnief, the reer itrient of the
American woman HARRIS in September 1953 on the b..3is cf har
romantic involvement with a Soviet male. HARRIS tentatively
identified NCSENKG's photograph as thet of one or two Soviets
who approached her in Moscow and said that, of the two, fe was
“definitely the » in charge.” She denied having had further
contacts with the KGB after leaving the Soviet Union. In 2953,
KOSENKO taid, he also supervised the sexual entrapment of
but did not become personally involvei in the opproach, which
was made by his superior DUBAS. Scr time during this year,
RNOSENKO said, he recruited the second of his pair cf homosexual
agents, YEFREMOV. Beginning in the srping of 1959 he used the
two in a series cf successful recruitzent approaches t)

as a commercial representative in Moscow, was not the
reeponsibility cf NOSENKO's sectzon, NOSENKO was asred to make
the appreach because he was a “specialist” in this type of
operation.) In 1959 NOSENKO aiso use? these agents in opera-
tions against two Anerican guides at the Sokoiniki Exhibit,
BRARETT and WILLERFORD. Finally, NOSE? Oo said, in 1359 he
accomplished the recruitment of the Arerican Express Company
representative in Moscow, FRIPPEL,on the basis of sexual conm-
promise.

+
(ii) The Pomosexuals FEFREMOV anc VOLYOV

There is a preponderance of homosexual recruitment opera-
tions in NOSENKO's account cf his KGB carcer. He has referred
to several homosexual agents with when he nas worked on spe-
cific recruitrent-entrapzent cperaticns, Fut seid that he ain-
self was never their cfficial case officer. They include
“LUCH," "STROYEV," “NIKOLAYEV,” "SIBIRYAK® and KOSHKIN, de has
remembered only a few of their names and has supplied no
personality inforraticn about thea. He identified caly VOLKOV
and YEPREMOV as his own agents.

NOSENKO claimed to have re-recruited VOLKOV, a former
agent (cryptcnyn “SHMELEV") aad recruited YEFREMGY (cryptonya
*"GRIGORIY”) and to have been their scle cese officer from the
beginning of their KGB carecrs in 1997-1958 until they were
deactivated in 1963 because they became too well «known. He met
them frequently, directing them in at least a dozen entrapment
operaticns or cther homosexual encouncers. NOSEXKO took then
with him whenhe transferred to the American Department in 1960
(but used them in no czgerations during 1960 and 1361) and back
again in early 1962 to the Tourist Department (where they were
used only cnce, immediately after his return). He gave a rela-
tively clear account of the recruitment (Pages 107-108), but:

- He has never been able to remember YEFREMOV's
patronya.

- He does not know the home address, general area
of Moscow residence, family circumstances, job details,

- Ne said that during the five or six years he
handled them, he never was at their homes, never met thea
in a safehouse (only on the street), and never met either
of them alone without the other's presence.

~ He did not know about VOLKOV's and YEFREMOV'S en-
counters with and developrent of one Dutch and five other
Rnecicans, independently known to Cla. of the Americans,
three were CIA agents and a fourth was the well-known
ferican diplomat and author Charles THAYER.

= He told about VOLKOV's anc YErfeMov's compromise
of Robert BARFETT in 1959 ‘Page 126) but did net know that
they had met BARRETT again in 1961, shortly befo.e BARRETT
was recruited on the basisof the 195% compromise.

- He did nct know details of why or hew VCLKOV and
YEPREMOV first cane into contact with their most recent
target, W.E. JOHNECN, nor how they set up the compromise
which led to NOSENKO's entry as a “police official" under
the name Yuriy Ivanovich XiXOLAYEV (Pages 289-293).

(iii) Eomosexual Entraree: t Cperations

Luring 1959 NCSENKO said he made recruitment approaches
to five U.S. and British citizens cn the pasigs of homosexual
entrapment operaticns involving the agents YEFREMOV and VOLKOV.
All five approaches were successful, and the four Westerners
who have now been identified have, in turn, identified NOSENKO
in one way or another as the recruiting orficer. With the ex-
ception of the FRiPPEL case and the homosexual compromise of
BARRETT and WILLORFCRD. (which did not result in approaches dur-
ing NOSENKO’s tour in the American Tourist Section), these were
the only operations in which NOSESO tock part in 1959 and
they represented, in fact, the caty recruitments by the section
during this year, NOSE:iKO said. He claimed repeatedly in 1962,
1964, and 1905 that at the erd of 1959 he received a commendsa-
tion from the KGB Chairiaan for his recruitment of the five homo-
gexuals and FRIPPLCL (@iscusse? separateiy below). In October
1966, he admitted that this claim was untrue.

In discussing the GPE case (Pages 123-124) NOSENKO had
forgotten details which, ircm his confirmed participation, he
certainly once knew. He said that (as with the SQRLyR case--
see below) another case officer (IVANOV) had the file materials
on the target before he did. NOSENKO stated that his agents

-VOLKOV. and YEFRENOY reported to NOSENKO in Moscow on

homosexuality and then “IVANOV and I and pessibly GUSKCV, the
Section Chief, reported this to DUBAS," Chief of the Tourist
Department. NOSENKO couid not remember the arrangements for
taking the pictures, nor in what Moscow hotel ‘the photography
took place. When EeERBent to Leningrad, NOSENKO wa3 sent
there to approach hin, flying alene (as in the case).
All Leningrad arrangements were made by the local kGB. Asked
why he was assigned to the case, NOSENKO replied: “I was told
to go." Asked why IVANOV could not handle it, he answered:
“He was not considered capable," his English was “not bad but
he didn't have enough operational experience." NOSENKO did
not remember who wrote the request for permission to make the

approach {evaybe I did, or maybe I dictated it to IVANOV") or
whether wqwas staying in the hotel where the Leningrad com-
promise and approach took place. He nomed the Leningrad case
officer, FERELETCV, but said that he, NOSENYO, made the re-
cruitment m™ BAid another man was pres@nt.

NOSENKO's account in general matches <—ee statements
on this apprcach (Pages 125-126). The discrepincies, as well
as the omissions in the former's statements and his uncertainty
of the facts, may be attributable to faulty memory on the part
of NOSFNKO. Although NOSENKO was at this time Deputy Section
Chief, when asked to explain his own selection as recruiting
officer, he said that he dic net know why “they" chose him
and, when pressed as to who selected him, said "DUBAS, I think,"
when asked why the case officer VETLITSKIY, who originally hud
the materials cn could not do the ject, he answered:

"Y don't knew." NOSENKUY clains that he himself arranged the
transfer of a KS3 “agent or operational contact" (he did not
remenber which) to Uzhgorod from Odessa for this case, and

said he did this only by phone calls, with nothing written,

He gave a physical description kut had no other knowledge of
this agent, neitner name nor code name nor job nor background
nor KGB status ("I wasn't interested”). The agent, he said,
travelled alone} NOSE'NKG did not arranse to receive hin in
Uzhgorod because the local KGB took care of everything. NOSENKO
met him only once, and then in the company of a case officer

of the Uzhgorod KGB, whose name or other data he has also for-
gotten. KOSENKO said he did not report to Moscow about progress
and plans on the case from Uzhgorod or other stogs in this
operation, nor obtain permission to travel alcne with the agent
to Lvov and Minsk after the recruitment; the local KGB's in
Uzhgorod, Lvov, and Minsk did that, he said. NOSENKO could

not describe KGB arrangements and support in Lvov and Minsk,
where he said “the only thing I needed was a car from the air-
port to the city.” said they travelled by train.)
Likewise, NOSENKO was unable to describe the KGB procedunes

for clearance, tracing, reporting and other management of this
operation.

(iv) The Agent FRIPPEL

FRIPPEL (Pages 129-135) is the only American citizen with
whom NOSENKO ever had more than fleeting operational contact
in his whole KGB career and is the only foreign agent he claims
to have run for more than two meetings at any time in his car-
eer (with the exception of
Pages 173-181). Zhe American Express Company representative
in Moscow, FRIPPEL was not recruited so that he could report
on American tourists visiting the Soviet Union, or on official
and unofficial Americans living there, but in hopes of learn=
ing about approaches being made to members of Scviet delegations
visiting the United States. With a weaith of reporting assets
in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB did net need him there. When
FRIPPEL was reassigned to New York City, however, there were
no plans to contact him through the local KGB Legal Residency.
FRIPPEL. is identified by. KGB cryptonym in the CHEREPANOV papers
as a suspected American Intelligence agent. That FRIPPEL was
considered such by the kG3 is confirmed by statements of a self-
admitted KGB agent in contact with the American tourist ROBERTS |
in 1962. :

NOSENXO said PRIPPEL was his agent and said, repeatedly:
"I recruited himmyself." In 1962 no other KGB officer was
mentioned by NOSENKO, who qucted from a number of his conver-
gations with FPRIPPEL. In 1964 NOSENKO said he and CHELNOKOV
"had carried out the recruitment together," but NOSENKO was the
case officer. According to PRIPPEL's account, CHELNCKOV was
the senior officer in the recruitment and in the later meetings.

NOSFNKO never met PRIPPEL alone while FRIPPEL was stationed
in Moscow. The only times he ever did so were later, he said,
when PRIPPEL returned to the USSR, and these consisted of a brief
‘visit to FRIPPEL's hotel room during FRIP?EL's visit to Moscow
in the summer of 1962 and a short meeting in Odessa where FRIP-~
PEL was on a cruise in February 1963. (Both of these meetings
took place after NOSENKO, in his 1962 contacts with CIA, had
exposed FRIPPEL as a KGB agent.) According to PRIPPEL, in the
February 1963 meeting. NOSENKO phoned someone to ask whether
he cculd accept PRIPPEL's invitation to board the ship; the
answer was evidently no. NOSENKO denied this, insisting that
there was no one in Odessa superior to nim, and as a Deputy De-
partment Chief, he would not have to ask anyone anyway.

NOSENKO, CHELNOKOV, and their wives dined at FRIPPEL's:
house in Moscow some time after FRIPPEL's recruitment. NOSENKO
acknewledged this to have been a moet unusual procedure ard
could name no parallel in KGB agent handling. Asked why it
hapcened, he said: "Because he invited me,” and when asked
why CHELNCKOV ard his wife went along, NOSENKO said: “Because
he was also involved in the recruitment.”

NOSENKO said he retained operational centrol of FRIPPEL,
then still Moscow representative of a tourist firm, when NOSENKO
shifted in June 1960 from the Tourist Department to the Areri-~
can Department; Later NOSENXO also maintained repponsibility
for contact duking FRIPPEL's visits to the USSR after FRIPPEL's
PCS departure from Moscow in January 1961 and after his own re-
turn to the Tourist Department. According to FRIPPEL, who saw
no sign of change in NOSENKO’s reponsibilities during his rela-
tionship with him, he recalled meeting CHELNOKOV (Who had
Stayed in the Tourist Department) alone, without NOSENKO, prob-
ably in 1960.

FRIPPEL said he was queried by NOSENKO and CHELNOKOV only
once concerning U.S. Embassy personalities, specifically cn
BOWDEN and WINTERS. NOSENKO, who claimed case officer re-
sponsibility for Embassy Security Officer ABIDIAN in 19€0-1961
as well as for PRIPPEL said the two did not know each other;
in fact, they met socially several times. NOSENKO could re-
call nothing which FRIPPEL ever reported to or did for the KGB,
dismissing the aubject on several occastons with: “He never
gave anything of value.” The only question NOSENKO posed
when he came to FRIPPEL in August 1962, FRIPPEL said, was
whether the agent knew “what the newspaper editors he was es-
corting were going to ask KHRUSHCHEV in an interview. Accord~-
ing to FRIPPEL, in the February 1963 meeting NOSENKO posed
no questions and merely made polite conversation until FPRIDPEL
excused himself.

Although NOSENKO's participation in five cases of the Aneri-

sources in two of them--raises doubts about whether he belonged
to that section as a senior officer. The Goubts are strengthened

by the nature of his information about the four individual cases
reviewed at length above:

- In the BURGI case NOSENKO did not have knowledge : |
of the extensive background information on the recruitment :
target which the KGE possessed at the time of the approach; :
or of other significant details in what NOSENKO described
as an operation of greatest importance to the American Tour-
ist Section and to himself persorally. In addition, NOSENKO
haa admitted lying about his having received an award for
his role in the recruitment of BUR3I. i

- Regarding the DREW case, NOSENKO said he was chosen
for the approach (made on the basis of homosexuality) be-
cause the regular case officer lacked operational experi-
ence. By April 1359, however, the KGB had arranged “hur:dreds*®
of homosexual compromises in the USSR, KOSENKO reported in
another context. His earlier personal experience with
Western targets had been limited to a secondary role in
the BURGI case and a principal role in the HARRIS case,
the letter not an approach on homosexual grounds. It is
difficult to comprchend how NOSENKO would have qualified
for the task whereas the case officer IVANOV would not.

--There are gaps in NOSENKO's inforr.ation about a
number of significant aspecte in the Beweecase, includ-
ing staff planning and maneyement of the operation, opera-
tional support arrangements, and on personnel of the outlying :
KGB units involved. NOSENKO was unable to explain why he
was selected to make the approach to

- CHELNOKOV was the senicr case officer for FRIPPEL.
NOSENKO never met this agent alone while he resided in
Moscow as the American Express Company representative,

. and .NOSENKO reportedly acted on a supervisor's instruc- i
tions at their later meeting in Odessa. Despite his occue {
pation and his entree into the American community ir Moscow, i
FRIPPEL reportedly was not exploited by the KGB against |
tourists or U.S. Government employees but was targetted
to report an matters to which he had no access; hence
there seems to have been no logical reason for the FRIPPEL j
case to have been transferred from the Arerican Tourist
Section to the U.S. Embassy Section and back again. Al- .
though available information verifies the continuity of
NOSENKO as FRIPPEL's handler, it cannot be considered firm '
evidence of NOSENKO having been an officer in either of t
these sections and in fact might be interpreted as evidence
that he was not.

' Similarly, while familiar with some but not all of the opera-_ .
tional activities of the homosexual agents VOLKOV and YEFRIMOV,
NOSENKO failed to support his claim to being their American
Tourist Section case officer; he has been unable to provide
rudimentary background information of these two individuals,
who allegedly were prominent in operations of the section.

‘YEFREMOV because they were too well known is incompatible with
hie other reporting to the effect that neither took part in an
Operation between 1959 and early 1962.

In further reference to NOSENKO's claims to having been
the case officer in these various operations, he has been ugable
to recount in any detail KGB staff procedures involved. in these
operations, such as name-tracing, coordinating with other comn-
ponents, obtaining approvals for action, etc. Finally, of his
alleged 54 months of service in the American Tourist Section,
NOSENKO's described activity against foreigners accounts for
only about three months; if the bulk of his tine was spent with
recruiting or handling Soviet-citizen agents, he might be ex-
pected to remember something about some of them. He can barely
remember names (and only a few), has given confused accounts of
their recruitment, remembers nothing about any of their spe-
cific operations or activities for the KCB, and knew no per-
sonality background data on any of then. .

Even if it were assumed that NOSENKO wags a case officer of:
the American Tourist Section, his claim to the position of Deputy:
Chief cannot be substantiated. He hinself could not explain
his appointment to the job. He did not know about the CIA:
"legal travel" operations compromised to the KGB in 1958 and
1953 when he was allegedly in @ supervisory capacity. NOSENKO
knew nothing about the documents on such operations which BLAKE
gave the KGB and which can be presumed to have been of the ut-
most interest to the American Touriet Section, among all KGB
Headquarters elements. These documents offered material that
could have proven valuable to the preparation of. NOSENKO's own
paper on Western tourist operations; they were used in the genu-
ine KGB paper written by the Tourist Department and passed to
CIA by GOLITSYN. As with his status as a case officer in the
American Tourist Section, NOSENKO the Deputy Chief could not
Gescribe how data on tourists was received, general and spe-
cific plans laid, events discussed, decisions made, and lpads
Channeled.

The foregoing paragraphs suggest the conclusion that NOSENKO
as not a senior case officer or the Deputy Chief of the Ameri-
an Tourist Section. While the methods of the Tourist Depart-
Bent are not independently known in detail, it is conceivable
that what NOSENKO did on behalf of the KGB (not necessarily the
American Tourist Section) could have been accomplished by a
““~ principal agent. These conclusions do not cast doubt about .
the facts presented by NOSENKO on the KGB investigations in the
: OSWALD case but merely rule out the possibility of NOSENKXO's
i having been involved with this case in any way prior to the
i assassination of President Kennedy.

6. U.S. Embassy Section (1969-1961)

a. Intrceduction

From January 1960 until January 15962 NOSENKD claims
to have been Deputy Chief of the U.S. Erbassy Section of
the American Department, KGB Second Chie’ Directorate,
under KOVSHUK. This period (described in Pages 152-285)
is the most significant in NOSENKO's account of his KGB
career for a number of reasons:

|

- The section is the specific unit working against
the U.S. Embassy, by 89SEC) 's cwn staterzats the KGB's
most important counterintelligence target in the USSR.
Its operations (characterized on Page 152) directly
zffect American security. The section has the twon-
fold purpose uf knowing of and controlling ali access :
of Embassy personnel to Scviet eitiz £ collecting,
assimilating, evaluating, and usirg from

all possible sources to recruit Asericans 5
in Moscow,

~ NOSENKO's position as Geputy Chief cf this sec-
tion provided hin his access to ost of the major counter-
intelligence information ne has resorted, inciuding
recruitnents of foreign embassy officials and micro-~
phone operations against the U.S. Esbassy. Most impor-
tant, it provided HOSENKO with his authority for
stating that there were no successful recruitments
of or agents among official dmericans in “oscow for
this two-year period, cr for a tize both cefore and
after. (This is the same point made by incirection in
the CHEREPANOV papers; yet this view is contradicted
by information from GOLITSYN. Although the latter did
not serve in the U.S. Fmbassy Section, he knew members
of it and gave leads to KGS operational interest in
and possible recruitments of official Americans in the
Moscow Embassy during this period. Some of these appear
to be related to information items NOSENKO nas provided.)

- The apparent importance of NOSENKO's information

on this period contrasts sharply with that from other

< periods. His accounts of recruitments in the tourist
field covering the five years prior to this assignment
and the two years following have been checked thoroughly
and not one of them represents a fenetraticn of any
government; none naz access to classified information:
most were inactive, suspect, Or already known to
Western counterintelligence organs.

b. Entry into the Section

NOSENKO has given a detailed account of how he came to
be transferred into the U.S. Embassy Section, but he has
never given a precise date, usually saying “January 1960"
or "at the beginning of 1960."

As described on Pages 153-154, the shift was made at
GRIBANOV's insistence and against NOSENKO's own personal
wishes. GKIBANOV told NOSENKO during a personal interview,
at which KOSENKO voiced his objections, that the transfer
was part of his (GRIBANOV's) plans and was primarily to put
new life into operations against American code clerks, the
primary target of the Second Chicf Directorate. GRIBANOV
did not tell him why he, instead of another, had been
selected for this job, although NOSENKO had the impression
it was because of his achievements in the Tourist Depart-
ment. (see Part VIII.P.5.). NOSENKO's transfer could not
have been a result of his close personal relationship with
GRIRANOV or because his father was a friend of GRIBANOV's;
NOSENKO has admitted that he exaggerated the closeness of
his relationship with the Chief of the Second Chief Directo-
rate and most recently (February 1965) said that he had few
personal contacts with him outside of work; NOSENKO has also
said that his father never met GRIBANOV.

NOSENKO initially said that he relieved nobody on
coming into the section. He eventually recalled, however,
that BAKHVALOV was his predecessor but left the section
before he (NOSENKO) arrived. NOSENKO's confusicn on this
point, his description of how he assumed custody of certain
files from BAKHVALOV although the latter had transferred to
another department, and the opportunities NOSENEKO had to
name BAKHVALOV as his predecessor before he eventually did
so are described on Pages 154-156.

c. Functions as Deputy Chief

In NOSENKO's view the transfer to become Deputy Chief
of the section from the same position in another section
was definitely an important promotion: He now became
second-in-charge of the most important operational section
of the entire Sccond Chief Directorate. As KOVSHUK's
deputy, NOSZNKO had the right and obligation to be aware of
all activities in order to exercise his general supervisory
functions and so as to be prepared to become the Acting
Chief of the section when necessary.

-NOSEXKO said that consequently nothing was hidden fron
him for the two years 1960 and 1961. He claimed to have
had complete knowledge of the U.S. Embassy Section's activi-
ties during the relatively recent years of 1960 ard 1961
and to know of all significant operational successes achieved

in the years before and after this period. He has alsa_said he
has told CIA all he knows of these activities. It was on this

basis that he was able to say in 1965: "Tell ‘tr. scCone
that there were no recruitments. I was there."

When NOSENKO reported for duty, he and KOVSHUK agreed

on a division of supervisory duties within the section.
KOVSHUK was, in addition to his over-all responsibility for

the section's operations, to supervise in particular opera-
tional activity against American diplomatic personnel assigned
to the U.S. Fmbassy. SOSENKO had been specifically instructed
by GRIBANOV and American Department Chief KLYPIN to concentrate
his efforts on the supervision of operations against the i
most important American recruitment target, the code clerks

at the Embassy, with the aim of revitalizing these acti-
vities and making recruitments. (NOSENKO said there had

been none since the early 1950's.) According to the agreed-
upon division of labor, NOSENKO also assumed cese officer
responsibility for John ABIDIAN. the Embassy Security offi-
cer (identified by WSENKO 3s a CIA officer. duc actually a
CIA cooptee). Additionally, he was responsible for maintaining
the section's file on factors pertaining to the physical
security of the Embassy and for receiving and disseminating
materials frou the microphones concealed in various U.S.
Enbassy offices. These were functions held, NOSENKO said,

by hig predecessor BAKHVALOV and were turned over by NOSENKO
at the end of 1961 to his successor GRYAZNOV: Apart from
these duties, which apparently were routinely assumed by

the Deputy Chief, NOSEXKO supervised, during the early part

of 1960 (as NOSENKO first said in 1965), the work of the
officers responsible for operations againat.the Amorican

Avmed Forces Attaches in Muscow; Ln October 1966, NOSENKO
reported that he was personally responsible during this

period for the operatioml activity against Naval and Marine
officers in the Naval Attache's office.

d. xnowledgeability as Deputy and Acting Chief

As deputy to KOVSIUK, NOSENKO said, he was aware of
all the operations being conducted by the section during
this two-year period; by his own statenent, nothing was
kept from him. There were in these two years a total of
over three months when KOVSHUK was ill or on leave, and at
these times NOSENKO was acting chief of the section. In
the latter capacity, NOSENKO was responsible for supervising
the administrative work and operational activity of the en-
tire section and, in particular, assumed KOVSiHUK's work ip
directing operations against diplomatic personnel assigned to
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Therefore, pertinent to his
claims are the facts presented in the following paragraphs.

NOSENKO could not remember any operational decisions
that he made as acting chief, or any specific or unusual
occurrences during these times. In answer to a question,
NOSENKO said that the only specific responsibility of KOVSEUK's
which he handled in the Chief's absence was reporting to the
Chief of the First Department about all correspondence going
out of the U.S. Embassy Section.

NOSENKO did not meet any of KOVSHUK's agents during his
absences. He could not remember any of KOVSHUK's agents,
except GLAZUNOV (whom NOSENKO said in April 1964 was his own
agent and later said was "KOVSHUK's and FEDYANIN's") and
the American correspondent STEVENS (about whom NOSENKO had
reported in connection with his responsibilities in 1953-55).
NOSENKO also said that in 1960 KOVSHUX recruited PREISFREUND,
elthough earlier he had reported that he (SOSENKO) had dose
this. (Regardless of who:the recruiter might have been,
KOVSHUK attended NOSENKO's meetings with PREISFREUND. )

WINTERS. He knew no details of KOVSHUX's contzcts with(WINTERS,

7cs,

NOSENKO knew that his immediate supervisor KOVSEUK had per-
gonal contect, under Ministry of Foreign affairs ccver, with sore
U.S. Embassy offisers and was aware that one of these had been

nor that his own friend KISLOV, as well as his friend and few-
quent source of operational information LOPUMHCV, were also in
touch with WINTERS. He could not remember who else KOVERUK

knew, cr what KOVSHUK was doing with them, or why. NOSENKO ;
knew neither that William MORRELL (@eclared to the Soviet Govern- .
ment as a CIA officer) belonged to CIA nor that KOVSHUK, who
was aware of this fact, was in personal contact with MORELL.

Unlike KOVSHUH, ARTEMEV, KOSOLATOV, BORODIN, BIRYUKOV,
KRIVOSHEY and many other Second Chief Directorate officers,
HOSCNKO never had any direct contact, even for cultivation
or cssessment, with any Americar officials, either stationed
in the Embassy or visiting the USSR. However, his English
had been proven gcod enough to qualify him particularly for
tourist recruitments and his operational flair hed been tested,
(It was this which caused him to be picked for the. DPEd,

anc other approaches and the cnly 1easor why he,
an ingiish Speaker, would © been specially selected to
work on the German who spoxe “some Englis5.”)

PERYABIN and other defectors from the KGS have stated
that the deputy chief of a section working against 2 foreign
exbassy in Mosccw would be responsible for approving and
retaining monthly schedules for the planned use cf safehouses
by the section; that be would discuss agent meeting scuedules
with individval case officers and approve and retain a list
of planned agent meetings for each case officer on an indi-
vidual basis; and that he sould approve the acquisition of new
agents and new safehouses and their transfer frou one opera-
tion to another. by contrast, NOSENYO first did not list
these functions among his responsibilities and later denied
that he had them. NOSENKO did rot understand the questica
when asked whether he had any responsibility for supervising
the use of safehozses in Moscow (Paze 102) anc said that as
the agents and the safehouses belonged to the case cfficers,
they could use them when and how they Liked without informing
anyone; only when they were meeting an active development
agent was it necessary to report to NOSENKO and this only
after the meeting. XOSENKO said that, while he was ceputy j
Chief of the section, three or four subordinate officers had i
safe apartments, but he did not remember the location of any
of them. Neither NOSENKO ner his subordinates GRYACNOV and
KOSOLAPOV had such apartments, instead using less secure
"meeting apartrents"” (which are used in the absence cf the
full-tire occupant). NOSENKO was able to locate his own
“meeting apartment" (which he said ne brought with him when
he transferred from the Tourist Department and iater took .
back with him to the Tourist Department) by street and could
do the same for GRYAZNOV's. He was not sure of the lecation
of the apartment used by KOSOLAPOV.

e. Knowledgeavility of U.S. Embassy Physical Security

According to NOSENKO, he maintained the file on physical
security at the U.S. Embassy, and it contained detailed
floor pians and photograpns of the installation. NOSEXKO was
unable to give the location or the floor of the office of
any single individual or component of the Embassy, including
those of the Ambassador, or his own targets (ABIDIAN, the
military code room, and the State Department comaunicationa
room).  NOSKNKO vada Chat ett daportant Rabaody of (ied
were located in the “gone of securtly.” which he haa vartuualy
reported as the “seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth floors,"
or “seventh and up,” or the “top four floors." NOSENXO did
not remember how many floors there are in the Embassy, nor
was he even sure how many floors were included in the restric-
ted area. (The restricted area in fact consists of the top
three floors, the eighth, ninth, and tenth.)

f. Knowledgeability about American Intelligence Personnel

XNOSENKO said that not only the deputy chief but every
officer in the section cculd identify the known and suspected
American Intelligence personnel in the Embassy. Nevertneless,
he himself did not know about three CIA officers (MAHONEY,
‘MORELL., and GARBLER) whoa the KGB had definitely identified
as such before their assignments to Moscow in 1960-1961. For
example, .MORELL , whose overt CLA affiliation was officially
announced by the Embassy to the Soviet Minister of Foreign
Affairs, was under direct and active cultivation by KOVSH-K
and the KGB First Chief D:rectorate officer K.N. SMIRSOV in
1960-1961; NOSENKO knew nothing about this (although asked
leading questions znd given hints) and did not identify
“WORELL as a CIA officer. Four of the seven officers whos
he said the KGB suspected to be CIA had never had any such
affiliation. He could not give any information at all .oo
the person he said the KGB considered to be the CIA chief
in Moscow, KLOSSON, either on his Moscow activity and contacts
or on the extent and results of KGB coverage,.or on his per-
sonal situation and background. He could not explain why
KLOSSON was considered to be the CIA chief, but said that
“every officer thought he was.”

g- Knowledgeability of KGB Code Clerk Operations

As his main task, the prime reason he was moved into
the U.S. Embassy Section, NOSENKO alleged, was to supervise
the operational work against American code clerks. In this
capacity he closely guided the work of case officers GRYAZNOV
and KOSOLAPOV.* NOSENKO shared an office with his two sub-
ordinates, and the three were within sight and hearing of

—_—_——

*According to GOLITSYN, who knew both men well. GRYAZNOV was
"a very experienced" case officer with some success; he had
spent about the last five years of his 16 years in the KGB

in the Amcrican Department and was a specialist in code

clerk operations. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had about

ten years' KGB experience and, Like GRYAZNOV, was specializing
against code clerks in 1960.

one anothcr and used a single safe, which contained files
on the Anerican code clerks and the agents involved with then.
NOSENKO said that he carefully directed the work of GRYAZNOV

. and KOSOLAPOV during these two years, discussing their cases
with them, taking part in operational planning, and approving
or disapproving all operational measures. NOSENKO originally
asserted that he tad also read and studied all the files
kept on the American code clerks; under questioning on indivi-
dual cases, however, he retracted these statements ard said
that ho may Lave skimmed some of the files, that he did not
study any of them, but that in any event he read all the
current incoming materials on the code clerks from microphones,
agents, and the like and then routed them to the case officer’
concerned.

t
[-

CIA has two types of information against which the reo
ports from NOSENKO can be compared. The first consists of
the detailed cebriefings of code clerks returning from
Moscow, administered routinely by the Department of State
and the military services; it also includes the special de-
briefings and interrogations of the Departnent of State,
the FBI, and CIA as a follow-up to KGB opcrational activity
which has become known from various sources, On this basis,
CIA has accumulated a considerable amount of collateral
information on the activities of the U.S. Exbassy Section
involving United States code clerks during the period NOSEN= :
KO said he was its Deputy Chief, The second type of infor- p
mation is the reporting on KGB operations by GOLITSYN who,
from contacts with U.S. Embassy Section officers in Moscow
and Helsinki, was able to provide several lcads to what he
said were recruitcd American code clerks. GOLITSYN's infor-
mation thereby directly contradicts NCSENKO's statement that
the KGB had no successes in its code clerk recruitment opera~
tiens from the early 1950's to the end of 1963, and none of
the subjects of GOLIISYN's leads have been positively identi-
fied. Some of GOLITSYN's information has been generally
substantiated by other sources. In one case, this confirma-
tion has cone from NOSENKO himself, whose information on the

‘STORSDERG operation, on the agent PREISFREUND's role in it, |
and on GOLITSYN's knowledge of KGB use of PREISFREUND pre-
sents an explanation of one and possibly two of GOLITSYN's

: leads.* Another of GOLITSYN's leads, that concerning an

i operational trip by KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki in order to estab-

! lish contact with a code clerk, is confirmed by documentary
evidence that KOSOLAPOV did in fact travel on the Helsinki-
Moscow train with an American code clerk at the time and
under the cover GOLITSYN reported. NOSENKO denied that such
a trip was made by KOSOLAPOV.

NOSENKO has been questioned in detail about each of the
code clerks serving in Moscow during 1960 and 1961. His in-
formation concerning KGB activities involving five of these
Americans (STORSBERG, JENNER, MORONE, ZUJUS, and KEYSERS) and

accounts of GOLITSYN and NOSENKO, particularly regarding the

his lack of information concerning a sixth (GARLAND) is
discussed in detail in Pages 166 through 219. NOSLNKO’s
information on a number of other cases, less important in
his opinion, is described in the tabulation of American
case leads given on Pzges 364-410. Certain of these cases
are further examined below to determine whether NOSENKO'S
knowledge equates with details which the deputy and acting
chief of the U.S. Embassy Section could reasonably be
expected to knov and retain.

(1) The STORSBERG Case

The operation against STORSBERG (Pages 166-185) was,
NOSENKO said, the must important case he had as supervisor
of code clerk operations. The KGB, while able to break
certain State Department ciphers, had had no success with
military cryptographic systems, and therefore NOSENKO
“dropped everything for a year" to involve himself with the
development of James STORSBERG, the military code clerk at
the U.S. Embassy. The following facts are pertinent to an
evaluation of XOSENKO's story of this case.

NOSENKO originally raised the STORSBERG case indirectly
at his first meeting with CLA on 9 June 1962. He told how
GOLITSYN, during a visit to the American Department in 1960,
at a time NOSENKO was on leave, had requested permission
to use a U.S. Embassy Section agent, a Finn, in his own opera-
tions in Helsinki. During his discussions in the American
Department, GOLITSYN learned that this Finnish agent was
being used in operations against Embassy employees living ip
America House. NOSENKO said that the KGB realized that
GOLITSYN had passed this information on to the Americans
following his defection, for the regulations governing
visits to America House by third nationals had been tightened.
At this meeting NOSENKO did not name the Finnish agent or
specify his involvement in any particular operational acti-

vity nor did he date the visit by GOLITSYN.

Later in the 1962 meeting NSOSENKO gave a detailed
summary of the Finnish agent's involvement in the unsuccess~
ful recruitment attempt against an Americar military code
clerk. NOSENKO, without naming the Finn or the American,
said that he personally conducted the recruitment confron-
tation with GRIBANOV present. These early accounts vere full
of quotes of what SOSENKO said to the American and vice
versa. descriptions of the American's reaction to the confron-
tation, and statenents of NOSEXKO's admiration for the Ameri-
can despite his refusal to work. Following his defection,
NOSENKO recounted the case in even greater detail, in fact,
in more detail than he gave for any other case. He identi-
fied the Finn as PREISFREUND ard the American as STORSBERG
and described acd referred to the case whenever possible
(over 50 times). When asked for dctails of other code clerk
cases, for example, he repeatedly diverted to discussion of
the STORSBERG case to illustrate how the KGB operated against

code clerks in general.

_ After defecting NOSENKO denied that he personally con-
fronted STORSBERG. He said that his personal role was limited
to directing STORSEERG into the hotel rooa where the approach
was made; after first saying that he had never clained any
other role, he admitted that he may have been "painting"

himself (exaggerating) ip his descrip ions of 1962, This ‘
adwission came only after the tape of NOSENKO's 1362 :
statezents had been played to him and he had successively
said that (a) it was not his voice, (b) he was drunk in

1962, (e) the CIA case officer in Geneva had made hin
nervous, and (d) CIA probably spliced various picces of

tape together to make this false one. Still, NOSENKO

said, he directed the entire operation from beginning to end,
and it was his most important case. Interrogated further
concerning his role in the STORSBERG operation in October
1936, NOSENKO said that he had never read the KGB file on
STORSBERG, which was held by GRYAZNOV, .

GOLITSYN, as NOSENKO reported, didvisit the American —
Department, did request permission to use PREISFREUND operaa
tionally in Helsinki, and did report this to CIA in late
196) following his defection. GOLITSYN also reported that,
in denying his request, KOVSHUK told him that PREISFREUND
had recently been used in the successful recruitment of an--
American Embassy employce, possibly a military man and pos#
sibly a code clerk or diplomat; therefore, KOVSHUK said,
PREYSFREUND: could rot be used for six months or so in other
operations, for otherwise the Anericans might become suspi-
civus. NOSENKO has not reported these details, but has said
only that GOLITSYN was instructed to. drop interest in PRZIS-
FREUND because PREISFREUND belonged to the American Department
of the Second Chief Directorate. ~ .

NOSENKO volunteered at his first meeting with CIA that

he was on leave outside of Noscow on the occasion of COLITSYN's

visit to the American Department. Since defecting he has
insisted with absolute certainty that this visit took place
in the late spring or early summer of 1961 and has described
his leave, where he went and with whom. GOLITSYN's passport
and CIA travel data show that GOLITSYN was on TDY in Moscow
in January 1961.* Told this, NOSENKO said that it is untrue,
that he recalled being told of GOLITSYN's visit after his
return from leave in July ‘1961, and that he was certain that
ke (NOSENKO) was in Moscow in January 1962.

NOSENKO has indirectly confirmed that the operation of
which GOLITSYN learned during this visit to the American
Department was the operation against STORSBERG. He did so by
bis assertion that PREISFREUND, his own agent, was used in
only one operation, that against STORSBERG, Thus, as to the
outcome of this operation, there is a conflict between NOSEN-
KO's information and that earlier provided by GOLITSYN.

There is also a conflict between NOSENKO's statements that
the recruitment approach took place some time after May 1961
(NOSENKO's dates have varied from June to October 1961,.
STORSBERG. said it was in October 1961) and GOLITSYN's state-
ment that this approach had already been made in January 1961
when he learned of it.

GOLITSYN provided a second lead which NOSENKO appears
to confirm and which may be related to the STORSBERG case.
GOLITSYN said that during & visit to the American Department

seeps

in the spring of 1960,* he learned from GRYAZNOV that he
(GRYAZKOV) had developed an operation against an American
military code clerk to the point that the KGB was "99 '
per cent" certain that a recruitment approach to this code
clerk would be successful. GOLITS’N said that CRYAZNOV

told him that this would be the first recruitment of a mili-
tary code clerk (ag contrasted to a State Department code
clerk) in the history of the American Department. There
were only two persons meeting this criterion who were in
Yoscow at the tine GOLITSYN placed this visit, STORSBERG

ard HNURLEY; the superior of STORSBERG, HURLEY per forned
back-up cryptographic duties in STORSBERG's absence. If
SOSENKO's report that there was no developacnt of or approach
to HURLEY can be accepted, this lead from GOLITSYN would
apply to STORSBERG rather than HURLEY. There is a conflict
hbotween NOSENKO's information on the STORSBERG case and this
second GOLITSYN lead in that GOLITSYN described an operation
which was in its final stages in the spring of 1960, whereas
NOSENKO (as well as STORSBEPG) asserted that the STORSBFRG
operation was just under way at this time and was long and
drawn-out. . .

(if) The JENNER Case

Apart from the STORSBERG operation, NOSENKO has been
able to supply the greatest amount of detail concerning the
operation (also unsuccessful) against the State Departcent
pouch clerk Paul JENNER (Pages 186-196). This case developed
as a result of an idea originated by NOSENKO himself shortly
after be arrived in the U.S, Embassy Section. Because of
the inaccessibility of American code clerks to the RGB in
Moscow, it was NOSENKO's plan to send a KGB officer to Hel-
ginki in order to strike up an acquaintance with a code

-elerk entering the Soviet Union aboard the Helsinki-Noscow

train. The first (and last) time this was attenpted, NO-
SEXKO related, was in March 1960, when the KCB learned that
JENNER, listed as a "secretary-archivist” and thus assumed
by the KGB to be a code clerk, was scheduled to transit
Helsinki en route to his assignaent at the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow. Under NOSENKO's supervision KOSOLAPOV therefore
travelled to Helsinki and boarded the same train as JENNER.
Additionally, GRYAZNOV took a KGB female agert to the town,
of Vyborg, on the Finno-Soviet border, and placed her on the
same train. Both KOSOLAPOV and the female agent met and
spoke with JENNER en route to Moscow, and the girl gave hin
her telephone number, asking him to call her. After JENNER's
arrival in Moscow, both KOSOLAPOV ard GRYAZNGV submitted
written reports to NOSENXO describing the contacts on the
train. Although the KGB later found out that JENNER was only
a pouch clerk, not a cryptographer, he was considered of
interest and when JENNER failed to telephone the female
agent, the two were brought together in a “chance meeting"
at the Moscow airport, JzNNER: would have no part of the
agent's invitations, however, and the operation therefore
went no further.

#¥hen NOSENKO was told of the GOLITSYN visit in Nay or June
1960, he denied that it took place, saying that he reces-
sarily would know if it had.

JENNER reported te the Security Officer at the U.S.
Embassy upon his arrival that he had been contacted by two
Soviet students from Vyborg, @ young mai and a voman, on
the Helsinki-Moscow train. He alse reported having been
given a telephone nutber by the girl and later reported
having been recontacted by her at the Moscow airport.

CIA has documentary eviderce, in the forn of official
Firrish train manifests, that JENNER travelled from Helsinki
to Moscow by train on 31 March 1960. This docuszent shows
that JENNER travelled alone and no Soviets werc aboard when
the train lett Helsinki. CIA also has an official travel
manifest showing that KOSOLAPOV, using the name KOLOSOV,
travelled from Helsinki to Moscow by rail on 2 April 1960,
two days later, and that no Americans travelled on this train
with him. KOSENKU identified KOLOSOV's photograph as that
of his subordinate KOSOLAPOV. (NOSEXKO earlier said that .
he did not know whether KOSOLAPOV used an alias for‘this
trip, what that alias might have been, or whether KOSOLAPOV
had an alias passport; he agreed that he would have had to
authorize such a passport.) When he was told of CIA evidence
that KOSOLAPOV did not travel on the same train as JENNER
and therefore could not have met and talked with him as
XOSENKO had reorted, NOSENKO refused to believe it; he in-
sisted that he had read the reports of both KOSOLAPOV and .
GRYAZKOV, and that the events were exactly as he described j
then. :

(4ii) The GARLAND Case

GOLITSYN told CIA after his defection that while he was :
stationed in Helsinki, probably in November~-not March,--1960, :
KOSOLAPOV travelled to Finland under alias and commercial ,
cover in order to make the acquaintance of an American code
clerk on the Helsinki-Moscow train. KOSOLAPOV's arrival had
been announced by a cable from KGB Neadquarters to the
Helsinki Legal Residercy. According to GOLITSYN, the Legal
Residency learned which train this American was to board and
succeeded in placing KOSOLAPOV in the same compartment with
him. GOLITSYN saw KOSOLAPOV board the train with this Ameri-
can. Later, when another American Department officer visited
Helsinki, GOLITSYN asked him how KOSOLAFOVY's operation with
the code clerk had gone; from the officer's refusal to answer, i)
GOLITSYN assumed that it had been a success.

CIA travel records show that. KOSOLAPOV made a second
trip to Helsinki in November 1960, again under the KOLOSOV
alias. #innish railroad manifests show that KOSOLAPOV left
Helsinki by train on 16 November 1960 and that one ‘¢ his
travelling companions on this train was GARLAND, who was
en route to Moscow to assume his duties as chief of the
State Department code room at the American Embassy (Page
198), There were no other Americans on this train.

Told that KOSOLAPOV had made a trip to Helsinki in
November 1960 and had travelled to Moscow on the same train
as an American code clerk, one of his own targets, NOSENKO
said that this could not be. He agreed that, as in the case
of KOSOLAPOV's trip to meet JENNER, he would necessarily
have been involved in the planning of such a second trip
and would have had to approve arrangements and correspondesce
in connection with it. Even if such a trip took place when
NOSEKKO was out of Moscow, he said, the details of it would

have been known to him upon his return, and he would not

ane ™

have forgotten about the trip. (in fact, CIA travel records show

that KOSOLAPOV arrived in Helsinki on 12 Noveaber 1960 and
that NOSENKO left Moscow for Ansterdam, en route to Cuba,
on 15 November.) NOSENKO has not changed his position that
there was no such trip.

(iv) The MORONE Caso

Like the STORSBERG operation, the MORONE case was men-
tioned at NOSENKO's first meeting with CIA; he cited it as
an example of a technique which NOSEXKO introduced for using
third nationals to obtain access to American code clert:s who
were reluctant to establish contacts with Soviet citizens.
According to NOSENKO's most recent version, given in early
1965, the KGB learned that MORONE and a Marine Guard (BEGGS)
planned to travel to Warsaw on leave. KOSOLAPOV thereupon
drew up an operational plan, edited by NOSENKO and KOVSHLE
and approved by GRIBANOV, proposing that a female agent of
the Polish UB be introduced to MCRONE on the “oscow to War-
saw train for the purpose of obtaining comproxising materials.
KOSOLAPOV arranged with Polish liaison officials in Noscow
to have such an agent sent to Moscow, met her when she
arrived, and briefed her on the operation, She was then
piaced on MORONE's train together with a KGB technician

whose task it was to obtain tape recordings of the compro
mise. Events went according to plan: MORONE. «ct the girl

and was intimate with her on the train, but when the tech-
nician reported to NOSENKO the day after the train arrived
in Warsaw, he said that the tape recordings were of low
quality and unsuitable for their intended purpose. In a
further attempt to acquire coaprouring material on MORONE,
KOSOLAPOV later brought the UB agent to Moscow, and on this
occasion photographs were obtained of their intimacies in

a woscow hotel room. Still, the KGB felt, there was not
enough blackmail matcrial to ensure recruitment, and it was
further planned to have the America House maid LVANOVA
attempt to lure NORONE to a room in Moscow where truly
comprooising photographs of intimacies with a Sovjet citi-
zen could be obtained. Possibly because they noticed MORONE's
interest in IVANOVA, NOSENKO said, the Americans ordered
MORONE out of Moscow before further steps could be taken.

Although NOSENKO provided a considerable amount of
detail on MORONE's trip to Warsaw, there were numerous
variations in his different accounts. In 1962 he said
that he had handled the entire operation himself, including
telephoning Warsaw with the request for the girl; he also
said that the UB obtained compromising photographs in Warsaw
and that several months lates the female agent was brought
to Moscow expressly for the purpose of introducing MORONE to
a Soviet girlfriend, This, NOSENKO said, was successful and
MORONE was soon having intercourse with a KGB agent. While
still in place in Geneva on 1 February 1964 NOSENKO gave a@
different version: "We," he said, arranged for the girl by
a dispatch pouched to the KGB advisor in Warsaw; moreover,
the Poles, who had obtained compromising photographs in War-
Saw, sent the KGB only pictures of the two kissing, keeping
the best oncs for themselves, and this is why she had to be
brought to Moscow. NOSENKO told the FBI later in February
1964 that compromising photographs had been obtained in War-
saw but no recruitment was attempted because KHRUSHCHEV had

given instructions that no actions were to be taken which
might embarrass then existing good relations with the United
States. When in February 1365 it was pointed out that MORONE
arrived in Warsaw on 14 December 1960 and that NOSENKO left
for Cuba on 15 Ncvember 1960, NCSENKO revised his story of
receiving the personal report of the technician to say that
he had perhaps reed the technician's report after returning
from Cuba in cecember 1960.

CIA learned of the MORONE train. trip and subsequent
involvement with the UB agent in 1961 from a Volish scurce
who had provided much sensitive and reliable information
previously. The Polish source submitted a considerable
amount of detail including the date of the operation (which
NOSENKO did not recall) and the fact that the Polish agent’.
was handled in Moscow by a KGB officer named “Volodya.* 4
It was on the basis of ‘this report that MORONE was withdrawn {,
from Moscow in May 1961.

In accounts given since his defection, NOSENKO has con-
sistently nazed KOSOLAPOV as MORONE's case officer. KCSOLA~
POV drafted tne plan for the operation on the train, discussed
it with NOSEN%O and KOVSHUK, met with a U3 official in Mcscow
to arrange for the agent, met the agent on her arrival, and
briefed her on her assignment. NCSENKO has not been asked
and has not volunteered who specifically placed the agent
on the train. Records show, however, that MORONE left Moscow
on 13 November 1960, arriving in Warsaw on the 14th; from
12 to 16 November 1960, KOSOLAFOV is confirmed to have been
in Helsinki, apparently in connection with an operation in-
volving the Aterican code cler% GARLAND (see above). It is
also noted that travel records show that NOSENKO, the officer
supervising this (as well, presumably, as KOSOLAPOV'S trip

, to Helsinki), left Moscow on 15 November 1960 with a dele-
_ gation going to Cuba.

NOSENKO has been questioned concerning the KGB agents

in contact with MORONE and what was learned from them. He
reported that an Egyptian agent visited America House, met
MORONE there, but did not report anything of interest con-
cerning him. NCSEKKO also mentioned IVANOVA, a maid at

j America Bouse, who knew MORONE and whom the XGB wantec to use

‘ to lure MOPONE into a compromising situation (see above).

' NOSENKO said that he, himself, had met with IVANOVA several
times to discuss MURONE, but that he could not recall any-
thing specific of interest or use that she reported concerning

him. Another agent who may have reported on MORONE, NOSENKO
said, was an East Geraan girl sent to Ancrica Howse to pose
as an Austrian; NCSENKO was not sure wnat she sight have
reported or when this was, other than it occurred when he
was working against WORONE and that it wes durirg ABIDIAN's
tour in doscow, for he had coze tu America Ifouse to question
the girl.

Various reperts indicato that VORONE was. involved in
illegal currency speculation with the Egyptiar acent and
that on at leas‘ une occasion the Feyptian introduced MGRONE
to a Sovict female, with whom MORONE was intimate. NOSE*KO
did not know that NORONE was also involved in illegal cur=-
rency dealings with GSaiggEpshon NOSENKO has identified as
KOSCLAPCY's agent aid who, ne said, was involved with and
reporting on NOSENKO'S target ABIDIAN. NOSENKO did not know
that I¥ANOVA once incroduced WORONE to a Soviet female, with
whom MORONE was intinate; additionally MORONE was reported
by a nusber of his co-residents at America House to nave been
intimate with IVANOVA herself (which MORONE denied). Some ht
of these samc Amcricans reported also that MORONE was inti- -
mate with UMANETS, another KGB agent identitied by NOSENKO;
MORGNE hinself said he knew UNANETS "Vell." Finally, the
incident involving the East German girl posing ag an Austrian
involved the code clerk ZUJUS, not MORONE, and took place
after NOSENKO clains to havo been transferred frem tne U.S.
Embassy Section; she was interviewed by ABILIAN's sucet: ssor,
MONTGOMERY. .

(v) The KEYSERS Case

The approach to KEYSERS is the only tine during his
service in the U.S, Embassy Section that NOSEXKO claims to
have had direct contact with an American stationed in ose
cow. (NOSENKO said on one occasion that this was the only
face-to-face encounter he could recall; and, on another, -
that it was possible that STORSEFRG--the only other possibility--
may not have seen hia on the night he was approached in the
Moscow hotel.) KEYSERS therefore is the only independent
American source who could confirm that NOSENKO was involved
in operations against Aacrican Enbassy personnel in 1960 or
1961. NOSENKO himself pointed cut, hovever, that this cor-
tact was of very short duration, and that it was possible
that KEYSERS would not yecognize him, This was the case:
KEYSERS failed to identily NOSENKO's photograph and described
the officer wno approachcd him as a man considerably older,
shorter, and probably of a much heavier build than NOSENKO
was. Although NOSENKO was able to provide a descriptioa of
this incident, he did not know much about the overall KGB
caso against KEYSERS and a number of discrepancies have been
noted. ,

In 1962 NOSENKO first reported the approach to KEYSERS,
without naming him, but saying he was the successor to STORS-
BERG, Since defecting in 1964, XOSENKO has continued to
identify hin as STCRSBERG's replacement. In fact, KEYSERS
was sent to Moscow as an assistant to the Embassy medical
officer; he also worked in the office of the Air Attache as
a collateral duty and for a short while in 1961 was under
training in the military code room as a "back-up" crypto=-
grapher for STORSbERG. STORSBERG's replacement in Moscow
was ZUJUS.

JOP SECRET, |

718.
On 24 and 28 January 1964, before the defection, NO-
SENKO incorrectly named ZUJUS, who he seid was STORSBERG'S
replacement, as the target of this operation. On 2 February
1964 KOSENKO called a special meeting with his CIA handlers,
to correct this mistake. He said that, in fact, KEYSERS
was STORSBERG’s replacement, and the approach had been made
to him. (Thus NOSEXKO had forgotten the name of the one
American Embassy official he ever approached. )

seeeeg nes

In February 1965 NOSENKO said that the KGB believed
that KEYSERS did rot report the receipt of the defection
letter and that there was no indication that he had from
microphones or telephone coverage of the U.S. Embassy. In
fact, KEYSERS reported the letter at once in the office of
the Military Attache, where a microphone was discovered in ;
1964. NOSENKO had earlicr said that this particular micro+
phone was being monitored around the clock by the KGB.
(KEYSERS' homosexuality and drinking problems kad also
been discussed widely in Embassy offices. NOSENKO was
unaware of these discussions.) ’
NOSENKO did not know correctly where or how the KGB.
de@ivered to KEYSERS the letter which preceded the airport
approach which NOSENKO claimed to have made.

(vi). Other Code Clerk Cases

Frark DAY: XNOSENKO identified DAY as a State Department
code clerm and the target of either KOSCLAPOV or GRYAZNOY.
As with all other code clerks, NOSENKO was asked whether he
knew of eny interesting information about DAY, whether he
knew of any of DAY's friends in Moscow, or of his travels
inside and outside the Soviet Union, etc. NCSENKO answered
“no” to all these questions. He said that the KGB had no
derogatory information on DAY, was unaware of any vulner-
abilities he might have had, and that no operational mes-
sures were taken against him. Records show that DAY was in
Moscow from way 1960 to October 1961. In July 1961 he tra-
velled to the Caucasus with his friend, the U.S. Agricul~
tural Attache BROWN, formerly an overt CIA employee. DAY
later reported that the two were under surveillance by five
persons at all times on this trip, that on ore occasion they
found four “repairmen” in their hotel room upon returning 3
unexpectedly ahead of schedule, and that another time during
this trip an “attractive and available Soviet female" was
placed in their train compartment.

John TAYLOR: NOSENKO said TAYLOR was a State Department
code clerk ard the target of KOSOLAPOY. NOSENKO did not
know of TAYLOR'S previous service abroad or of any back-
ground information the KGB might have had about hin. He
described an operation against TAYLOR which centered around’
his intimacy with a Russian maid (a KGB agent) and his sym=
pathy towards the Soviet Union and its people. No compro-
mising photographs were obtained of TAYLOR and the maid,
however, and no approach was made to hin, possibly because
the KGB did not want to jeopardize the more important STORS-
BERG case by creating a “flap.” According to TAYLOR, he was
intimate wit his maid from about September 1960 until the
beginning of 1961. On one occasion they were intimate in a
“friend's apartment” in Moscow. NOSENKO did not know that
the maid told TAYLOR she was pregnant or that TAYLOR ‘offered

her. money for an abortion. TAYLOR left Moscow in February
1961, whereas the epproach to STORSPERG wes reported by
NOSEXEO and STORSBERG ‘to have occurred four to cight months
afterward.

Waurice ZWANG: NOSENKO identified ZYANG as a State
Departsent code clerk who was "actively worked on” during
the 1960-196) period. An Fgyrtian agent, whose naze NOSEN-
KO did not recall, introduced ZWANG to e rersle KGB agent
in en attesapt to obtsin compromising phctcgraphs, but the
agent did not like ZWANG nnd refused to have intercou:se
with him. At the time NOSENKO left the U.S, Embessy Sec-
tion in January 1962, there was no further activity sur-
rounding Z¥ANG, The KGB had no agentes in cortact vith hia,
and there wes ro vulnerzbility data concerning hin. hen
ZWANG was interviewed by the State Department after returuing
from his Moscow assignment, ma polygraph exsnination indicated
that ZWANG hed had intercourse with his Russian raid, else-
where identified by NOSENXO as a KGB agent; Z*ANG scmitted
visiticg the maid's apartment several tines but denied
intimacies. In March or April 1961, an Egyptian intreduced
ZWANG to another Soviet female; Z#ANG also acmitted visiting
her apartnent on several occasions, but again denied having
had intercourse with her. ZWANG was reported by various
other Americens stationed tn Moscow to have been active in
currency speculation and blrckmarketecring with the Egyptian
an FRPP and agent of KOSOLAPOV according to NOSENKO.
NOSEAHO sas unaware of this.

all coveraye of the Embassy Security Officer Jota V, ABIDIAN,

in Moscow in early 1950, and that he turned tris file over
officially to his successor, GRYAZNOV, when transferred from
the U.S. Entass; Section at the end of 19C1. Jt wes NOSENKO
sho wrote the k38 plan for operations agsinst ABIDIAN in
about October 1969. APMINPLAN, eccording to NOSENKO, was con-
sidered by the KGB ta be #2 Cla officer aid, as LANGELLE's i
suceessor, 4as also considered to be the nost important :
counterintelligence target in the Enbassy. ABIDIAN was thus
made a special target of surveillance fron the day of his
arrivel in the USER; this seant he was alvsys under surveil- '
Jance by suveral teams uf the KGB Seventh (Surveillance)
Directorete. The intensive coverage of ALIDIAN includdd
mail censorship, telephore taps, and agent rerorting; it was
instituted, NOSENKO said, ‘in the nose that he miyht lead
the KGB to anotner PCPOV." ABIDIAN was detected, NOSENKO
continued, in turee letter-mailirgs--all to agents already
under KGB control. ioe «as scen to enter a suspected deed
drop site on Pushhin Street, the significance of which dld
not become known to the KGB until later, snen it was learned

ripe

that this site sss to be used by PENFOVSAIY. In » hostile
interrogations of carty 1965, NOSENKO agreed ti was the

single person in the Kub responsible for kaosing everything
possible about ‘pIDIAN.

KOSENKO said he knew nothing abeut ARIDIAN's personal
background, his educatio!., his studies 1" France, his mili-
tary service, his date of entry into the State Nepartment,
his State Departnent rank, his previous foreign assignments
with the State Department, or his status as B& Foreign Ser-
vice Reserve, Staff, or Officer status (FER, FSS, FSO).

: NOSEXKO said he tried to learn these things, but the inforna-
i tion was uneavailavle in the Second Chief Directorate cr in

ene

KGB Central filcs. and although he requested information i
from the First Chier Directorate, nothing was received. The
only information the KGB had on ABIDIAY, insofar as NOSENKO

knew, was that contained in ABIDIAN's visa request and in

a report from one of the Legal Residencies in the United
States; the report provided a basis for believing him to be
a CIA officer.

! NOSENKO was unaware of the meaning of the initials i
FSR, FSS, and FSO. When asked whether he had checked the | ’
: Department of State Biographic Register for information on i :
i ABIDIAN's background, he replied the. this document was not
available to the U.S. Embassy Section; he subsequently
: recalled that there was an old copy of the Biographic Register

no information on ABIDIAN,

1959. NUSENKO never mentioned that KOSOLAPCY. whe oe
said was his immediete subordinate and shared SOSENKO'S
office in KGB Headquarters. was a member of this same
delegation.

NOSENKO did not know where ARIDIAN's office was Located
in the U.S. Exbagsy. We srid ne did not know and was
unable to find out who ARINIAN's secretary was. He reported
that some agent told the KG that ABIDIAN Fad a sign on
the door of his office which said "Security Officer."
There was no such sign. ,

SNOSENEO did not know where ARIDIAN'S apartuent was
locatcd. He did not knos its conteats and said that the
KGB was not interested in this. He did not «new whether
ABIDIAN changed apartments in Moscow, which re did.

NOSENKO ide::tified GROWAKOVA, an Enbassv language
teacher, aS a KO agent who was valuable because she was
intelligent and was able to provide persouality sketches on
her students Lased un classroon discussions. He never
associated ABIDIAN with GROMASUVYA. “en told that ABIDIAN
had taken Language lessons from ier. SOSLNKO recalled that
ABIDIAN took “severrnl” lessons from GHOMAKUVA at the beginning
of his tour but discontinued; she reported Lothing of sigii-
ficance and vhere wis no regular reporting froa her on
ABIDIAN. ABIDIAN, however, resorted that he took regular,
private Russian lessons frem GRUM (OVA throughout his tour
in Moscoe and that they discussed i: class his past personal
life, travel, education, fiancee, and his trips abroad to
see his fiancee.

NOSENKO knew that ABIDIAN travelled out of the USSR
two or three times, but had no idea when these trips took
Place or what countries ABIDIAN visited. NOSENKO said that,
as ABISIAN's predecessor LANGELLE wos known to have travelled
outside the USSR for operational reasons in consection with
the POPOV case, it would have teen of interest to learn
where ALIDIAN had gone, but the KG hal no way of finding
this out. (Note in the provious paragraph that CRkOMAKOVA
knew.) When NOSENKO'S interroyator pointed out the possibi-
lity of photographing ABIDIAN's passpore upon fis return to
tne USSR, NOSENKG replied that the \GB dues not photograph
ths passperts of foreign diplosais entering the soviet Union.

NOSENKO said that ABIDIAS sade no trips outside Moscor
within the USSk and explaired that. as case officer, he
would necessarily have Leen aware of any suck trip as he
would have had to Handle all arrangements for surveillance
during it. When NOSENKO was told that ABIDIAN travelled to
Soviet Armenia in October 1960. NOSENKO said fcr the first
time that he was on leave in that month. NOSENKO admitted
in October 1966 that he krew nothing of ABIDIAN's trip.

NOSENKO said that he did not know who were ABIDIAN's
close American friends in Moscow or his friends and profes-
sional contacts among foreigners therc.

MOSENKO said at the end of the January-February: 1965
interrogations concerning ABIDIAN that tie reason he knew
so little about ABIDIAN was because ne was “working badly"
as ABIDIAN's case officer. The reason for his poor work, he

pointing out that none ut all were mailed for a year and 2
half after the arrest of LANGELLEL in October 1959, (Xo
letters were mailed from 22 February 1960 until 1 April
1961, when ABIDIAN mailed his first one.) NOSENKO explained
that the KGB completely controlled this activity through the
use of metka, a thicf powder applied to the clothing of
foreigners in the USSR; a trace is lefr on anything coming
into contact with treated areas, and this can be detected
by spectal machines through which all mail passes. .Despite
the fact that all of ABIDIAN's letters wore mailed to KGB
double agents and would therefore have becr detected enyway,
it was metka, NOSESKO said, which in each case led to their
initial identification. After his defection NOSBNKO described
how the metka had becn applied to ABLUTAN's clothing (ane
hence tothe letters) ky the agent PLOOROVICH, aho began
working as ALIDIAN's maid several months efter ABJULAN er--
rived in Moscow in March 1300, NOSENKO insisted under inter-
rogation that FEDOROVICH was the paly agent who had access
to ABIDIAN's apartment, that he. NOSENKC, hed persenally
briefed her on the application of metka, and that he was
sure that ABIDEAN's letters wore defected by means of metka.
From a CIA debriefing of ABIDIAN, however, it appeats that
FEDOROVICH did not begin working as ABINIAN's maid until
Some time in July 1961, whereas ARIDIAN mailed his first
letter in Yoscow on 1 April 1961 and “is second Vetter on
2 July 1961. ABIDIAN's third letter was nailed on 1 Septem-

i. Reporting on ABIDIAN's Visit to the Pushkin Street Dead

NOSENKO’s account of the visit by ABIDIAY to the
PENKOVSKIY déad drop site on Pushkin Street in Mosocw is
described in detail on Pages 231-225. In summary. NGS ENKO
reported that at the end of 1560 or early 1961 KGB surveil-
lance followed ABIDIAN from the U.S, Embassy to Pushkin :
Street, where ABIDIAN was noted to enter a residential building.
Upon exanination it was decided that this was a likely
dead drop site, and a stationary surveillance post was as-
signed to watch it. After three months, since nothing sus-
picious had becn noted, this post was removed. ine true
significance of the location did not become known to the
KGB until after the arrest of PENKOVSKIY in 1962. NOSENZO
said he was still in the U.S. Embassy Section ard was ABIDIAN's
case officer when this event took place. He heard of it
while sitting in KOVSHUK's office on the day it haprened.
visited the site the following day with V. KOZLGV (Chief of
the Anericen Department of the KiB Surveillance Girectorate),
placed the original surveillance report in ABIDIAN's file,
and discussed the results of the stationary post with KOZLOV
on ar almost daily basis during the farst month acd periodi-
ecelly thereafter until the post was removed. It was KCZLOV

inspite the special eurveidilasec coverage of ACIOIAS,
NOSENKU shia, he was Usawnre of a” unusuak movements UF :
ABIDIAS during tne days immediately preceding his visit
io Pusakin Street.  SISENKO said thet be knew definitely
that surveillance had reported nothing unusual during this
period and that he was sure ABIDIAN had not eluded the sur-
veilia:ce at any time during it. According to CIA records,
three days before ABLUTAN wont to Fushnin Street in response
to indications tnat tne dead drop had beer loaded. AB1DIAN
left tne U.S. Embasyy in his private car for Spasew ifouse
at about mire o'clock in the evening: at about two o'clock
the next sorning he and GARELER (CIA Chief of Station} went
in ABIVIAN's car to check the t¢lephore pole fer the signal
PENKOVSKIY was to leave us part of his sizgral that the drop
had beca loaded. Two days before ABIDIAS went to Fushain
Street he drove nis car to the apartment of Air force Captain
DAVISON; he again checked the telepnone pole frum 4 widow
in the apartzent and then salked by it an foot. SOSENKO
identified GARBER as a U.S, navel officer but not as ea CIA
emploree (see above).

- Asked shy. in his opinion. ABILIAN went to Fustkin i
to . Street at the tite he did, NCSENKO replied that ia about
P6U an Anecrican iuurist or delegation mezber had gone to |
this address. It was the “opinion of the Secure Cuief
Directorate” that thas American had selected the site as a i
dead drop lucetion, end that ASIDIAN wert there serely
to check the suitability of the site for this purpose. In
fact, ABIDIAN scut tu Pushkin Street is response to what :
appeared to be & prearrenged telephone signal frea PENKOVSaAL®
: signalling that ae had loaded the dead dcrup there. It has
! been confirmed that FANKOVSKIY did not give this signal : t
t and, Lecsuse of the circumstances and type of signat given, |
the possibility of coincidence nas been ruted cut. CIA has
i therefore concluded that the signal came from the «KGB.

: The Pusakin Street dead drop site was proposed by :
i PENKOVSKIY himself in the August 1960 letter through which :
: he initially contacted CIA, There 18 110 record that a
“tourist or delegation neuber" visited this eddress. The
only known visit3 by Americans to the building on Fusbkin

i Decenber 1960 when the CIA officer MAHONEY checked the
eddress from outside, and on 21 January 12961 when MAHONEY
entered the building aad dhecked the specific Iecation of
the dead drop, AAHONEY is known to have been identified
to the KGB as a CYA officer before ariiving in “oscow ard
was tte target of heavy surveillance throughout his tour.

be said with certainty that NOSENKUO's ertire story of his
own participation in the surveillence of the Pushkin Street
dead drop sitc is false. NCSENKO: (a) couid not have

which GRYAZNOV held as of 28 December 1961; (c)} could not \

tions listed in the preceding paragraph wes the only poege of
a “protocol" waich NOSENKO refused to sign durirg the hostile
interrogations of early 1965. In October 1956, wnen he was

ber whether he had gone there at all.

j- Responsibility of Supervising Military Attache %perations

On 29 January 1965 NOSENKO told his interrogator that
for the first five or. six months of 1960, immediately after
transferring to tke U.S. Enbassy Section and as part of his:
responsibilities as its Deputy Chicf, he supervised Second
Chief Directorate activities against American service at—
taches in ¥oscow. Ey this. he meant, NOSENKO seid, that. when
GAVRILENKO (the case officer for Air Force Attaches),
KURILENKO (Army Attaches), or BELOGLAZOV (Naval Attaches and
Marines) had any questions or reports to submit, they would
come to him rather than to KOVSHUK, the Chief of the section,
After about six months he was relicved of this duty because
his other duties did not allow sufficient time for this
function and because it was considered more suitable that
ALESHIN, recently assigned to the American Department as
Deputy Chief, be given this responsibility.

NOSENKO -had previously been questioned in detail on
his resposibilities in the U.S. Embassy Section, and had never
before mentioned this one. NOSENKO told CI. in June 1964
that when he reported for duty tn the U.S, Embassy Section
in January 1960, DRANOV was the responsible case officer for
the Naval Attaches and Marines. Soon after his own arrival,
NOSENKO said, DRANOV was transferred from the section and
his reeponsibilities were taken over by BELOGLAZOV, who had
earlier been as=i:ting DRANOV against these targets.

NOSENKO said on 20 October 1966 that immediately upon,
or at the latest a few weeks after, arriving in the U.S.
Embassy Section, he went on leave for a month. Either
immediately before or right after this leave KOVSHUK told
him that he would be responsible for activities against
the Naval Attaches. DKANOV was retiring and gave NOSENKO
the files on Naval and Marine personnel. This was NOSENKO's
first mention either of the leave period in early 1960 or
of having had case officer responsibilities for personnel
of the Naval Attache's office in Yoscow. (At the same time
he said that he had lied about going on leave in November
1960.)

NOSENKO was reminded on 25 October 1966 that he had
said in 1965 that in 1960 he was supervisor of operations
against all U.S. service attache personnel. NOSESKO re-
plied: "I took the files only on the Navy, but I was working
on [supervising] all of thea."

KNOSENKO has never volunteered details of specific
operational activity he handled as the case officer for U.S.
Naval Attaches or supervisor of operations against all
attaches in early 1960. He said that Marine Colonel DULACKI's
contact with (or attenpt to recruit) the Indonesian KGB agent
which he has described in detail (see Page 488)
after he was relieved of these functions.

k. DY to Bulgaria and the LUNT Case

In the spring of 1261, NOSENKO said, four months after
returning from Cuba, he was told unexpectedly that. in. about ——.-
a week's time he would leave for Bulgaria to consult with F
the American Departnuent of the Bulgarian MVR concerning
operations against the American Legation in Sofia (Pages
279-283). NOSENKO flew to Sofia in early April 1961, where
he was met by A.S. KOZLOV, an advisor there and a former
employee of the Second Chief Directorate whom NOSENKO had
known at KGB Headquarters. NOSENKO remained in Bulgaria
until about the middle cf May. While there he discussed
both general matters and particular cases with the Bul- i
garians, gave several lectures on operations against Aneri-
can installations and personnel as well as against tourists, -
and finally directed the successful honosexual operation
against the American Professor LUST. :

wen ee apse

Aside from being told that he weuld be advising the
Bulgarian service on operations against Americans at the a ee .
Legation in Sofia, NOSENKO apparently received no preparae a
tion for this trip. He said in answer to specific questions '
that nobody told him what he was sunposed to discuss with:
the Bulgarians, that he did not meet with the Bulgarian
liaison representatives in Moscow before leaving, and that
he knew nothing of the organization, personnel, area of
responsibility, or problems of the American Department of
the Bulgarian service before arriving in Sofia.

NOSENKO was selected for this mission despite the fact
that he was extremely busy with his duties in the U.S. Exbassy
Sectien (see above discussion of his responsidilities for
code clerks, ABIDIAN, and the military attaches) and despite
the fact that KOZLOV was permanently assigned as an advisor
in Sofia. NOSENKO described XOZLOV in another context as a
"very experienced officer” and has said that KGZLOV was Chief
of the American Departeent until 1953 and then fron June 1955
until sometime in 1958 was Deputy Chief of the Tourist De-
partment, Second Chief Directorate. (KOZLOV, assisted by .
NOSENKO, had recruited BURGI in June 1956.) Asked why KOZLOV
could not have advised the Bulgarians, NOSENKO said that he
was too busy advising on higher levels and had been away
from active operations in Moscow too long. .

NOSENKO gave only a general description of his duties
as an advisor on operations against the American Legation.
On the other hand,:he accidentally became involved in a homo-.
sexual entrapment operation against an American tourist who
was visiting Bulgaria, and he has described this operation
in considerable detail. (NOSENKO's previous speciality was
tourist operations, particularly those involving homosexual
compromise.)

NOSENKO's story about his role in the LUNT case changed
greatly between 1962 and 1964. During the first meeting ~
series he described in detail how he set the operation up .
and what he said to LUNT when'he personally confronted the
American with the evidence. Since defecting in 1964, how-
ever, NOSENKO has said that he took no personal part in the
approach itself, that he remained in his office, and that he
merely advised how to set it up. (A comparison of his account
and that of LUNT indicates that he was not on the scene at
the time.)

- NOSENKO said that the Bulgarian service hecsne ay are
of LUNT's honosexual tendencies only after he saw LUNT's”
name or heatiit mentioned; he recognized the name as that..of
a professor who had been assessed as a homosexual when 4
carlier visiting Moscow, and traces with the KCB Second Chicf
Directorate confirmed that this was the same man. In state-
ments made to U.S. authorities after the approach, LUNT said
he had had horosexual relaticns at least five difrerent times
with a Bulgarian during in earlier trip to Sofia. LUNT
gave this Bulgarian travellers’ checks, which the latter
planned to sell cn the biackmarket, was on one occasion
stcpped on the sireet with Ain by a Sulxarian civil pelice-
man, and corresponded with him in the interim between his
first visit and rhe one during which the approach tock place.
LUNT had written the Kulesrian hemosexual that he was retyrning
to Sofia tefore arriving on the second occasion.

The U.S. Visa and the Cuba TvY

NGSENKO said that’ in October 1966 he was ussizned to
accompany a delegation of autonctive specialists cn a visit
to the United States but that when this trin was ceccelled,
he went on [DY to Cuba (lages 274-278). after he had com-
pleted arrangements for his passport and had submitted his
true name to the U.S. Embassy for a visa, the Soviets were
informed by U.S. authorities that the dclegation could not
then be accepted in the United States. At about the same
tine, a delegation of nickel industry experts was being
readied for departure to Cuba. At first, NOSENNG exptained,
it was not considered necessary for a security officer to
acconpany this delegation to a friendly country, but at the
last moment, two days before the delegation was scheduled to
leave Moscow, the Central Committee of the Comnunist Party
denanded that such an officer go along. Because there was
no tine to do otherwise, NOSENKO was chosen for this job
since he already had a valid passport and authorization. to
travel abroad. Visa arrangements were made for the transit
countrics and NOSENKO left with the delegation, returning to
Moscow in mid- or late December 1960.

NOSENKO's U.S. visa request submitted to the U.S. En-

bassy in Moscow on 29 October 1960 was his first use of this ‘

name in connection with travel abroad. (He travelled to
England in 1957 and 1958 as NIKOLAYEV, NOSENKO saiz, because
he had used this name with Eritish citizens 7
in the Soviet Union; a3 .aa Suspected ot veing an intel-
ligence officer, NOSENKO was exposed under this identity.

He applied for U.S. entry:under true name, however, cespite
the fact that he had also used the NIKOLAYEV nane with
Americans; one of them was FRIPPEL who, according to the
CHEREPANOV papers and one other source, wes suspected by the
KGB to be an American intelligence agent. NCSE®KO further
explained that he could not use the name NIKOLAYEV because
the automotive delegation cover he planned to use in the
United States conflicted with the sports/cultural cover he

had used in Great Britain, and the KGB feared that this.

would be ncticed when the Anerican and British services ex-
changed notes. The proposed automotive ‘cover, however, con-
flicts in the same way with the Ministry of Foreizn Affairs
cover NOSENKO used, again under true nane, in Geneva in 1962.

NOSENKO said that the decision to send him to Cuba
was made two days before the delegation left Moscow because
a security officer was required ard he happened to have a
passport and authorization to travel. ~The delegation left-—-
Moscow on 15 November 1960, and therefare ‘this cecision
was reached on 13 November or thereabouts. NOSENKO, who
had been transferred to the U.S. Embassy. Section in order
to supervise and revitalize operations against code clerks,
the Section‘s most important recruitment target, consequently
left Moscow on the day that MORONE also departed by train
for Warsaw and at a time thet his subordinate KOSOLAPOY was
in Helsinki (12-16 November 1960), apparently in connection

. with an operation against John GARLAND.

NOSENKO has given widely divergent accounts of the
purpose of his assignment to Cuba. In 1962 he related in.
detail how he had been sent to investigate how the Cuban—
intelligence service was operating against Americans stae
tioned in Havana, particularly intelligence officers. and
described what he did to fulftll this mission. Since 1964,
however, NOSENKO has claiaed merely to have been the security
officer with the delegation.

1. Personal Handlirg of Agents

When NOSENKO trassterred from the Tourist Department
to the American Departnent, he took along a nusber of the
agents he had used in tourlat operations with him: YEFREWOV
and VOLNOV, FRIPPEL, DMITRIYEVY, and 8YTOVA. Duriré this
period he also handled LEVINA, @ librerian and language—
teacher at the U.S. Enbassy who was turned over to him by

“y.S. Exbassy Section case officer MASSYA in 1960; and

PREISFREUND and who were usec in code clerk opera~
tions. These agents and NOSENKO'’s handling of them are dis-
cussed below.

account. The osly contact of the tso known to CIA sas 8

then, BARRETT ves recruited by the KGE on the basis of the
materials obtained in 1959, NOSENLO descrited the compro-
sise cf BARRETT in 1959 and knew that he had been recruited
in 1961. He did not know of BARRETT's contacts with YEFRE-
MOV and YOLKOV in 1961.

(11) FRIPPEL

XOSENKO said he continued to handle FRIPFEL during tie
19Gu-1961. period, despite the fact that he sever provided
anything of value, because he and CHELNOKOV (the Chief of
the Tourist Department who was always present at these
meetings) “kept hoping he would give something." FRIPPEL
left the Soviet Union in January 1961, but NOSENKO continued
to be registered as his case officer.

.

(iii) DMITRIYEV

DWITRIYEY, a specialist on Japan and Thailand who
spoke Japanese and English, had teen NOSENKO’s agent during
the 1955-1960 period. DUITRIYEV was then eaployed by the
Japanese Exhibition in Moscow, and NOSENKO did not indicate
how he was used in tourist operatious. NOSENXO did not
describe any operational use of hin in 1960 or 1961.

(iv) RYTOVA

RYTOVA was NOSENKO's agent in the Tourist Department
after 1956 or 1957, at which tize ghe was exployed at the
Russian Permanent Exhibit in Moscow. An English speaker,
she reported any interesting information concerning visitors
to the exhibition. NOSENKO has not referred to any KGB opere—
tions in Moscow in which she participated during his service
there.

(v) LEVINA
LEVINA worked as @ language teacher and librarian at

the American Enbassy and NOSENKO handled her because she
had a number of code clerks in her language classes. He

Enbassy ut the end of 1960 or early 1951.

(vi) Johen PREISFREUND

As described in Pages 173-131 and discussed above,
PREJSFREUND was, NOSENKO seid, recruited by KOVSHUK in 1960
ard was hacdied vy NOSENKO in the operation against Jamcs
STORSBERG. Doth NOSLNKO and PREISFREUKD seid thet this vas
the only operation in which he took part. NOSENKO Buggested '
to CIA that PREISFREUND would be able to attest to his "G
description of this case, and CIA interviewed PRELSFREUND :
in Helsinki and Stockhola during the sucmer of 1965. PREIS- > s
FREUND's account generally agreed with SOSENKO's ond be was CC
able to supply a considerable anount of personsiity and
background information concerning his former case officer.
From PREISFREUND's manner during these intervieyrs, the nature
of his responses and statements, and his sections after the
interviews were completed, there was ho reesonosble doubt
that ho remaincd under KGB control while meeting the CIA

«. Transfer to the Tourist Department

Some time in the fall of 1961, NOSENKO said, he heard
of GRIBANOV's decision to promote himto the position of
Deputy Chief of the eatire American. Department. NOSENKO, -..--
however, knew that his chief and friend KOVSHUX wanted the
job. and that FEDOSEYEV (Chief of the Department) also favored
KOVSHUK for this position. Realizing that his own appoint~
ment would therefore place him in a difficult position and
wishing to avoid this, NOSENKO spoke to the Chief of the
Tovrist Department, CHELNOKOV, about returning there. At
CHELNOKOV's suggestion, NOSENKO went to GRIBANOV with the
request to be returned to the Tourist Department as Chief _
of-the American Tourist Section, with the understanding that
he would be made Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department
upon the retirement of the incumbent. BALDIN, in July 1962.
To this GRIBANOV agreed. NOSENKO said that GRIBANGV did

- not discuss with himhis reasons for wanting to appoint him

Deputy Chief of the American Department or for appointing
him Chief of the American Tourist Section, nor did ne discuss
with NOSEXKO his personal requirements for these positions.
On one occasion, in early 1965, NOSENKO said that it was
because GRIBANOV "thought I was a tough guy, a good case
officer. In 1959 I saw him often and was involved ir a lot.
of questions which were reported to him." According to

his most recent version, NOSENKO was officially transferred
from the American Départment at the end of December 1961
and reported for duty in the Tourist Department on about

3 January 1962. :

KOVSHUK, who was also a candidate for the job as Deputy
Chief of the American Department, had earlier held this po-
sition, according to NOSENKO and COLITSYN. He had been per-
sonally involved in many of the nore significant American
Department operations during the previous decade. These in-
cluded the recruitments of RHODES and SMITH (the latter one
of NOSENKO's most inportant leads. according to NOSEXKO);
the handling of ‘SHAPIRO; the attempts to recruit STORSBERG, .

STONE, and MANNHEIM; the development of the CIA officer
W1 ERS;) acd the interrogation of LANGELLE in connection with
he POPOV arrest.

By contrast. GRIBANOV's original candidate for*the job,
NOSENKO, was present when KOZLOV recruited BLPGI,;and himself
recruited HARRIS) and five homosexual tourists who visited
the Soviet Union in 1959: Furthermore, NOSENKO's perfor-
mance as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section. as he
admitted under interrogation, was "not good.”

. NOSENKO has given many contradictory dates for his
transfer to the Tourist Department. In 1962 NOSENKO said

_at various times that this took place in January 1962 and

in February 1962: in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling
some time between 15 and 20 January 1962; and in February
1965 he arrived at the date of 2 or 3 Janvary 1962, after

it was pointed out that he appeared in the approach to W.E. .
JOHNSON on 5 January; (On this basis, he said that the
official order was issued about 25 December 1961 and that

he turned over his files to his successor GRYAZNOV several
days later.) NOSENKO contradicted this latter estimate.
however, by saying that he was in the U.S. Embassy Section
for the entire period of the three-month surveillance of

the Pushkin Street dead drop, i-e-, until late March 1962,
and by his insistence that he had returned to the Tourist
Department by the time GOLITSYN defectud; he placed this on |
15 January 1962 and refused to believe the correct date of
15 December 1961. :

p. Remarks

For no single responsibility has NOSENKO substantiated
hie alleged service as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy
Section in the vears 1960-1961. His statements about the
appointment to and transfer from this position have been
inconsistent; bis comparatively narrow experience and his
acknowledged falsehoods about a personal relationship with
the Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, GRIBANOV,
dispel the likelihcod that these personnel assignments were
made in the way he claims. Repeatedly he has been contra-
dictory about his activities during this two-year period,
shifting his story to suit the occasion and ignoring how
each succeeding version made all of his claims increasingly
incredible. The Limited extent of NOSENKO's information
betrays a lack of familiarity with details on the duties,
targets, and most of the cperations which he has ascribed
to hinself; in a certain few instances, however, such as
his description of “ABIDIAN's route to the Pushkin Street dead
drop, he has recounted events just as they are known from
other sources to have occurred. Nevertheless, where col-
lateral information has covered the few subjects on which
he provided details, it has almost invariably contradicted
him and showed hin to be ignorant of significant facts.

The reporting by NOSENKO thus was so superficial, so in-
ete, and go demonstrably erroneous as to suggest. without _
. reservation that he never eerved as.an.officer in the U.S._.

conpl'
Embassy Séction, such less ag its Deputy .Chief.. All avail-

7. Tourist department (1962-1964)

a. Introduction

NOSLNKO agreed during the interrogations at the beginning
of 1965 that ho must have reported for duty as Chief of the
- American Tourist Section on about 3 January 1962.* In this
job he was responsible for planning and supervising KGB acti-
vities against all tourists of American, British, and Canadian
nationalities arriving in the USSR, and his duties also encom-
passed preparations for the coming tourist season (Pages 225-
287).

In July 1962, in conformity with GRIbANUV's intentions,
NOSENKO was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief of the
entire Tourist Department; it had a table of organization of
close to 1060 staff officers, was responsible for handling cpera~
tions against all tourists to the Soviet Union, and maintained
the facilities used in these operations. A year later NOSENKO
veceived the title of First Deputy Cnief of the Department, a
“paper” promotion as there was no other deputy. During this
pericd in the Tourist Department, in addition to his supervi-
sory duties (concerning which he has not been questioned in
detail), NOSENKO took personal part in approaches to several
tourists, organized and directed the arrest of an American
tourist on homosexual charges, and met with a number of agents.
It was his serior supervisory position that involved him in two :
of the most widely publicized cases of this pericd, the arrest
of BARGHOORN. and the case of OSWALD.

b. Absences from Moscow

During his two years in the Tourist Department, NOSENKO
was available to perform his assigned duties only part of the
time. ‘After arriving in the American Tourist Section and after
‘the approach to JOENSON on 5 January 1962, NOSENKO spent sev-
eral weeks “getting the feel" of things by talking to case offi-
cers, reviewing reports of the section's activities during the
previous two years, and discussing plans for the up-coming tour-
ist season. In mid-February he began preparations for his assign-
ment to Geneva with the Disarmament Delegation. NOSENKO has
said that this involved discussions with the Eleventh Depart-
ment of the Second Chief Directorate, responsible for arranging
for security coverage of Soviet delegations going abroad, as i
well as with the case officers responsible for the investigation ae
of suspected American agent SIIAKHOV. NOSENKO said that he did~ H
this on a part-time basis in addition to his regular duties,
but has noted in another context that these preparations required
sufficient time to make it impossible for him to take a personal
part in the recruitment of BIENSTOCK in February 1962. On
15 March 1962, NOSENKO arrived in Geneva, remaining there with
the delegation until 15 June, when he left Geneva by train to
return to Moscow to reassume his duties as Chief of Section.
(He said that he had no deputy chief in this position, and it
is unclear who performed these functions in his absence.) Thus,
according to NOSENKO's account, of the six months he was Chief

of the Americen Tourfst Section, he wis in Moscow only three”
months ard for much of this time was involved in breaking in
on his new job or in preparing for his temporary assignment —
abrozd. NOSIKO said ne hed “no accomplishments” in this '
period. a :

In the fall of 1962, NOSEXKO went on leave for a month in”
Sochi with his wife end mother. WOSENKO has estimated that 31x
months of 1963 were spent cn various temporary assignments in
the Soviet Union outside cf Moscow, plus a one-nonth's vacation
in 153. From 15 June 1962 to ns arrival in Geneva en 19 Janu-
ary 1964, a period of 18 months, OCENKO was absent from KGB
Headquerters for eight months. Tres in the period 1962-63,
holding supervisory pysitions, NOSEUKO was absent or “reading
in" for about 13 months, cr akout £0 percent of the time.

c. Personal Participal.ion in Cperations

NOSENKO had direct operational corzact with three Americans
during 1962 and i963. Two of these (the approach to JOHN SCN
and the interrogation of hbatSHOCIe) were unusual an that they
were provocations without any attempt to recruit the target;
NOSEUKO could nane no cther examples of. such operations. In
both cases, the victim of the provocation has verified NOSENKO'Ss
presence. The third case, the recruitment approach to BRAUNS,
was unsuccessful, Additionally, NOFFNKO supervised the homo-
sexual compromise ot KCTEN, who was closely tied in with gipgeaee

sensitive seurce and related.

(1) The W.E. JCHNSON Provocation

JOHNSON (Pages 289-293), NOSEXKO said, was in Moscow as

a tourist in early January 1962. ard was considered for recruit-

ment, but a decision was made thet he was net worth the efZort

as he had no access to classifies aateriats and lived too tar
: frem the KG8 Legal Residencies in Washington and New York City. i
: (JCHNSON's home was in Texas.) Severai days after this deci-
: sion was made, postal intercepts showed that JCENSON was writing
abusive letters concerning the Soviet Union. They were "so
bitter" and critical that the KGB decided that something had
to be done to stop him, At about the same time the KGB received
an indication that JOHNSON was a remosexual, and it was decided #
to entrap him on this basis and force him to promise not to :
write any more letters or criticize the USSR in articles when
jhe returned to the United States. The compromise was effected
by use of NOSENKO'S homosexual asents, and NCSENKO was able to A
describe the confrontation scene, his second meeting with JOHN-"
SON; and JOHNSON's frightened telephone call to the U.S. Enbassy
reporting that NOSENKO had recortacted hin.

this operation “in January." When he contacted CIA in Geneva

| in 1964 he had a scrap of paper on which was noted JOHNSON 's

i name and the date "5 January 1962." Tnis was the actual date
of the approach, but NOSENKO insisted that the date bore no
relationship to the name, and that the approach to JOHNSON took

place in the summer of 1962, a fact he recalled distinctly be-
cause he wore no overcoat. It was only when confronted with
official U.S. records that NOSENKO agreed in early 1965 that
the appreach was in January and recalled that it was made
immediately after NOSENKO returned to the Tourist Department.*

NOSENKO said that when JOHNSON first arrived in Moscow
there was consideration of recruiting him, but that there was
a decision against this as he was of litcle intelligence value.
Then JOHNSON mailed insulting letters which were picked up
through postal intecept. About the same time there were indi-
cations of homosexuality. Then the operation was mounted
“against him. This implies a very tight time schedule. JOHNSON .
arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961; NOSENKO said he reported Lo
for duty as Section Chief on 3 January 1962; JOHNSON reported .
hia first contact with NOSENKO'S homosexual agent VOLKOV the ‘
evening of 4 January; and the approach by NOSENKO was on 5 Janu- :

ary.’

Ne RAS Sal eng Sica tae

Although NOSENKO implied in 1962 that his homosexual agents
VOLKOV and YEFREMOV: were the ones who originally determined
1 JOHNSON "s| homosexuality, he said in 1964 onjy that there were
“"gigns.” ~NOSENKO did not know what these indications were or ;
where they came fron. JOHNSON reported that he first met the :
agent VOLKOV on the evening of 4 January when the latter sat
down at his restaurant table; on this same occasion VOLKOV in-
vited JOHNSON to nis hotel room the next day. The fact that
VOLKOV joined JOHNSON uninvited and set him up for the approach
without leaving the table suggests that there had, in fact,
been signs of his homosexuality beforenand and that operational
plans had been laid by this time.

NOSENKO has described the caution taken in other homosexual
entrapment cases and has named several which were called off
because of a risk of scandal, It is, therefore, unusual that
the KGB would take this risk merely to force JOHNSON, an
American and a Baptist minister, to stop writing insulting let-
ters and articles. . .

NOSENKO did not know why he became involved in this opera-

:. tion the’day after he reported for duty in the senior position

of Section Chief. He gaid only that BOBKOV, a Deputy Chief of
the Stcond Chief Directorate, told him to do it. During his
talks with JOHNSON, NOSENKO introduced himself to JOHNSON as

"Georgiy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV," (rendered by JOHNSON as NIKOLOV)

the "Chief of Police." :

City as a result of >: the fFlasring
of the provocation, ob ts S nj BAIGHDORN
which were not related to the pr BANGHOORN'S arrest |
in Moscow, and the early stag?3 of his interrogation. Except
for sone variaticn in datcs, MOSENKO's accounts of BARGHOJRII's ©
movements and ofthe, sequence of events in the provocatioa-
arrest matched that of BARGHOOR'. This case is in two way3
similar to the approach to W.E. JONNSON: It was an operation
in which there was_no thought of recruitment, and BARGHOOF was
able to identify NOSENKO as a perticipant.

BARGHOORN reported that the day after his arrest he was
questioned by the same officer who had interrogated him the
evening before abcut the "compromising materials" which had
been planted on hin. With this officer on this one occasion
was his “chief,” whom BARGHOORN subsequently identified by photo-
graph as NOSENKO. NOSENKO has said that he was told.by the
Chief of the Tourist Department that GRIBANOV wanted him (SOSENKO)
present in the interrogation room at the time when BARGHOOPN
admitted that he had the. conpromising information in his posses-
pion at the time cf arrest. NOSENKO did not knew why hig pir-
ticular presence was needed or desired, tut he complied deszite
the fact that he did not want to reveal hig face to BARG!HOOPN
as he knew BARGHOORN would be released. NOSENKO said that he
stayed in the interrogation room only vatil the interrogating
officer secured this admission ana then he left. BARGHOCRU
has reported that NOSENKO attended one of the interrogaticn
sessions, that thzs session covered only biogrepnic and background
matters, and that the ccmpromising docurents and his possession
of them had been discussed the previous evening, right after his

arrest.

In deseribing the planning of this provecaticn, NOSENXKO
told CIA that the suggestion to provide BARGHOOSN came fren
GRIBANOV, who took the jdea of arresting BARGHOOKN to KGB Chair-
man SEMICHASTNYY, Dut did not divulge t> him thet it would be.
based on provocation. ‘his was on the day before the arrest.
SEMICHASTNYY agreed with the idea of the arrest ard secured
permission to carry it out from BREZHNEV, a5 KHRUSHCHEV was
out of Moscow at the time. Reliable scurces show, however,
that KHRUSHCHEV was in Mcscow on 30 October, the day when SEMI-
CHASTNYY allegedly called BREZHNEV, and was also there on 31
October, the day cf the arrest. BREZHNEV was not seen by
Westerners in Moscow from 29 October until 2 November 1963.

"(iii) The Approach to BRAUNS

NOSENKO said he personally approached the American tour-
ist BRAUNS (Pages 293-295) shortly after returning to Moscow
from Geneva in 1962. BRAUNS had lived in Leningrad until World
War II, had left with the fleeing Germans, and had eventually
settled in the United States, where he was a technician working
at an “interesting company making computers, adding machines,
or other instruments." NOSENKO had originally instructed his

subordinate KRUPNOV to handle the case, but KRUPNOV was not able
to get anywhere with BRAUNS. and in the middle of the approach
called NOSENKO fcr help. NOSENKD went to the Mcscow Hotel where
KRUPNOV and BRAUNS were talking, and he eventually secured:
ERAUNS! agreement to ccoperate, against threat of imprisonment
for treason on the basis of hie wartime flight from the Soviet
Union. BRAUNS. left Moscow tha next day for Leningrad, and be-
Cause NOSENKO felt the recruitment was “shaky,” KRUPNOV was ©
sent after him to consolidate the agreenent. BPAUNS refused

to see KRUPNOV however, 80 again NOSENKO went to help hin. It
was clear to NOSENKO, however, that BRUNS was 8° frightened
that he would never work for the KGB; NOSDNKXO thereupon decided
to terminate the case, and BRAUKS wad sent on his way.

NOSENKO could not recall his position at the cine he approached
BRAUNS, he did not know why SRAUNS had visited th. Soviet Unicn,
and he was unable to name any Soviet citizens with whom BeAUNS
came into contact while in the USSP. BRAUNS, in fact, had spent
almost a week in Moscow before the approacu was mace.. During
thie time’ he spent his days with an Inturise tour and his even-
ings with an old girlfriend he had knows Eefore the war. She
had been writing to BRAUNS in che United States for about a year,
telling him of her unheppy marriage and itpending divorce.

[DRAUNS hed written her cf his intention to visit the USSR, and
she travelled specially from her hene in tenincrad to Moscow to
spend this time with hin.

According to the account given by BRAUNS, the man (NOSENKO,
accerding to NOSENKO) who jcined him and nis original interrc~
gator in Moscow was the person who first epproached him in Lenin-
grad. This suggests, if correct, that it was NOSENKO who was
sent there to consolidate the recruitment, aot KRUPHOV. BRAUNS
was unable to-identify NOSiNKO's photograph but expiained that
he was so frightened that he probably cculd not recognize any-
one involved. Other aspects of his story therefore may be ccr-
fused.

(iv) The Arrest of KOTEN

NOSENKO said he supervised the homosexual provecation anc
arrest of American tour guide KOTEN in 1963 and the develop-
ments in the case were reported to him (Pages 298-302); he was
not in face-te-face contact with KOTEN. WOSENKO explained that
KOTEN, a member of the CPUSA, had freccently visited the USSR
since the war, he numerous suspicicus contacts there, and was
considered possibly to be a “plant” (presumably of the Fal) ir.

Se Copmunist Party. Prior to his arrival in’1963, GER ode

with an r=portant 2o%eseat in ‘ that he was carrying

FOTEN was 4 long-tine Cormanist, ani there are no apparent
reasons why the KGB should doubt his loyalty. Wis homogexuality
was well-known to his acquaintances within the CPUSA, and at
the time of his trip to the Soviet Union he was acting as a tour

vide for the New York firm “Afton Tours," which is owned by
SVEXCHANSKIY. (NOSENKO said that SVENCHANSKIY, also a Conneist,
was his. own agent at the time of KOTEN's arrest.)

The fact that KOTEN had been arcested on chargas of homo-
sexuality was leaked by Inturist to press services two days
after the reported date of the arrest, resulting in wide pub-
licity in Western newspapers. (ha U.S. Smbassy was nc” noti-
fied officially until cwo days later.) There was no apparent
reasen for this extrenciy unusurl step by the KG3, which can

be assumed to manipulate Inturist for operaticnal support pur-

poses.

After the CPUSA had protested the action, KOTEN was re=

which had been corrected, that he was free co go anywhere he

When NOSENKO transferred from the U.S. Embassy Section to
the Tourist Department, he took with him the two homesexual
agents VOLKOV dnd YEFR=MOV, PREISFREUND, BREW, and RYTOVA
(Pages 287-289). The homosexuals he used the day after his
return, in the operaticn against W.E. JCHNSON. This was their
first operational use since the fall of 1953; they were never
used again before being terminated at the end of 1962 or early
1963, NOSENKO said, because they were "too well known." PREIS-
FREUND was considered compromised to Rmerican Intelligence
following the defection of GOLITSYN, so he also was never used
again, although NOSEKKO met him socially when PREISFRECND re~
turned to Moscow on business trips as recently as 1963. During
the first part of 1962, on instructions from KOVSHUK and the
NOSENKO continued te meet
with who was still involved in the development of ZUJUS,
the American code clerk. NOSENXO lest saw tefore going
to Geneva in March 1962; WEISS left ‘he Soviet Union to return
to Syria while NOSENKO was away. ‘RYTOVA, NOSENKO said, had
been his agent since 1956 or 1957. Some time in 1962 she moved
from her position as an instructor of Greek at the Institute

of International Relations to a position in the school of the
CPSU Central Committee and ceased agent work. Althozgh she
was inactive, NOSENKO continued to be registered as wer case
officer until 1964, when he defected. .

(4) PRIPPEL
Having left his assignment in Moscow in early 1961, PRIPPEL

(Pages 129-133° and’ Pary VIJI.D.5.) returned several times to

the Soviet Union in 1962 and 1963. NOSENKO, who remained his
case officer although PRIPVEL now lived and worked in New York
City, met him each time. FRIPFEL said there were three such —
occasions, in February 1962 when he met once with NOSEUKO and
CHELNOKOV in Odessa, and two later times in Moscow and Odessa,
when NOSENKO came alone. NOSENKO denied that he met PRIPPEL

in Odessa in February 1962 with CHELNOKOV, but said that he met
twice with him alone after returning to Moscow from Geneva. ,
The first of these meetings was in the summer of 1962 when FRIP~
PEL was accompanying a group of American newspaper editors tour-
ing the Soviet Unicn. FRIPPEL said NOSENKO called briefly at
his hotel room to enquire what questions ‘the editors planned

to ask KHRUSHCHEFV during a planned interview. When FRIPPEL

‘ gaid he did not know, NOSENKO departed and FRIPPEL later re-

ported that he did not see NOSENKO again on this trip. (NOSENKO
gaid he called again after the interview to learn the “reactions”
of the editors.) The second meeting was in Odessa, when FRIPPEL,

_ visited the Soviet Union as a guide on a tour ship. According

to FRIPPEL, it was on this occasion that NOSENKO apparently made
a phone call to ask permission to go aboard FRIPPEL's ship, and
it might have been at this meeting or the earlier one that
NOSENKO told him something of his personal background. (FRIPPEL
knew a considerable amount of information about NOSENKO's father
and family.) NOSENKO denied the possibility that he would have
to request permission to board the vessel and said that if he
had told FRIPPEL anything about himself, it was when’ he was
drunk. Both FRIPPEL and NOSENKO agreed that FRIPPEL provided
no information of value during any of these meetings. .

(ii) SVENCHANSKTY

NOSENKO has cited SVENCHANSKIY, KGB cryptonym *ANOD,” as
an example of the Second Chief Directorate's use of foreign
travel agents to signal the KGB when an interesting tourist is
about to visit the Soviet Union (Pages 295-298). SVENCHANSKIY
was recruited for this purpose, NOSENKO said, in 1961 and used
to send open-code signals to the Tourist Department by marking
visa applications whenever he spotted anything significant.
Some of SVENCHANSKIY's signals had been, considered, NOSENKO
said, “of definite operational interest." In September 1963,
NOSENKO took the case over from the previous handling officer,
NOSKOV, and his name was listed in SVENCHANSKIY's file as the

responsible officer.

NOSENKO first said that he had read SVENCHANSKIY's file
and then changed this to say that he had only skimmed it. He
met twice with his new agent, once in September 1963 and once
Jater in the year. On both occasions, NOSKOV was present.

in 1961 that, because SVENCHANSKIY was known ‘o have had con- ,
tacts with AMTORS in New York, there was some suspicion that ve
he mignt be an FBI agent. NOSENKO was unable to be more pre- ~
cise as to tna basis for these suspicions and, when asked how ;
NOSKOV had resolvec them, was able to say only that NOSKOV .
*felt" that SVENCHANSKIY was not an American agent. . a \

NOSENVO said that at the time SVENCHANSK1Y vas recruited : t
. '

{

t

NOSENKO knew little about SVENCHANSKIY's background from
the one-volume file kept on him in the Tourist Department: He
did know that SVENCHANSKIY was recruited in 1961 on the promise
of commercial favors, that he had 2t one time been detected .
in blackmarket transactions in the USSR, and that in addition 1
to his travel agency, SVENCHANSKIY ran a Russian-Language book- i
atere in Chicago. FBI and CIA records show that SVENCHANSKIY f
has becn employed by 4 series of registered Soviet Government {
organizations in the United States since the early 1930's, :
that he was released from his position as a United Nations radio
officer broadcasting to the Soviet Union in 1952 when he failed
to answer questions of the Senate Interna] Security Comittee
concerning alleged subversive activity, and that both his travel :
agency and his book store are affiliated with registered Sov- ;
iet agencies, Inturist and Mezhkniga. Allegation3 on file of
SVENCHANSKIY's Communist sympathies and probable Soviet espion-
age activities date back to the Second World War. In August
1950, Harry GOLD jinked SVENCHANSRIY to the Soviet espionage
network in the Unites States during the wa The FBI has re-

* eMCentariea abs fa aesne time been the :
ceftidential secretary of GOLOS, the “director of Soviet espion- :
age in the United States.” (NOSENKO knew that someone called
Sonya worked for SVENCHANSKIY in New York, but said that she
is not a KGB agent and was not the one who marked the visa

‘ applications.)

EN MEN os

e. The OSWALD Investigation

As First Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, NOSENKO —
said, he was directiy involved in the investigation of OSWALD's
. activities in Minsk which was ordered after the assassination
id of President KENNEDY (Pages 136-144 and Part VIII.D.5.). It
' is from his role at this time and his reading of the Minsk KGB
file on OSWALD that NCSENKO derived his authority to state that
the KGB "washed its hands of OSWALD® after his attempted sui-
cide in the USSR, that there was no attempt to recruit either
: - OSWALD or his wife, and that KGB interest in OSWALD while he
: lived in Minsk was restricted to passive observation. ;

g- Remarks

Leaving aside NOSENKO’s unsubstantiated claims to puper-
visory jobs in the ‘tourist Department in 1962-1953, when he
indicated he was absent fros KGB Headquarters nearly half of .
the time, his persorsl rote in operations and investigations
of the period appears artificgal in some instances and im- :
plausible in others. KOSENKO’s knowledge of the origins of
the JOHNSON case is incomplete, the timing conflicts with other
activities attributed to himself, the expressed purpose of
tne compromise in unique, and the outcome seems to have little
consequence beyond enabling JOHNSON to confirm that NOSENKO
appeared in it. Although BRAUUS may have been in a position
to corroborate NOSExKO's appearance in that operation, he has
rot done so and his statesents contradict NOSENKO on the part :
the latter playcd. So too do the statezents of BARGHOORN, who f° i
recognized NOSENKO as a person who was seen briefly during the : :
interrogation sessions; certain facts from other sources con=
tradict NOSENKO on one important cetail (KERUSHCHEV’s presence

In summary, NO ENKO'S operational work was not commensurate
with that of a Section Chief and Deputy Department Chief, nor
with that of a case officer, regardless of rank. Where the
participation of NOSESKO in Tourist Department activities has
been or might be coafirmea by other sources, it is therefore

- unproven that he was in a supervisory position in the KGB or Cc. ;
that he was even a case officer. :

B. Examination of Other Aspects of NOSENKO's Biography

1. KGB Awards and Ranks

a. Awards

At various times since contacting CIA in 1962, NOSENKO
described a series of awards and decorations which he received
over the years for his performance of duties in the Second Chief
Directorate (Pages 319-321). lie claimed to have received the
Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Star, and the Order of the
Red Banner; he said he received a special commendation from
KGB Chairman SEROV for nis role in the BURGI recruitment and
the same award in 1959 for his recruitment of all of the Ameri--
can or British tourists recruited that year by the KGB (three
British and three American homosexuals). NOSENKO told of a
number of other commendations which he received--almost one a
year--for his “general good work." In October 1966 NOSENKO
said that he never received any awards for his KGB operational
performance, only a medal for satisfactcry completion of 10
years of KGB service and a Red Army anniversary medal.

b. Ranks

NOSENKO's descriptions of his various rank promotions fol-
low a similar but more complicated pattern (Pages 322-326).
He has given two separate sets of circumstances for his first
promotion, frem junior lieutenant to lieutenant. According to
the first of these, the one NOSENKO adhered to during 1964 and
1965, he was promoted to che rank of lieutenant while serving
in the Far East with the naval GRU at the beginning of 1951.
NOSENKO explained =hat the required time in grade is scmetimes
cut in half for cfficers serving at this undesirable post, and
that this is why he was promoted after only six months of
active duty. In 1966 NCSENKO said for the first time that he
did rot enter on active duty until March 1951 and that his
promotion to lieutenant was in mid-1952, while stationed in
Sovetsk, on the Baltic. In all his accounts, HNOSENKO has said
that he entered the KGB with the zank of lieutenant as this
had been his rank in the naval GRU.*

During his first meetings with CIA in Geneva during 1962
NOSENKO claimed then to be a KGB major and said that he had
already completed the necessary time in grade for a lieutenant
colonelcy. NOSENKO gave an apparently accurate description
of the structure of his salary as 4 major (so much for rank,
go much for longevity, etc.) and pointed out that he was fill-
ing a position (Chief of Section) normally held by a lieutenant
colonel. On contacting CIA again in 1964, NOSENKO claimed the
rank of lieutenant colonel. He supported this claim with the
@DY authorization issved for the CHEREPANOV search, *™. which

gave NOSENKO's rank as lieutenant colone’ and was signed by
GRIBANOV himself and testified to it by his signature on the
“official biographical stetement" prepared in Frankfurt.

The first major change in NOSENKO's story of his promo~
ticns came during the interrogations of Jenuary 1965 when he
volunteered out of context and for no clear reason that he hed
never held the rank of major but rather, because of a series
of administrative slip-ups and GRIBANOV's advize and help, had
jumped cirectly from the rank of captain, which hs received
in 1956, to the rank of lieutenant colonel in late 1963.
NOSENKO was later to claim that he had never said in 1962 that
he was a@ major.*

‘.
:

In. an unsolicited statenent given to CIA in April 1966,
NOSENKO wrote that he was only a captain and that the TDY authori-
zation for the CHEREPAXOY search had been filled out in error.

ce. xkemarks

NOSENKO's admissions regarding his awards and promotions
directly affect his self-portraiture as a successful and rapidly :
rising KGS officer. They also have a beari F the
alleged reasons for this rise it was
GRIBANOV's favoritism. NOSEN : nxed GRI-
BANOV'’s name to each cf the awards he earlier claimed to have
received. In most cases it was GRIBANOV who ceCided that
NOSENKO should get a particular award; in the rest, it was
GRIBANOV who physically presented the award to NCSENKO. The
same is true of NOSENKO's account of his rank premotions:
GRIBANOV, NOSENKO said, had promised him that he would be pro-
moted Girectly from senior lieutenant to major in 1959; when
the Personnel Department made a mistaxe and cnly promoted
NOSENKO to captain, GRILANOV adviscd him to accept this rank
and promised that when he had conpleted sufficier.. time in grade
for promotion to major, GRIBANOV would sce to 2% that he was
promoted directly to lieutenant colonel. ‘his is what happened,
NOSENKO said in 1965, and after he received his rank of Lieu-
tenant colonel, GRIBANOV called him in and congratulated him.
On the basis of NOSENKO's admissio.s, there is additional rea-~
son to quegtion his relationship with GRIBANOV.**

ca me ere

NOSENKO carried with him to Geneva, against HG2 regulation |
and for no reason he could explain, an official KCB document |
listing him as a lieutenant colonel and signed by GRIBANOV hin- H
self as well as by two provincial authorities. This suggests i
strongly that’ the lie concerning NOSENKO's rank was not NOSEKNKO'S {
alone. (If, in fact, as pointed out above, the CHEREPANOV
_ papers were fabricated by the KGB, then there was no genuine search
te for CHEREPANOY and NOSENKO's cocument is also fabricated’ and i
: not a mistaxe as NOSENKO claims.) . . i

2. Affiliation with Communist Party Organs

a. Introduction

NOSENKO drifted into the Komsomo., he said, in 1943 or
1944 without giving the step any thought whatsoever. All of
his friends at the Baku school were joining, so NOSENKO did
too. He remained an indifferent member of this Communist
youth organization throughout his school and university years,
in the GRU, and during his first year as a KGB officer. On
arriving in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Depart-
ment in 1953, NOSEXKO told CIA, he was appointed Secretary of
the small Komsomol Organization of the Second Chief Director-
ate, a group of about 17 members.

b. Discussion

NOSENNO was questioned by DERYABIN on his duties as Kom-
somol Secretary (Pages 623) ani, although able to give a super-
ficial account of these functions, was fecund to be unaware of
certain basic information which DERYABIN felt a person in this
position should have. Thus, for example, NOSiNKO provided a
description of the system of levying dues on Kemscmol members
which was substantially incerrect and was unaware that a Kom~
somol Congress (the first in many years and therefcre a major
event) had been held curing his claimed tenure as Secretary.

NOSENKO said that he held the position of Komosmol Organi-
zation Secretary until the late spring or early summer of 1954,
when he got into trouble for naving used official KGB alias
documentation to conceal the fact that he received treatment
for venereal disease contracted from a prostitute. Immediately
aiter this incident, said NOSENKO, he wag removed from nis
position and a “strict reprimand" was placed in his Kom-
somul file. Several months thereafter, on the eve of his 27th
birthday, NOSENKO was forced out of the Komsomol because he was
too old. For over a year, until January 1956 when NOSENKO was
admitted as a candidate member of the Communist Party cf the

~ Soviet Union, he was the only officer in the KGB who was neither
_a Komsomol nor a Party member. NOSZNKO's accourt of his expul-

sion from the Komsc=zol on reaching his 27th birthday is con-
tradicted by the official Statutes of the Komsomol in effect

at that time. These regulations stipulate a meximum age of

25 years and NCSENKO should therefcre have been forced cut at
the end of October 1953, upon reaching his 26th birthday. This
was explained to NOSENKO, who insisted that he remained a member
until he became 27 years old and that no special exceptions
were made in his case.

ce. Remarks

The fact that NOSENKO is incorrect regarding the age limi-
tation makes it doubtful that his account of the venereal
disease incident and his removal from the Komsomol Secretary-
ship is true. The date which he gives to this incident is
after that on which he should have been expelled from the Kom=
somol. (Additionally, NOSENKO's descriptions of the veneral
disease incident, his use of false documents, and his subsequent
punishment by the kGB and the Komsomol have been inconsistent;
see Pages 80-81).

The evidence that NOSENKO lied about this particular
aspect of his first tour in the U.S. Embassy Section further
suggests that his entire account for this period of his
career is fabricated (See Part VIII.D.3.).

3. Schooling

a. Introduction

There is relatively little reliable collateral information |
concerning NOSEWKO's schooling up until 1950, Other than what |

he himself has reported, available information consists of overt i
‘press releases pertaining to the Minister NCSENKO's career (and. -

giving his location at various times) and comments by one KGB
officer and one defector. NOSENKO's own account, together with
references to these other sources, is summarized below. H

With the exception of minor variations in dates, attribut- |
able to memory, NOSENKO's. story of his early years until the i
beginning of World War ITI, «shen, he had just completed the sixth
grade in Moscow, has been generally consistent in its various
tellings. Moreover, his accounts of having studied in Lenin-
grad and Moscow agree with information concerning the positions
and movements of the elder NOSENKO during these years. In con- '!
trast, the pericd immediately following, during which NOSEXKO i
allegedly received his early training in naval matters {s char-
acterized with frequent changes of story, contradictions, and
admitted falsehood.

be Discussion

In 1964 and 1965 NOSENKO recalled that he enrolled in the _
Moscow special naval school in the summer of 1941, immediately
after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, and was evacucted
with the entire school from Moscow to Kuybyshev in September
to begin studies in the seventh grade. (An article in the Sov-
jet Army newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) on 14 January 1967
confirmed that seven special naval schools were established in
the Soviet Union in April 1940. Ore of these was in Moscow, :
However, to be eligible for admission, one had to have completed!
the seventh grade. The article did not indicate that the Moscow!
school was evacuated.) In April 1966, NOSENZO remembered that {
he did not go to Kuybyshev at this time but rather had been
evacuated to Chelyabinsk with his mother and entered the seventh
grade of a regular school. :

1964 ard 1965 that he returned from Kuybyshev in the summer of
1942 ard secured admission to the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School, along with which he was evacuated by train to Baku in
the fall of that year. In April 1966, after inserting the year
spent at Chelyabinsk with his mother, NOSENKO moved all events
up a year and wrote in his autobiography that he entered the
Kuybyshev school in the fall of 1942 rather than the fall of
1941. NCSENKO also wrote at this time that he transferred to
the Leningrad preparatory school and travelled to Baku in the
fall of 1943, not 1942.*

claims not to have known ARTAMOMOV nor to recognize the name.)

In all eccounts, including his 1962 statements, NOSEWKO
has said that he entered the Institute of International Rela-
tions in Moscow in 1945. His descriptions of courses, events
and friends are as vague and unsubstantial as his accounts of
his earlier schooling. He has given various cates for his -
Graduation and has explained that he did so to cover Up the
fact that he failed his final examination in the subject of
"Marxism-Leninism," of which he was asnamed. NOSENKO inost re-
cently ciaimed that he 5 eived hig diploma in the end of the

ce. Remarks

NOSENKO's own admissions, 2£ well as the small amount of
collateral informatior available, make it clear that much of his
account vf his education has teen false. ‘The reasons for tnis
are not at all clear and perhaps, in fact, there is no logical
explanation. The CIA psychologist wno tested and questioned
NCOSENKO about his youth sucgested that, under conditions of
interrogation, he may lie for no other reeson other than his
need to save face. This view is an accurate description of
HOSENKO's behavior wnen questioned in Getarl on this and other
aspects of his pre-XGB life; it is not 50 with regard to ques-
tioning on his intelligence career. Nor does the psychologist's
view appear to explain why NOSENKO forgot or tas unwilling to
tell Cia about an entire year of his life, particularly such a
significant one, after consistently and apparently accurately
(judging from the Soviet press accounts cf the Minister's
activities) describing the years preceding it. It is rot
apparent why NOSENKO originally voluntecred the story of his
travel to Baku in the fall of 1942, when this was untrte, or
why he said that the Moscow Special Naval School was evacuated
to Achinsk in 1943, when he must be aware that the school was
closed, if he was there.*

ee .
* The possibility that ROSENKO is not the person he claims
to be (and with a completely false life history, or one
lived ky someone else) has been examined carefully, but
no clear conclusion can be drawn on the pasis of available

evidence. :

¥. Appraisals of NOSENKO, his Motivation, and Other Opera- ;
Efonal Circumstances :

1. Introduction

Appraisals of NOSENKO the man and of his motivations ~~ 4
must be founded, 48 with any source, on factors which are
often immeassureable, but fewer reservations need be attached
to an appraisal of the other circumstances affecting the. q
course of events in Geneva in 1962 and 1964, These opera =. .
tional circumstances can be analyzed .and evaluated in much am
the same manner as were NOSENKO's production, sourcing, and . ad
biography for they are tangible pieces of evidence. In the
next portions of this paper are presented these appraisals,
. which draw chiefly upon Pages 603-641 (for NOSENKO the man),
Pages 20-29 (for his motivations), and Pages 11-19 and 30~
43 (for the operational circuzstances).

2. NOSENKO
—

The CIA specialists who assessed NOSENKO found hima to
be of above-average intelligence, cne of them saying that
“his effective intelligence is more cleverness than intel-
lectuality, more shrewdness than efficiency." He_is capable
of good memory and, as illustrated bs bis repeating certain
facts_in Tlie Sane He quence, Capable of what appears to he
good memorization oO} details. On the other hand, there were
nuserous internal contradictious io NOSENKO's recountings
of various events, he himself claimed an odd or poor memory,
and he was the oxceptional defector by having been totally
debriefed within a relatively short period.

Parts VII.D. and VILILE. discuss NOSEXKO's truthfulness
with reference to his Soviet Intelligence ard personal
backgrounds. Here nay be added other observations by the
CIA specialists: KOSENKO can exercise deception cleverly,

a he improvised and was evasive under interrogation, and he
hes a “remarkable” disregard for he truth where it serves
his purposes. The results of the polygraph examination were
that NOSENKO “attempted deliberate deception."

The gaps and errors in,NOSENKO's testimony therefore
do not seen attributable tao low intelligence or to consis-
tently poor memory, but to a conscious attempt to mislead
i : American Intelligence. Independently, then, this conclusion
. . raises the questions of whether NOSENKO was dispatched by
_ tbe KGB and $f so, why he was chosen. Regarding the latter
point, it is noted that a CIA psychiatrist observed: "This
° man is capable of playing & role and playing it effectively,"
jand that a CIA psychologist stated: "From a distance NO-
'SENKO looks very good [to his KGB superiors} as a possible
penetration agent, but close up he leaves much to be desired."
It was “close up," in the CIA debriefings and interrogations,
that NOSENKO displayed ao inability to explain the gaps and
errors in his reporting. .

3. Motivation

Part of one's notivation for such a drastic act as
treason or defection may not be wholly comscious, and there
may be underlying causes which any source might not went
or be able to admit even to hinself. Thus, what NOSENKO
said about motivation need not be taken at face value, and
for this reason the whole question of his motivation must
remain a minor weight in the overall asscsszent of bona fides.

NOSENKO has tried to present a meaningful explecation
and has changed or adjusted his story to this end. He
initially insisted that he had no ideological motives but
simply wanted to "make a deal" in order to get out of
trouble; yet thisclaim is open to question: The enount of
operational money which NOSENKO needed to replace was hardly
enough to have driven him to treason, especially since
there were friends in Geneva like GUK and KISLOV wko might
have helped him make up his loss. Furtheraore, only two
days after CIA had rescued him with the funds, NOSESKO
“Spent the CTA_moncy in another drunken debauchery (with the
Same companion) and came back needing more. The discre-
pancy between the degree of the need and the scriousness of
of the act was so evident that the CIA case officer commented i
to NOSENKO at the outset that there must be some deeper
explanation for his act. Thereupon NOSENKO added sew
reasons: His distaste for certain aspects of the regize,
his resentment of KHRUSHCHEV, and hig liking for Americans.

By his defection ic 1964 NOSENKO chenged the course of
his Life, although he had said in 1962, forcefully aad
unequivocally, that he would never do so unless in acute
danger. In 1964 he could give no conerent explanaticn for
the change of heart and in October 1966 he denied, for the
first time, that: hehad said in 1962 that he would not de-
fect. His only motivation was that, having risen to the
level of Deputy Department Chief, he would not get to travel
abroad any more. (This contradicts NCSENKO's 1962 state-
ments: anticipating imminent prosotion to Deputy Department
Chief, he said that he would Leave the USSR at least once
a year in the future.) For no visible reason NOSENKO seems
to have abandoned a purportedly successful and promising
career, an undisturbed 1amily life and children of shom
he was fond, cast shame on his father's menory sud his re-
maining relatives, and departed forever from his on country.

His own unease concerning his motivation evidently con-
tinued until, in 1965, he wrote one cohesive explasation.
No part of this statement was ever borne out by his conduct,
attitudes, remarks or reactions. He appeared, wherever his
reactions seemed spontanedus, to dislike the United States,
to have no interest in it politically, culturally, or
scenically, and to preserve 4 preference for the usse. A
CIA graphologist commented oa NOSENKO's “strong emotional
ties to his traditionel background,” while e CIA psycholo—
gist reported: "Emotionally he has not defected in spite
of his attempt to intellectually rationalize that he bas."
The psychologist also said that it is “almost impossible to
determine his true loyaltics and true beliefs.”

4. Operational Circumstances
a. Presence in Geneva (1962)

L962

When he case to Geneva in mid-March 1962,;-NOSENKO
was a newly appointed Section Chief in the KGB Second Chief
Directorate, havirg held this position for two months.
He binself acknowledged to CIA that it appeared strerze
for the KGS to send a new Section Chief on an extended trip
abroad unconnected with his on work. His reasong for being
in Geneve have varied and to some degree contradict one
gnother: The Disarnancnt Conference was not expected to
last more then "a few peeks," but NOSEN KO did not tegin his
work egainst SHAK:IOV (one of the main reasons for bis being
there) until six weeks after arrival; GRISANOV played &
role in his TDY, but NOSEiKO later dented this; tkere were
in 1962 “new rcles” requiring & staff officer to accompany
a Soviet delegation, but in 1965 SOSEMO said he did not
renenber such regulations. He was permitted to go to Geneva
in 1962 and 1964, as well es to Cuba ip 1950 and Frgland
in 1957 and 1958, under no supervision or restraint cespite
his claim to a record so bad thac he was not cleared by the

KGB for persancnt posting toa Ethiopia in 1960.

b. Presence in Geneva (1964)

NOSENKO said on one occasion that GRIBANOY was cne of
those who allowed him tu come to Geneva in January 1664,
as a personal favor;* he later not only denied this but said
in 1965 that GRIBANOV knew ncthing about the THY. He re-
ported the 19G4 TDY might, tecause of his neq position,
be his last trip to the West, hence the “favor" of his
superiors to perait hin this last trip; in 1962 NOSENKO
said he had the assurance that as Deputy bepartment Chief
(which he knew he was about to kecore) he would in the future
cone to the fest at least once a year. Also, XOSENKO could
-not explain why a First Deputy Departacnt Chief, if allowed
out of the USSR as e@ “treat,” would go abroad for a conference
which could be expected to last many weexs, probably months.
This question is compounded by the fact that NOSENEO would
be needed in Moscow: He said that a KGS conference to plan
the handling of the tourist season was to be held at about
this time, end he stuck to this story even aiter admitting
that the telegraa recalling him for this Moscow conference
wag an invention (sec below).

ec. Access to KGB Residency and Availability to CIA

NOSENKO in 1962 routinely visited the KGB Legal Resi-
dency in Geneva every weekday morning, although he claimed
that he had ne reason and that it is normally forbidden (as
other sources hive confirmed).*¢ When asked how end why he

capacity in 1957 and 1958, nor during his trip te Cuba in

did so ip Geneva, NOSENKO has given different ansvers at
different times. His stories of sinply “dropping in and
hanging srourd" for lack of anything better to co are
unacceptable in terms of known or likely Soviet practice.
His explanation that it was due to TSYMBAL's auspices or

or intervention vere contradicted by: First, his ovr con-
fused accounts of his relationsnip with TSYMBAL; and second,
his own statements at other times that it was GUK who was

primarily responsible for NOSEXKO's visits to the Residency. oer

,

NOSENKO had a full day free for meetings on 11 June

a
1962, although thereafter he limited meeting tines to shorte. Ht

and shorter periods until his departure. This seemed

natural at the time since he would presumably huve his own
responsibilities and would need to be seen by his Soviet
colleagues ion his proper surroundings. However, in 1964.

he seesned not to save any official responsibilities or any
calls on bis time: He was willing to spend all his time in
mectings with CIA. Although this could be explained by the
fact that he planned to defect anyway, it nevertheless would
have involved unnecessary risks to a genuine source about

to become a defector. Ho showed no concern at the time,

but later (in 1966), he said that he had been ib fact afraid;
it was for this reason that he invented the Moscow recall
telegram, in order to hasten ais defection and put en end

to his fears of getting caught. It is, of course, impossible
to make conclusive judgments on Soviet practice, tut one
would expect, if NOSENKO were not engaged in security duties,
that he would be required to participate for cover reasons

in more of the Sovict delegation's official activity. He
seid that any absence could be explained as “security duties,"
since everyone on the Soviet Delegation knew or suspected
that he was a KGB officer. This unconcern for the suspictons
of other Soviets conforms neither with obsérved Soviet
practice nor with reports from other sources that Soviet
intelligence and security officers under cover go to some
pains to hide their true affiliation.

NOSENKO explained the contrast between his freedom
and availability in 1964 and his limited free tine in 1962
by the fact that in 1964 he had po personal friends in
Geneva; in 1962 both GUK and KISLOV expected to see him io
his free time. (This story does not explain his ability io -
1964 to get away during conference working hours; neither

" GUK nor KISLOV affected this in 1962.)

@. Timing of .1962 Contact

NOSENKO had been in Geseva for three months in 1962
when the incident which brought him to CIA occurred; it
was only two weeks before his departure. He came to David
MARK only 10 days before leaving. This had tke effect of
limiting CIA's time with him. NOSENKO's contact came only
about 10 days after CIA had completed, in the same city, a
series of meetings with BELITSKIY, a Soviet interpreter who
bad been recruited and handled as an agent by CIA during
earlier visits to the West. NOSENKO, as one of the two
primary items he wanted to “sell” revealed that BELITSKIY
had been under KGB control from tie outset (Page 517).

e. Willingness to Meet CIA

Although in 1962 NOSENKO Claimed that he wanted to
sell only two specific items for the money he had lost, and
then disappear, there were indications from the outset that
he expected and planned to come back for further meetings
with CIA. At this first meeting he called attention to
certain information in his possession about POPOV, hinting

that he would teil it later; even as he protested his unwilling-

ness to continue meeting with CIA, he was giving ample
detaiis about himself which would inevitably have compro-
mised him to CIA and forced his future ccllakoration. Before
he finally agreed to ‘return for more meetings, he said:
"Maybe I‘}) meet you again Monday’ (two days after the first
meeting). NOSENKO refused, despite repeated inducenents,

to meet on the intervening Sunday. in fact, when he did
return on Monday, ne said that he had spent Sunday with
friends, drinking and “discussing recent USSR foreign policy
moves and speeches by KU RUSECHEV. © :

The operational circumstances so far reviewed point
out the facts that: .

stating his reasons for being in Geneva in 1962 and
1964;

- He had unusual access to the KGE Legal Residency
and an availability for meeting CIA that seemed to
impinge upon his security;

- He was willing to return to meetings with CIA al-
though having at first said that there were but two
items of information for sale;

~ He was “in place* as a CIA source for the last
six of his 100 or so cays in Geneva in 1962, thus
restricting the amount of time he could provide continu-
ing reporting on the local Legal Residency; and ‘

754. . Hi

Taken together, these facts suggest the possibilities
that the KGB sent NOSENKO to Geneva on both occasions for
the purpose of contacting CIA, that the KCB wanted the
opportunity to gauge CIA‘s reactions to the walk-in in 1962
and to the defection plans in 1964, and that the KGB gui¢e. d
NOSENKO after contact was established in both years.

A further examination of the operational circumstances
in Geneva lends credence to these possibilities. During the
1962 meetings. NOSENKO would frequently. answer CIA questions

by saying: "I will have to think about that tonight," or

"] wiil have some time tonight to jot down and prepare a |

good answer for you," or "I don‘t vant to give you an answer

to that right off--I am afreid to mislead you." He would | .
return to a later meeting with the information, after having ,

visited the Legal Residency. In 1964 there were other
examples of what may have been backstage guidance by the
KGB: :

-He called for an urgent special meeting to cor-
rect something he had said in an earlier meeting.
Initially KOSENKO had named ZUJUS instead of KEYSERS
as the U.S. Embassy code clerk whom he had personally
approached. in 1961. This seened remarkably urgent and : !
important to him at the time, and in retrospect this 5
case gains special importance: It was the only time
he claimed to have had direct contact with a9 U.S.
Embessy staff employee during his alleged tour in the
American Department ip 1960-1961. If he could not
remember this one name, it might call his entire story :
into question, It is hard to find another explanation; |
had he simply made 8 careless mistake, with his cus-
tomary indifference to names and dates. NOSENKO would
be unlikely to mull over what he hed said at the meeting
nor to bother about correcting a minor misstatement.

Much less would he feel compelled to call an emergency
meeting to do 50.

!
~He came to meetings with "chance" items picked |
up at the Legal Residency, esch of which would require
quick action and the commitment of assets on the part
of CIA in Geneva. Also, NOSENKO originally said io
January 1964 that he wanted to defect right away, but
various steps taken or planned by his CIA handlers
tte kept him in place for a time. Each step, however. was
quickly negated~-usually at the next meeting--by some
information NOSENKO bad picked up by chance.

or meen

‘ . -He asked, out of context and without apy explana-
‘ tion, whether GOLITSYN had told CIA that the President i
: of Finland was a Soviet agent, and later could not
: coherently explain where he had heard this, why he hed
not told CIA about it in 1962, and why he had asked.
+
|

In addition, the Soviet reactions to the defection were
unprecedented and contrasted sharply with, for example, the
H Soviets" avoidance of publicity concerning GOLITSYN's defec=
to. tion in 1961. The post-defection actions ty the Soviet - |
Government created publicity which had the superficial effect |

i . of underlining NOSENKO's authenticity, establishing him as
i 7 a public figure, confirming that he had a family, and veri-
| fying that his defection was of alarming consequence. These

reactions seem purposeful in light of the approach in Paris
in 1966 of a Soviet photographer to Paris Match; the photo-
grapher passed photographs of NOSENKO'S wife and chilcren
as part of a proposed story to dramatize the abandoned
fanily of a “top Soviet intelligence officer" whose cefec-
tion had caused the "biggest blow ever suffered by Soviet
Intelligence.“ There is no independent press in the USSR,
no Soviet journalist Allowed to publish as he pleases, and
the Soviet Government in the past has shown no predisposi-
tion to dramatize defections from its most secret agency.
The photographer can only be presumed to have been acting on
KGB instructions.

SR. Most of them have described the ‘serious repercus-

the accuracy of these sources’ reporting are:

First, they are correct. If so, the foregoing
analysis is in error, they ore valid sources, and
NGSENKO ig what he claims to be: 2 genuine defector
whose previous positions in the KGb enabied hir to

Second, they are misinformed. If so, the fore-
going analysis is correct, they may Le valic sources,

this to ke true, it would have teen necessary for the
KSB to dispatch NOSENKO with only @ highly restricted
number of KGB pexsonnel (including GRIEAIOY) aware of
the actual circumstances: of the oneration. The K3B,
at the same time, would have propagated within and out-
side of the Soviet Incelligence Services the fiction
that NOSENKO was an actual but aisloyal KGB offacer
and would have supported this fabrication in verisus

Third, they have keen purposefully misleading.

H. “Alternative Explanations
1. | Introduction

-“parts VIII.B. through VIII.P. have discussed the
inaccuracies, self-admitted contradictions, inconsistencies,
and incompleteness of NOSENKO's reporting about himself ‘and
the KGB. Collectively, these important flaws in the story
of and by NOSENKO make it necessary to choose an explanation
for his actions and the nature of his information. There
are thgee alternatives:

Pirst, NOSENKO was a KGB officer but (a) has
a faulty or selective memory, has embellished or
boasted, or his reporting has been influenced by a
combination thereof; or (b) he is insane.

Second, NOSENKO lied about himself in order to
save face. :

Third, NOSEKKO has misrepresented himself, either
on his own or at the instigation of the KGB.

Each of these mutually exclusive alternatives is discussed
below.

2. First Alternative

According to one postulate, NOSENZO was an-officer in
the KGB but has a faulty memory, his a selective memory,
and/or has embellished or boasted:

a. Faulty Memory

NOSENKO himself has repeatedly appealed for understanding
that “different pecple have differcnt memories” and that
his own is, “funny,” and this is supported by his forget ful-
ness and errors concerning events he is xn inderendently
to have lived through, such as the BURGi ard a casos.
But it cannot be said that he is, in general, “very bad with
names," because he nas almost total recail of names and
positions of hundreds of KGB officers in the Saerican and
Tourist Departments. He has a good memory for ‘teces and
rarely failed to recognize photcgraphs of people he claimed
to know. He rememhered consistently details about certain
operations (the compromise and investigation of PENKOVSKIY,
the surveillance of ABIDIAN to Pushkin Street, the JENNER
case, the arrest of ‘BARGHOORN, and the search for CHEREPANOV,
to cite a few examples). NCSENKO was precisely accurate in
his recollection of most of his dealings with CIA personnel
from June 1962 onward.

b. Selective Memory

Although having a selective memory is probably true of
nearly everyone, a CIA psychologist has described NOSENKO as
a psychopath who would register each passing event only in
relation to its effect on himself at that moment. This
would inevitably make him indifferent to the characteristics
of other people, for example, and to the sequence in which
events transpired; the aspects important to him might rot
appear so to a more objective observer. Such a person would

9 SECRET,

we

ae bee
14-00000

760,

suppress unpleasant memories and would have no real appre-

ciation of or respect for an “objective truth." His re-

porting, like his perception and his memory, might therefore in
seem distorted. He right recount events according to his -.
mood of the moment. Thus, fo~ example, if real attachments - te ot
to family or friends is impossible for a psychopath, there Hs

be an explanation as to why NOSENKO cannot easily remember a

his childrens’ birthdays, why io 1962 (or 1965) he appears

to have lied--or been indifferent to the truth--about his

older daughter's schooling, and why he cannot recall when

he first married. in theory this hypothesis can explain

any aberration, since it involves the unknowable. In its

most extreme form, by describing NOSENKO as one unable to

discriminate between fact and fancy, it would encompass and

explain away the facts that his story is obviously untrue

and contradictory in major ways, that his account of his

personal and professional lite and his rendition of the.

information he knows are so vague and unsubstantial; that

he cannot (and/or does not care to) rememver or recount

how he did the things he did. Most important, it woula

dismiss any conciusions based on NOSENKO's testimony siace

nothing NOSENKO said could be taken seriously. This hypo-

thesis, however, is unsupportable because of several

factors.

First, XNOSENKO claims--and other sources confirm--that
he quickly rose to high supervisory responsibility in a
counterintelligence organization which is known to require
attention to detail. He would have risen in the KGB while’
overcoming the black marks in his file: scandal, indiscip-
line, negative background factors, and bad Party record.
NOSENKO admits that his performance was not good; he was
inattentive and inactive and almost none of his operational
activity was carried out unaccompanied. That his rise re-
sulted from his father's influence or GRIBANOV's is unten]
able, for his father died in 1956 and GRIBANOV's patronage
(itself open to the strongest doubt) would not and could not
be dispensed upon such a mental case. Mental aberration to
the degree which would explain his poor performance under
CIA interrogation would necessarily have hindered his per-
formance of KGB duties, denied him special privileges, and
and hence cost him the career which NOSENKO has claimed for
himself.

A second factor negating this hypothesis of a psychoe
pathic personality is that such a person could be induced
to recall certain details with the help of discussion,
questioning, and reminders, whereas NOSENKO'sS vague and hazy
reports seem to represent the ebsolute limits of his memory
or knowledge. Years of questioning have not succeeded in
dredging up any new details or incidents. Even when reminded,
he could not recall, for example, one of KOSOLAPOV's TDYs to
Helsinki, the details of the seizure of electronic equipment
from the U.S. Arny Attaches at Stalingrad, the correct date
of GOLITSYN's defection, or the presence of KHRUSHCHEY in
Moscow at the time of the decision to arrest BARGHOORN,

Another factor is the impossibility of applying this
hypothesis to the totality of NOSENKO's reporting. If the
hypothesis holds that some. things are important to him and
others are not, and that he therefore remembers the former
and forgets the latter, it is refuted by the inability to.

find a category of information aboyt himself which he con-
§ Istently remembered nor any that he consistent y forgot.

~ what is important is his cen direct experiences, for "
example, it 1s odd that he recéfled the operations of others
better than his own; he remembered the names of hundreds of
KGB officers, but could not recall] names of his own agents
and people invoived in his own career; he could recount”
details of the PEXKOVSKIY investigation, in which he did
not participate, but not of the discovery of American spies
among tourists, such as McGOWAN, for which he was responsible;
he remembered details of the 1955 MALIA case in which he
did not meet the target personally but forgot details of the
1961 KEYSERS case in which he did. If it is the importance
to him of recruitment operations against U.S. Embassy em-
ployees which permitted him to recall sone details of the
STORSBERG and MULE operations, it is not important enough

to help him recall some of the other details which were
equally pertinent to nim personally; and it is not selective
memory which made him forget almost every detail about CIA
personnel in Moscow and KCB action against them. If it is
said that his parental faniiy is important to him ( hence
his memory of his father's funeral and the names of his
uncles and aunts), it is odd that he cannot recall details
about his childhood. If drinking with important people is
meaningful to him, it would explain why he remembers one
GRIBANOV evening with sharp clarity, but it does not eyplain
why he cannot remember the other two times, not even in what
season of the year or in what restauradt they took plece.

Finally, with reference to the "selective memory" hypo—
thesis, it is precisely in matters NOSENKO said he remembers
best and which he told most confidently that the majority of.
inexplicable contradictions arise. Nothing could shake him
from his claim to have been directly responsible for ABiDIAN
or on his story of the Pushkin Street dead drop, among
numerous exanples.

ce. Embellishment

The third possibility is that he has simply embellished
and boasted, while underlying his story is a core of truth
somewhere near what he has reported. NOSENKXO has, after all,
admitted many “white lies" and boasts ("painting” himself, as
he called it). Also, in the interrogations there were
repeated signs that he was fabricating and improvising, often
in ways which led him into more contradictions and further
admissions of white lies. Perhaps.then, according to this
hypothesis, he simply invented, on his own, various aspects
of his career. Perhaps he dated his entry into the KGB
earlier to make himself seem more experienced, and invented

‘his service in the American Department to make himself more

interesting to American Intelligence. Perhaps he was only
a principal agent, not a staff officer, but learned enough
from his operations and from his handlers to think he could

‘pose as one. This hypothesis would certainly explain many

of the dubious aspects: ‘the story of his career, his lack
of information on KGB staff procedures, his ignorance of
major KGB events and sources, the degree of his relationship
with GRIBANOV, etc. This theory, however, founders on &
number of points: :

individual theories, it cannot explain the countersrgusents
discussed under corponent parts above.

e. Insaaoity
aa

It might ve pustulatec that NOSEXYO went insana and that
this ves the cause not only of his seestagly unmotivated
contact with CIA $n 1962 but of shortcomings in his story.
However, NOSZNXO thereafter pandled senior XGB functions
well enough to te pronoted anu to be persitted abroad in
1964; he tas Seca exesined pericdically by a CIA psyci:olo-
gist anda CLA psychiatrist; he has been in contact over
considerable periats of time and under veryirg degrees of
stress with experienced CIA and FBL perscanel; he has naine
tained his equilibrium under difficult circurstances. Nore
of the foregoing results in an indication of fnsanity and
there are countless other argunents which would invalidate

thas hypothes3s.

3. Second Alternative

It has also been fostulated that NOSENKO is a psycho~ oe

path, is what he says ine is, but that ror psychological
reasons ond while under interrojation, he did not want to
tel] what he knew. By this line of reasoning, NOSENKO has
lied for no other reason than to save face; by dwelling on
the inconsisteacies in NOSENKO's statements, the interro-
gator merely caused nore inconsistercies or elso recetved
the false answers toat NOSEXKO did not know or did not re-
menber the facts. Uncer interrogation, hewever, NOSENKO
recalled acd repeated what he had previousiy said in the
less inhibiting atmosphere ef the relaxed debriefings prior
to 4 April 1904. This alternative explanation

thus does aot account for the factual contradictions in
NOSENKO'S reporting before the interrogations, such as the
errors in dates, in soureing on the “ANDREY" case, in de-
tails about the Pushkin Strect dead drop, etc. It also
fails to eccount for KOSESK?'s retractions about his rank as

4. Third Altersative

The only other postulate is that NOSENKO is not what
he claims to be, in which casc his sisrepresentation was
done either on his own or as part of a KGB operation.

if he is misrepresenting himself on his own, there are
(even in theory) only two pussibilities: He is merely exag- \
gerating (discussed above, under the “First Alternative") or
he 4s a fabricator. He cannot be & fabricator, however, since
the Soviets have certified him in many ways; including his-
diplonatic status at the Geneva Conference, Soviet official
protests and Sovact Embassy confrontation in Washington,
Soviet officials’ renarks in yarious ereas of the world, and
reports fron @ignewar, other sources OF his KGB status end

764,

There remains the possibility that NOSENKO has misrep-
resented himself and is a witting part of a KGB operation. This
hypothesis could accormodate the argument that the RGB would
not cispatch a KGS staff officer aa a double agent against a
hostile service because, whether or not the arguzent is valid,
NOSENKO (as indicated in Part VIII.D. above) has not proven his
claim to having served as an officer of the KGS. If he has
been and is now under KGB control, it would appear that he was
being built up for years to look like an officer and was shown
to Westerners in certain recruitment operations.* This could
explain NOSENKO's revelations to FRIPPEL and others about his
family and background; the otherwise pointless W.E. JOHNSON
case, and NOSENKO's appezrance in the BARGHOORN interrogation.
It could explain NOSENKO's uneven memory and performance under
detailed questionirg: Much of what he should have known by
personal experience could have bcen merely memorized as part
of his KG3 briefing. Nothing .n NOSENNO'S production (see
Part VII1.B. above) would preclude his being a kGS-dispatched
agent. That he was a KG8-dispatcned agent was the conclusion
independently arrived at by the CIA specialist who administered
a polygraph examination to NCSENKO in April 1964.

4. Pemarks

The first alternative above has been rejected while the
possibility that hOSENKO on his own misrepresented nimself
is unacceptable. The remaining possibility is that NOSENKO
has been manipulated by the «G3 in an operation directed

against American Intelligence.

= fiis American Department service in 1960-1961 was not supported
by any such “show” appearances--he did not insist on the
truth of his claim to participation in the KEYSERS case,
which, moreover KEYSERS a t confirm; PREISFPEUND is an
unreliable witness; and is not accessible to
interview.

The NUSENKY case has not been aiscussed with GOLITSYI since

the 29 dune 1964 tatervieds thus he hs3 not seen questioned

further on the circunctunces which led to the encounters with

HOSENKU described by him, nor have the results of subsequent

detailed reinterrogsutions of NOSENKO - discussed at length in

the foregoing sections of this paper - been made available to

him for review, analysis, or comments

2. Resume and Discussion of Information*

American Deparctmont = 1953
NUSiNKO has said that he entered the KGB in arch 1953**

and was first assiqned to the U.S. Embassy Section of the American

Department of what $3 now the Second Chief Directorate, KGB. He

atetad that his duties from tia entry until sometime in 1954, per-

haps about June, were to work on files of american corresponients

on permanent assignment to “osco# and to meet with the Soviet

citizens who were agents or informants reporting on the corres-

pondents to the <GB.

GOLITSM! stated that he met NOSENKO in the American Depart-

ment of the Internal Counter intelligence Directorate*** a couple

of times in 1953 when he, GULITSYN, was there on other matters.

GOLITSYN had earlier identified his own job between becember

1952 and April 1953 a3 Chief of the american Sector, Counter-

intelligence (Ninth) Department, Foreign Directorate, under the

Chief Intelligence Directorate (formed in December 1952 and re-

organized in April 1953). From April 1953 until his departure

Department, Foreign Intelligence Directorate. CGOLITSYN has not

positions which would have necessit3ted his visiting the American i
Department of the Internal Counterintelligence Directorate, although
certain activities of cormon interest with the latter would appear
. logical. NOSEMKO's description of his alleged duties with corres-
pondents, however, did not encompass his having official contacts

Department of the Foreign Directorate. Accordinc to NOSENKO'?
description of the location of his claimed office in the American

Department, and his description of the duties of the co-worrers

representative would have been"precluded. Even by NOSRIKO's account,
then, an encounter between GOLITSYN and himself could not have

been in the course of interdepartmental liaison between their
respective units, nor could it have occurred in NOSEIKO's office.

GOLITSYN's lack of reporting on KCB operations against American

correspondents (other than his conversation with KOVSHUK in 1956

or 1957 about Henry SHAPIRO) is further evidence that his business
“in the American Department was unrelated to NCSENKO's claimed
activities at that time, and GOLITSYN's own statement on the 1953
encounters implied that his meetinas with NOSENKO were accidental.
Pleeting as their contacts “ould therefore have been, it could
have led GULITSYN to make the unfounded assumption that NOSENKO ©
was a member of the staff within the american Department.
fwerican Department/Tfourist Department - 1955-1960
HOSENKO stated that he transferred from the American Depart-
ment to the Tourist Department in June 1955, and remained in the ‘
Tourist Department until 1960, becoming a deputy chief of section
there in 1958.
GOLITSYH, however, insisted that NOSEXKO remained in the

- American Oepartment until at least 1957, or possibly as late as :

1958. GOLITSYN added that the KGB would not ba aware that he knew.

HOSERKU's true position in the american Department in 1357 or
1958. GOLITSM dia not indscate how he acquired his knowledge
on this nor why the KGB subsequently would have vean unable to
deterrone thst ne had. If nis access to this information wae in-
decd that remote (a3 GULITS£I's assignment in 1957 and 1956 vould
indicate ~ see below), it is readily apparent that it could like- ,,
wise be gomewhat garbled. COLITSYN was unable to explain the i
fact that NOSEXKO's physical presence in exclusively Tourist
Department cases had been ,ositively established through photo {
identifications made by several of the individuals “involved, who
met SOSEIKO as eurly as 1956. ;
From 1955 to 1959 (the same years when HOSENKO claimed to
have becn in the Teurist Bepartmant) GOLITSYN was enrolled in
the KGB Higher School. Ne was detached from the school, in the
period January-tarcn 1959, in order to gether material for his
thesis. At that time GOLITS@ spent just under two months in
the Tourist Department,* but GOLITSYN's work did not involve hiz
. dn any day-to-day operational activities of this department. He
has reported having “occasionally” met NOSENKO in 1959; slthcuch
he did not specify that it was at precisely this time, it seems
probable that it woulc have been. GOLITSYN said that he asked
NOSENKO in 1959 where he w2s working and NOSENKO told him the
Tourist Department. Again it appears from this that his ancounters
; must have been brief, superficial, and not work-related, hence
insufficient for GOLITSYN to arrive independently at a well-founded
conclusion as to NOSENKO's actual status and function with the

Touriet Department.

’ *In describing his own and others’ responsibilities in the Tcurist
Department, NOSEiKO has made no reference to this unit having a
formal or regular relationship with tne KGB school or to students

from the school having been detached to the department.

Tno detutled interrogations of KOSKY cu

to KGB positions betwean 1953 and 1964, did not take plice until

tmany months after GOLITsY¥l made his staterents, Jand they sere ba3ed |

upon all collatersl information knowreteting to each phase. None
of the rasults of these interrogations was made available to
GOLITSYN, so he was not aware of the countless points eon which
NOSEXKO contradicted known facts and revealed his ignorance of
activities which were carried out by the KGB during his alleged
tenure in theas-beportments. :
3. Comments on GCOLITSYN
Several factors influence the evaluation of GOLITSYN's states
ments on WOSENKOs
, - First, as stoted in Part VIII.I., it is concluded
that NOSENKO did not serve in the KGB positions ‘he claimed.
GOLITSNA's testimony verified this conclusion insofar as
NOSENKO's claims abcut service in the U.S. Embassy Section
of the American Department in 1960-1961 are concerned. hore-
over, in 1962 GOLITSYN concluded that the KGB “letter-writer®
(actually NOSEXKO) was under KGB control in submitting infor- ,
mation to american Intelligence. At issue, therefore, is the
evidence from GOLITSYN to the effect that NOSEXKO was en
officer in the American Department (until 1957 or 1958, “whereas
HOSAIKG said he was reassigned from the department in 1955)
and in the Tourist Department subsequently.
~ Second, GOLITSYN made no comment about or identification
of NOSENKO prior to the public announcement of the latter's ;
defection, despite many previous opportunities to do 80 (e.gee _
in discussions of GUX, CHURANOV, and KASHCHEYEV) and despite

GOLITSYN's proven excellence of memory. for names and tasks of

KGB personnel. GULITSYN gave little detail on the eircum-
stances of hia encounters with NOSHIKO, and. he has not been
questioned further sbout them. Nevertheless, as indicated in |

the foregoing remarks on the circumstances in which the two

.
men could have met, it seems apparent that any contact would .

have been brief, infrequent, casual, extra-offictal, and! sees sEfsl

b2en in contact with GLINSY.* Yossible explinetion: for
GOLITSYN's having referred to their encounters pat having mis-
identified NUSENKO's positions in the KCe ares) First, GOLITS¢N
could have erreds second, GOLITSYN cculd have lied for personsl :
reasons? and third, COLITSA! could heave lied st the direction
of the KGB because he (like NOSENKO) is under iG3 control. To
exvamine each of these points scparutely:
- GULITSYN could have erred. Apart from tag dental
by HUSEXKO, who is an unreliable source, there i3 no evidence
to refute COLITSYJ's statement that he and NCS2iKO met in
the smerican vepartment in 1953 and in the Tourist Otpartment
in 1958 or 1959. (The conclusion! &-“Sort VIII.I. about
NOSENKO's bona fides do not rule out the rossibility that
-~ he was physically present on occasion on the premises of tho
two departments in these years, although not in the cepacities
that he has claimed.) The nature of their encounters, however, i
could have been such that GOLITSY:! erred in assuming - because :
© : HOSERKO was seen on or near the premises of the two departments,
and because NOSEXKO told GOLITSY# in 1958 cr 1959 that he was
in the Tourist Department - that NOSEIKO was therefore an
officer of these specific elements of the #23 Second Chief
Directorate. Thus, if GOLITSYN met NOSENKO as he said, he

mistakenly identified NOSENKO ag being a menber of the staffs

. of the 4merican and Tourist Departments at these times.
= GOLITSYN ‘could have lied for personal reasons. He may

have believed that to say he met NOSENKO or to say he knew

* There is insufficient information available to reach a conclusion :
about, or even speculate on, why NOSENKO was so certain GOLITSYR's
defection occurred in January 1962, as contrasted with the fsct

F that it took place on 15 December 1961. :
t

Husiiku's positicns in 1 the KC would ui) cuthenticity to
his earlier evalu. tion of the HUGENKO information of 1962,
to his: contradictions of NUSLIKO'S Statements concerning
service in tho U.3. Embassy Section and the ogerations of
thet section, and to his contention that the KGB would try
to counteract his (GOLITSYN's) information by spreading
purportedly authoritative but purposefully misleading reports
on the same subject matter. In summary, COLITS“'s intention
in lying about NOS2ixO could simrly have been te add greater
credibility to his expresseé opinion that 'hsc:h0 was a RED
provocateur.

~ CULITSYN could have lied ut the direction of the KGB,
an explanation that is examined here for the sake of completeness
and not Lecause Cla has any reason to relieve GOLITSYN is under
KG3 control. This explanation would mean that COLITSYN,
although offering purtial confirmation for NOSm:KO's claims,
directly attucked the bona Fices of another KGB-dispatched
agent of allegedly comparable rank and knowledgeability. aeting
under KG3 instructions, GOLITSYN would have sought to undermine

HOSENKO's acceptability, regardless of the fact that NOSCNKO

said he wes providing reliable and comprehensive information
about KGB operations against «merican officials and tourists”
in the USsR. At the sume time, NOSENKG wis not giving an
account of their relationship that waa consistent with COLITSYN‘s,
by implication NOSENKO wag distorting or diluting the earlier
reports of GOLITSYN on KGB operations in the Soviet Union,
oo: and NOSEXKO was seeking to gain acceptance by CIA equal to that
experienced by GOLITSYN. According to this hypothesis, two
sources under KGB control - each striving for acceptance -
deliberately guve conflicting stories of their -slationship,
and each tried to undermine the bona {ides of the other,
; GOLITSYI explictly and HOSE:KO by implication. This explanation
i : is so illoz‘cal, as well a3 so detrimental to tho KGB, that

it must be rejected From serious consideration.

There are two explanations for NOSBIKO's denial about having

contact, the KGB was aware of this fact, and - unprepared for

GOLITSYN's statements to the contrary ~ the KGB briefed NOSZIKO

secordingly. If in this particular instance NOSETKO told the

truth and (as discussed above) GOLITSYN did not, no additional

or different conclusion can be draxn apout the bona fides of

NOSENKO and his claims of service in the KGB. The second explenation
is that, as GOLITSYN said, these encounters did take plece in 1953
and again in 1958 or 1959, but becuusa of their casual and fleeting

nature, NOSENKO (unlike COLITSYN) has not remembered then.

It is common knowledge among KGB employees that
GRIBANOV was expelled from the KGB and CPSU and
is now on pension, partial rather than full, as
a result of the NOSENKO defection. When NOSENKO
was being considered for assignment to Geneva
(in 1961), a summary statement of his activities
was prepared in the Second Chicf Directorate and
sent to GRPBANOV. This summary contained con-
siderable “compromising information" concerning
NOSENKO; 2f acted upon properly, it would have
removed him from connideration for this trip.
GRIB/ANOV read the summary material, ran a line
through all of it, and udded the notation: "Send

a to Genuva." The general feeling is that

b. The Conpromise of PEXYOVSK1Y

(i) Introdnetion

SEEARP and NUSENKO agree on only one aspect of the
PENKOVSKIY compromise (see Part VI11.B.6.b. They both
attribute the init’ mpronise t2 XGR survcillance. Al-
though m@& (GN: revort sgrees with NOSENKG that
the KGR learn American partictpation in the operation
only after PENKOVSKIY was arrested, Qi subsequent reports
contradict this by tying the comprotise directly to survoil-
lance of U.S. Embassy personael visiting the Pushkin Street
dead drop sitc. s@H3eMFE story of the events stenming from
the corpromise of the cvad drop site is at odds both with
the facts of the case and with all other reporting by
Soviet sources of CIA and the FBI.

(ii) Discussion

), SER e port OSA RAG) 9G2--the aonth
after the KGB terminated tne operation--indicated that the
KGB had been aware of FEXXOVSXIY's involvement with Aneri-
cans, and specifically with the CIA officer JACOB, for about

two and one half months prior to the arrests. This state-

ment is inaccurate concerning JACOB, “io was a last-minute
substitute for the servicing of thy: Pushkin Street dead drop

on 2 November 1962 and who never before had personally par-
ticipated in the operation. @¢S@Z#28@ statenents otherwise FA :
agree with NCSENKO's subsequent report and the “official

report" regarding KG3 ignorance of the rele of American
Intelligence in the PENKOVSKIY cose.

~ sport on the case, however, is contra
dictory tu his first repert and to the othe: sources: He
“said in 1963 that surveillance of U.S. Embassy tar-
gets detected a visit to the Pushkin Sircct site by an
American, and that the resulting 24-hour surveillance of the
site caught PENKOVSKIY visiting the sane location, whereupon
he was arrested and confessed. CIA, however, has no evi-
dence besides the statements bE that PENKOVSKIY ever
went to the Pushkin Strect site after it was visited by CIA
personnel.

i In Qe 1963 GEAR reported at greater length about
: the role of Pusnkin Street in PENKOVSKIY's compromise. At
this time he explained that the American had visited Pushkin
Street not once but twice: surveillance had observed him on
both occasions when he went inside the entrance, but followed
“him inside only on the second visit. The surveillint who ne
entered the buildinz reported that the dAsecrican appeared to :
be tving his shoe; although this was not unusual in itself,
ontinucd, the fact that it was the second visit to
the same address for no visible purpose caused suspicion,
and as a result the KGB installed a closed circuit TV camera
to provide 24-hour coverage of the site. PENKOVSKIY was ob-
served checking it (see preceding paragraph): an American
was observed loading a dead drop behind a lobby heating unit
(radiator); the KGB tagged the dead drop material with a
radioactive substance; PENKOVSKIY was observed unloading the
dead drop and proceeding to his office where he secreted the

NOSENKO have indicated thet this compromise resulted from

Presented below are QYERESs remarks about NOSENKO, followed by
a review of the topics common to these two sources.

2. Statements on NOSENKO

When discussing NOSENKO for the first time, EMRE said on

x Oe ae thet they were not crersonelly acquainted, but ~
that arious persons" in Moscow (whom he did rdét identify) had
spoken to him about NOSENKO. The statements by WEERee and NOSENKO
on the latter's background are compared in the following tabulation:

As a young man, NOSENKO attended NOSENKO said his entire ser-

the GRU's Military-Diplomatic vice in the GRU, in the years

recently, the course has been of three years' duration.

fluentiai person in the Mizistry

NOSFNKO's statements abcut him-
self during the 1950-1953 period
appear to acree with the evalu-
ation, but he has said nothing
about facing discharge by the

His transfer from the Naval Gau
to the £G3 Jn 1953, NOSOIKO

Said, ws at the initiative of
get NOSSNKO transferred to the KGR General KOBULKY, @ friend

KGB. of nis father: the eléer NOSENKO
was Minister of Shnipbuiiding.

NOSEXKO was “an important boss" Recording te NCSETKO, his most
recent KG3 title vrior to de-
fecting was Deputy Cnief,
Tourist Department, KG3 Second
chief Direcrorate.

ae stated that NOCENKO gave ‘vor, Very geod information"
to the ented States, having had “greac access" to KGB information
which included "all means of KGP coveraze of people in Moscow,
geGophere systems in the embassies, etc. ine J.5. Embassy
ontinued, hed found micrephones on the basis of informatio
that NCSENKO had provided.

3. Parallels with NOSENKO's Reporting
a. The CHEREPANOV Case
(i) Summary

One of the two ways in which SER ras corroborated NOSENKO
on the authenticity of CHEREPANOV asa cenuine source of American.

‘the KS CHEREPANOV cave some” papers to the U.S, Embassy in Moscow,
which returned them to che Soviet Miniscry of Foreign Affairs
(MFA).; the MFA turned the papers over to the “GB, which traced
them by analysis to CHEREPANOV; meanwhile, CHEfREFANOV had tried

to flee the USSR, but he was captured near the Turkish border and
executed. In every major. respect, therefore agrees with
NOSENKO's version of tne case. When asked whether the CHEREPANOV
incident might Fave been “a trick" by the KGS to embarrass the

U.S. Embassy, IS replied that it was definitely not.
The second way in which Pee] has certified that CHEREPANOV
.. was a geatine source is indirect. Like NOSEKO ang-enp-0f the
CHEREPANOV documents, Qggemse hea indicatee that KGB surv7illance
of a U.S. Embassy officer creugnt about the compromise of POFOV.

(ii) Remarks

As stated in Part VIII.B.6., the CHEREPANOV incident was a”
KGB provocation against the U.S. Embassy, but it is conceivable
that statements suggesting the contrary could heve been made

going to the vicinity of a new bridge near the Moscow Stadium,

and there taking photographs of the bridge and surrounding area.

POPOV unloading a dead drop. He was arrested, doubled, and
“operated” against American Intelligence for ao year ard one-half.*
Eventually, the KG3 put in motion a plan to attempt to compromise
the Anerican official who was meeting POPOV. The KGS photographed
a meeting in a Moscow restaurant, then arrested the official and

Since POPOV returned to Moscow in November 1958 and LANGELLE
was arrested the following October, he could not have been
doubled against CIA for more than eleven months.

** Starting on 4 January 1959, POPOV had a series of six brush
contacts in Moscow with the CIA officer Russell LANGELLE of
the U.S. Embassy, culminating in the detention and interview
of LANGELLE by the KGB on 16 October 1959.

Her professed personal involvezent in, and dramatic accounts of,

ance. ie ieee s reporting on NCSENKO, despite vequeness

markedly from NOSENKO's in basis, scope, and detail, confirmed
almost to the month NOSENKO's dating of the compromise. Her
confessed p2rticipetion as an egent of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate, despite her repeated claims to know noting of im-
portance concerning its operations, has placed her in NOSEXKO's
milieu, and the KGS officers who figured in her reporting are

identificd as KG3 officers only by NOSEXKO,

knoswleéGe of NCSENKO, reporting at various times that she had
heard gossip, had heard about him from her KGB friend SVIRIN
(who she belicved only "knew about" NOSE:KO, i.e. did not know
him personally), or had heard about him from “someone froa the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not SVIRIN.” She has reported frag-
ments on NOSENKO's background: his father's positicn, his mother's
ethnic background, and NOSENKO's ron-KG2 status. She initially
said that NOSENKO's father was a general, later said she was not
x sure of that, and stiil later amended her description to “ceneral
: or minister," edding that he was Ukrainian - thes approaching
an accurate statement only efter several conversations about
him. Her consistent statement that NOSENKO's mother was Jewish
and involved in black market activities has not keen elsewhere
reported, and her statement that NOSENXO was a civilian, rather
thar a KGB officer, contradicts his own account and that of
other sources who have confirmed his KGS status.
sourcing of her Limited information on NOSENKO to her KGB frien
SVIRIN nevertheless demonstrates at least potential access to
some information about NOSENKO. (SVIRIN was identified by
NOSEWKO as an officer of the Third Section of the American
——_—_——_ — Department, Second Chief Directorate, since 1963, and oefcre
that of the Third Department of the Directorate of the KG3
Second Chief Directorate, where he participated in and received
an award for his part in the investigation of PENKOVSKIY.}

5. Remarks

There is confusior in yes aT. sub-sourcing for her
information on NOSENKO and incomsistency in her statements that.
on one hard, he was a civilian but on the other, he was aware of
microphones in the U.S. =cbassy. These facts indicate that if she
was brigiec ry the KGB to report to American Intelligence on ¥05-
SY 2s inadequately prepared. Otherwise, however,
: Fersenally supportes the bona fides of NOSEVKC'
by offering earect confirmation of the bona “fides 5 of | CHEREPANOV,
by corroborating NOSE%KC's cetails on the he PENKOVSKIY compromise,
and by verifying his identification of KGB Second Chief Director-
ate personalities.

: Note: Aside from her support of NOSENKC and CHEREF ANOV,
: there are many aspects of the case which in-
depercently led CIA and other Western services to conclude
that she is a KCB-aispatched agent. Some of these aspects
are as follows:

- The circumstances of her claimed. ‘relationship with
the KGB contradict KGB practice as known frem other sources.
