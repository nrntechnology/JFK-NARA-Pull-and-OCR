2. Subjects’a and b are sisters and. ‘were questioned together...
the topic of reception. of. radio: programs. in ‘Cuba, both, were agreed
the best reception was the "Voz dé las Americas” which came ‘in str
_and clear with rarely any interference Jamming.. ‘Program content was
described ‘as. generally good, gave & morale boost to the audience and

. Was becoming Popular. :

.. 3. In comment ing on Radio Las. Americas, they: pointed out that
they. had not heard it or attenpted to tune In ‘because: the
quality was much the same as its predecessor, “Radio Swan" which lost
i its prestige prior”to and, ‘during the. April 1961 invasion attempt. Both
‘declared this was a general, opinion among their acquaintances.

. 4. Subjects commented very favorably on programs heard over
Station XEW, Mexico and’ WRUL, New York, describing reception and ‘con-
‘tent as good and with ‘large ‘audiences in. Cuba.

5. In referring to other programs, subjects reported that) on

1 May, relatives in‘the. Matanzas area-tcleplioned them in’ Havana to tell
them that the "students" (DRE) ‘wereon again (TV intrusion). Also,
later in the day, friends inti edado. area called to tell. them to

: tune into Channel, 2, that there was. 2 program theré (about. 2115: hours

“Jocal)’. unfortunately, they had ‘already ‘ sold their’ TV set since: they.

- were leaving soon... Both agreed that the system of announcing the TV

. intrusion broadcasts over CONTE Aguero’ S program.on WRUL a fow minutes
prior to the intrusion was the. key. to large audiences -Almost all .-
GOC oppositionists upon hearing this announcement, § tart, telephoning
their friends to tune Anto | the TV channe? aanounced.

6. Concerning the DRE thtcrnal ‘organization, Subjects” reported.”
: that they had. not been active recently and: not witting to clandestine”
operations. They: were aware, however, that. the DRE-intefnal net was~
waiting for the infiltration of AMHINT-53 or AMHINT-2. to’ brief. them on
the Situation in exile and what support: would be forthcoming. They.
reiterated the -reports on two bombs ‘set off in the university area by
the DRE: and burning of cane ‘and henequen fields in Matanzas ‘and: Lis
Villas. : : :

7. When queried on disturbances. in Las Villas and/or Matanzas on
or about 3 May, they replied thaw they Neard the persistent. rumor that |
a unit (company or regiment unknown) | of militia had bolted and gone
up into the Escambray Mountains. ‘No further details: were known,

} 8. When’ questioned on written propaganda such as S flysheets or.
: Clandestine newsheets, both declared that the last propaganda seen was
the: clandestine issue on “Trinchera” (DRE organ), that no other pro-

“paganda sheets ‘had been. seen since before the April Anvasiton. |

9. ‘When asked their impression, on anti-CASTRO propaganda an’
general they felt that it was ‘too negative; that while the exiles and
opposition groups were busy tearing down the imaye of CASTRO, he was
before the people with some proposal that was ‘based either on truth,
had a ring of truth in it, or at least appealed to the masses, That
some of the’ contacts with young girls who served as “brigadistas"
(rural .tutors in the campaign for literacy) turned up interesting |
remarks. _These girls claimed that-many of the country folk, would ‘throw

a rhein hands in dismay when Communism was mentioned to them, and:

toward that Sector of Cuban “that are not fanatic Fidelistas or
‘communists, and have not commited, themselves ‘to the opposition ovement!
“for such reasons as indolence’,. ‘lack of courage, or economic docibility:
‘Raquel remarked that our propaganda seemed to be divided “into two. :
broad. categories, one directed at or attacking the hard- -core - Fidelistas
“and the: other for opposition movement consumption, |
