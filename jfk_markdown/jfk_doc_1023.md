Mr. Schwarz. Did you know Jack Ruby?

Mr. Phillips. No, I did not.

Mr. Schwarz. Do youknow him under the name of Ruben-

Mr. Phillips. I did not.

Mr. Schwarz. What did you do between your work in Cuba
and the Chile matter which you weré going-to..spend most of your
time on?

Mr. Phillips. After the Bay of Pigs business I went to
Mexico in late in 1961, and remained in Mexico until the very
early part of 1965, when I was assigned to the Dominican

Republic ¢

Mr. Schwarz. And then ~=-
Mr. Phillips. I stayed in the Dominican Republic until
the summer of 1967. Fs

the Chief of Cuban Operations through 1969.

Brasilia from Rio de Janiero.

In 1972 I went to Venezuela has vth

And in the summer of 1973 I was asked to return as Chief of
the then Western Hemisphere Division.

or the other which would enable you to form a judgment as
to his attitude toward either the subject of assassination or
the question as to what kind of an explicit order would be
necessary in order to justify Agency actions to actually
assassinate some one.

Mr. Phillips. No, because I never heard Mr. Helms even
get that close to the edge of such talk about such and such an
option or possibility, I never heard him talk that way.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever hear anybody in the Agency
talk that way?

Mr. Phillips. Under traumatic conditions I have heard
human beings maybe with a few drinks or something like that
saying, my God, we would be better off if so and so were
bumped off or something.

But I have never heard two officers sit down and
seriously talk about such an option. And if anyone has ever '
said that, it is the same way some people might get out of line
and say almost anything.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever hear, in connection with

the Chile operation, that certain Chilean officers, specifi-

cally a Major Marshall ,@ge “jthat they intended
to assassinate Allende?
Mr. Phillips. It was five years ago. But as I recall,

Major Marshall said a- number of things. He was what I think

of as a wild man. I seem to recall something about, yes, a

Mr. Schwarz. And you offered through(Colonel Wimery,
whom we will come to in a moment, $50,000 if they could
accomplish it, didn't you?

Mr. Phillips. I think that was the correct sum, yes.

mr. Schwarz. And you gave them prior to their attempt
on the 19th of October some tear gas and some gas masks to
help accomplish the kidnapping?

Mr. Phillips. That is true.

Mr. Schwarz. And subsequently you provided to the Val-
enzuela group some machine guns, didn't you?

Mr. Phillips. That is ture.

Mr. Schwarz. - And those were going to be used ina
kidnapping effort by the Valenzuela group, and you knew that,
didn't you?

Mr. Phillips. I recall that they were going. to be
used by’ the group, and that kidnapping was a part of their
plans. I can't recall that they said they needed them spe-
cifically for the kidnapping. I do recall that the reason was -|

need arms when they have got arms everywhere all over Latin

Consequently, I personally made this proposal, that we
establish what I called a false flag base of people that would
go from outside, and should there be any sort of flap, the

chances of linking it to the U.S. Government would be much

less, because they would appear to be from another nationality. |

Mr. Schwarz. I would like to read to you a cable -- is
this cable of 27 September in the Senator's book? I know that
he asked for it after I came over.

Mr. Treverton. It is not.

Mr. Schwarz. I am going to read from a cable which
unfortunately is not in your book, but the key part is
relatively simple.

This is a cable, Mr, Phillips, dated September 27, 1970,
and it is signed by yourself and Mr. Broe. And it is sent to
the Station in Chile, and it contains the following about the
purposes of setting up the false flag office =--

Mr. Phillips. We call it a base.

Mr. Schwarz. False. flag bases: "Each member of base
will enter and leave Chile with falst documents and operate as
a representative of his country rather than as anAmerican",

That is right, isn't it?

Mr. Phillips. That is: true.

However, that was it. It was a
devious move. It was the final result -- the idea being that
if such a flap did occur, someone would think it was someone
other than the U.S. The idea of false flag operations is
not a new one. The idea I had of going to someone and saying,
why don't you be a spy for us, I don't work for the Soviets,
is not true.

But this is sort of new, the fact that action agents
should pose as others. And yes, it is devious, but that
was the idea. .

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Phillips, what were

their instructions if they were to be caught? Were they to go

to their death swearing they were fpraziul } or whatever?

Mr. Phillips. I don't think it was quite that dramatic,
Senator. They came to Washington before they went down. And
I briefed them,and I think what ot said to them was, this
is going to be a teiigh and sensitive one, and you don't have
to go if you don't want to, because you culd get in real trouble.

‘And if you get in trouble, I am not sure we can help
you.

So, they shrugged their shoulders and went.

Mr. Phillips. It never occurred to us in our wildest
dreams to do that.

Mr. Schwarz. I suppose the relationships between con-
tinuing intelligence services were things that were
very: important to preserve, and that we had very close and
delicate relationships with the é6étheriintelligence services.

Mr. Phillips. We do. And if there had been such a

ans would be quite unhappy with us. But I

thought that was better than letting the world know that was
a U.S. Citizen down there.

Mr. Schwarz. You go on in the cable of September 27
to say this: .

"Headquarters believes this false flag was manned by
officers who have repeatedly proved their ability to operate
and recruit under false colors, will give Station great flexi-
bility in handling delicate and fast-moving situations secure-
ly."

So, the use of false flag persons, at least judging
from this cable, is something repeatedly done by the CIA?

Mr. Phillips. Yes, and by all intelligence services --_
not all, but all major intelligence services. If you are living
overseas and a man comes up to you and‘says, hey, I see you
are a Marxist, and a man comes up and says, I am from Havana

and we would like you to work with the Cuban intelligence

service, he might not be from Havana, he might be from the

Soviets, from us, orf

So, it is not an unusual practice.

Mr. Schwarz. Incidentally, you just let drop one thing
in your testimony a moment ago. You said that in your 25-year
involvement with intelligence matters you had been bothered
by your activities on only two occasions, one of which was
Chile.

And then you said what the other one was. What was that?

Mr. Phillips. I was in Washington attending the Chiefs
of Station course, which is a training course for people who
are going out on their first assignment as Chief of Station.

When President Johnson decided to send 22,000 Marines
to the Dominican Republic, it occurred to me that in order to
protect and evacuate American citizens, that that job might
have been done with 400 Marines. I was scheduled to go there
And I just wasntt sure that I
wanted to be associated with something like that. But I de-

cided, well, I suppose President Johnson knows what he is

along.

Senator Schweiker. One question on your differentiation
between where you drew a personal commitment line on assassin-
ations, but not overthrow. I have trouble quite understanding

it, because as I understand Chile, the plot was to overthrow

Mr. Phillips. There is no question that I could under--
stand why anyone concerned with world affairs, looking at
Chile and what was happening there, would be concerned.

Salvadore Allende made his first statement saying that
he was a Socialist and wanted to change the order some 32
years beforehe was elected.

Over the years he made it quite clear that he was an ar~
dent socialist. Before this decision was made I believe that
we had a visit from a man who had the code name of guavas he
was a Cuban:.intelligence officer. The Cubans were moving in
rapidly. The influence was great. I think that they saw a lot
at stake, another Cuba in Latin America type of thing, the
same thing perhaps that motivated President Johnson to send
22,000 rather than 400.

So,I:can understand why they thought this was going,
in the long strategic sense, in the long range against.:our
interests. But that is an assumption.

It is true that Allende very definitely made it clear
that he wanted to turn Chile into a Marxist state. The differ-
ence was that Allende refused to take Fidel Castro's advice
and use violence. As I understand it, Fidel Castro went to
Chile and said, if you want your revolution to last you are

going to have to use violence.
I found it interesting to read in this morning's paper

where someone from Portugal came back from Cuba and said,

Mr. Phillips. No, sir. I was (tes@sEeaesion:

six or seven weeks for what we are referring to as Track II.
Senator MOndale. Now, in that position you familiarized
yourself with the Chilean government, Allende and so on,
and tried to become as expert as you could in the political
forces and so on?
Mr. Phillips. Yes. And in addition to that, Senator,
one of the reasons I was called back was that I had lived
for many years in Chile, so I knew something about it.
Senator Mondale. And itis:your: judgment as I think I
just heard, that although Allende was a Marxist, and espoused
Marxism, he also said he wanted to achieve this through the

democratic process, and although there was some rough stuff

on the press, and s0 on, essentially that was the course he
was pursuing, is that correct?

Mr. Phillips. I don't recall that he said it, but
he. indeed acted that way.

Senator Mondale. But in fact the course he was pur-~
suing was an attempt to achieve the Marxist philosophy with
the population support under constitutional system? be
Mr. Phillips. Yes, essentially that is true,- sir.

assignment by the President and by the White House?

Mr. Phillips. Senator, it doesn't make any difference
today. On the contrary, since Watergate the people say, why °°.
should we? Before Watergate it was another ball game.

The President was the Commander in Chief in every sense of the
word.

And you said, who am I, a GS-15 bureaucrat, to say that
we shouldn't do this? But that has changed since Watergate,

Senator Hart of Colorado. One other question.

I call your attention in our briefing books to what is
fab C, a cable which has your name at the end of it dated 21
September 1970, page 3 of 7. Are you an author or co-author
of that cable?.

Mr. Phillips. I believe I was the authenticating
officer, yes.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What does that mean?

Mr. Phillips. That meant that the signature on the
right of those cables is someone that is the authenticating
officer in a sense, here is a fellow that is supposed to know
the situation.

Senator Hart of Colorado. But who wrote it, I guess

Yee
is what I am after.

Mr. Phillips. I would guess that this cable was probably

written by Mes’ Pounzie, and perhaps myself, perhaps it was

mroiwrote an awful lot of them. But by

Senator Hart of Colorado. Page 3 of 7 which has
the paragraph identified as the paragraph F contains the follow-
ing sentence or part of a sentence: You suggest sending
us cables outlining objectives and course of events, et

cetera, and he said, always conditioned by the fact that we have

to keep our feet in the mud of practicality, and our eyes

What does that mean in Agency talk?

Mr. Phillips. Senator, I want to assure you with real
seriousness that I am not the author of that phrase.

Senator Hart of Colorado. It must have caught your eye,
however.

Mr. Phillips. It did catch my eye. If this was indeed

a joint venture, I can promise that that was

contribution, and if you ever meet him you will understand
why. He was addicted to picturesque speech. And - looking
back, all I can say is that it probably went out at four
o'clock in the morning, and we were very tired, and I just
didn't want to argue about that phrase, and I let it go. I
am not sure what it means even now. .

Now, I read that as Helms! position being that the
assassination of Schneider was something which presented the
opportunity for the very thing that the U.S. wished to have
done.

Do you agree with me?

Mr. Phillips. No, I can't agree with you on that. I am |
not sure about the suggestion from the language. But I will
tell you the immediate reaction in our little task force when
the word came that Schneider was dead, that is it, it is *inishe
Knowing Chileans, the moment that that violence occurred,
Chileans, with the possible exception of a nut such as
Marshall, immediately said,this is it, that is enough. There
was still that tradition over the years. And I think that the
moment we heard of it and we discussed it we said, that is
it, there will be no more. In many countries in Latin America
that would have been the signal for further action, weakness,
and so forth. But in this case it was the end of the
business,

Mr. Schwarz. I want to run through with you the activi=
ties which were being undertaken with the Valenzuela group
and with the Viaux group. In the case of Viaux, was that one
of the assignments that the false flag officers had?

Viaux group was really acting in order to carry out step one
of the Valenzuela group's plan?

Mr. Phillips. Yes, to address this point specifically.

Obviously when the guns were passed shor ghacoveneiial

and the death occurred so soon after, immediately we
thought they probably used those guns. It was then when we
read the press reports that General Schneider died from hand-
gun wounds. And that was the first time we thought we could
really be sure in our own mind that it wasn't directly
the Valenzuela group using those guns.

Mr. Schwarz. What about the gas masks that had
been furnished earlier? WAsn't there evidence that there
were gas masks in the care of the persons who attempted to
abduct General Schneider?

Mr. PHillips. I don't recall. There may very well have
been, but I am not real sure about that.

Mr. Schwarz. I am going to go to another area, which

carried out on October 19.

Wm Witting of the above plan, has promised to keep
the Carabineros away from the Schneier houseto assure that the
abduction will not be interferred with. General Viaux is
knowledgeable of the above operation, but is not directly
involved."

What do you think "not directly involved" refers to?
Why not just not involved? .

Mr. Phillips. I think that probably referred to what
I was saying before, that in these situations it is not very
unusual that there is not some talk that everybody has a cousin
that works with some group type of thing.

And I believe that it must refer to that.

Mr. Schwarz. Taking the actual cable, is the actual
cable in the Senator's books?

Mr. Inderfurther. No.

Mr. Schwarz. Let me read the full text of that para-
graph from the cable. It is a cable apparently dated 19
October on the subject of General Viaux:

- "General Viaux, knowledgeable of above operation, but not
directly involved. He has been sent to Vina to stay with
prominent physician. Will be seen in public places during 19
and 20 October to demonstrate fact that above operation is
not his doing. Will be allowed to return to Santiago at end of

week."

Now, I can't read that language any way other than
meaning that the Valenzuela group and the Viaux group were in
close cooperation, that was part of the abduction plan, it
was agreed between the two that Viaux would appear -- would
be out of town so that he would not appear to be involved.
And you have to read that, do you not, as meaning that there
was a close cooperation on this effort between the two groups.

Mr. Phillips. Yes, I think.you. do have to read it that
way.

Miss Culbreth, Would you identify that paper more
than just the statement?

Mr. Phillips. Cable sent to headquarters A66.

Mr. Schwarz. No. A66, eyes only to --

the fact thatfé itl had been around Latin America,
spoke perfect Spanish, his hobby was riding horses, and he
developed really marvelous relationships with the military of
officers that he had contact with. And I think it was just
that someone recognized the fact that if we had been given the
task of getting a coup going using the military, why not take
advantage of tehemone cma: ein | bey that they liked the most,

for him to spend his weekends with these people.

saying, cooperate with the CIA. What the process

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever see Philpott ?

Mr. Phillips. I never did.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever see --

Mr. Phillips. I may have seen Philpott in some large
meeting or something like that, but I don't recall any
meeting with any of the generals. I was relatively too junior
to have attended these meetings. This would have been Mr..
Broe, Mr. Karamessines, and so forth. And I would have been
left back in the shop, sort of, I think.

Mr. Schwarz. And did you ever see or talk to Bennett?

Mr. Phillips. Not to my recollection. I think not.

Mr. Schwarz. I asked you if you ever saw General Phil-
pott, or did you ever talk to .General Philpott?

Mr. Phillips. I don't recall such a talk. During this

Mr. Schwarz. Is that the form in which you sent the
message which is contained in Exhibit 3 to Chile?

Mr. Phillips. It is.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, apparently Exhibit 4, which you
drafted initially, said that it was from General Bennett, and
then it was changed to say it was from General Philpott.

Did you make that change?

Mr. Phillips. That is my handwriting above that said
Philpott, and someone else's handwriting below that said
Bennett. I think the signature on the original document
was from Philpott. But that is my change there.

Mr. Schwarz. And is the change on the second page --
the sentence reads:

"

"Do not allow Srt¥ to retain copy of this

message", and then in handwriting it is asserted "Note that
General Bennett is out of the country".

Mr. Phillips. Yes, that is my handwriting.

Mr. Schwarz. Having seen that, and these changes, what
do you recall about the circumstances that led you to make
those changes?

Mr. Phillips. It‘is possible that this message is one
of the rare messages that sometimes occur, that you are handed
something that is written out, and there is no secretary,
and it is two o'clock in the morning or something like that.

I am not sure about that.

Mr. Schwarz. You think what you sent used General Ben-
nett's name and not General Philpott's name?

Mr. Phillips. I don't recall. But I believe if that had ~
been the case that not only would the change have been made,
but there would have been some sort of note on the side or
something. So, I believe that the original must have said
Philpott. But I can't be absolutely positive.

Mr. Schwarz. But the original typed version on::the
first page used Bennett's name, right?

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, I am puzzled, because if you had
previously obtained the document which is Exhibit 3, the

from General

“suggested message to be sent
Bennett", and which is in fact signed with a name that
purports to be General Philpott's, if you had obtained that
before drafting the typed message, I take it you would have used
Philpott's name in the typed message and not Bennetts’.

Mr. PHillips. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. . So that suggests that you typed the typed
message before you obtained the document which is Exhibit 3
that has Mr. Philpott's signature?

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And what is your best recollection as to
who handed you that document?

Mr. Phillips. I cannot say definitely who did that.
There were many occasions when Bill Broe would walk into the
office and say, here is something to send. There were others
which would come in a manila envelope with a yellow
forwarding slip on it. There are times,I am sure, when I
would go into Bill Broe's office, and he would say, by the
way, send this.

I simply cannot recall the circumstances -in which some-
one handed me that and. said, send it to Chile. And I was paying
less attention to those things, because I was in effect the
postman for people doing other things.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any recollection at all
about this document?

Mr. Phillips. No, I am afraid I don't.

Mr. Schwarz. What is your reading of the signature on
that document?

Mr. PHillips. Well, it certainly looks like the sig-
nature which was on the other document which was said to be

Philpott's. But I am not an authority on these things.

not to say to these new people, by the way, we want to talk

Mr. Schwarz. That is an explanation that deals with
some of the earlier documents. But here in the first place
you were both the releasing officer and the authenticating
officer. .

And second, this is not simply taking some other message

I don't see myself releasing that cable without being sure that
Broe knew what was going out in that cable. In other words,
that is hthe kind of cable that I wouldn't have released
just because someone else came in and said that sort of thing.
This cable I think must have originated either with a dis-

write up something like this, or perhaps some notes, and say,

do a cable from it, or just as possible -~ and I can't read it

interested parties and the several persons referred to in
the two sentences are persons who were in higher authority
than Bennett and Philpott?

Mr. Phillips. I assume that, but do not know. I just --

I thought that they would go outside and up. But I say, I

you now describe it, is one that is kind of ticklish, isn’t it?

Mr. Schwarz. The CIA had been usingfW and knew

of it, General Bennett and General Philpott feel that they are

embarrassed to refute the fact that they had already been doing

the work for the CIABE

Now, all those things were not ordinary garden variety
daily events, were they?

Mr. Phillips. They were not.

Mr. Schwarz. You don't remember this at all?

Mr. Phillips. No, and I didn't want to imply that it
was necessarily because General Philpott would have been
embarrassed, it could have been within CIA as well.

But this rather unusual step was made because of the
talents of the military men, to bring him into a program
that you weren't even talking with the State Department about.
And so that indeed was unusual to a great degree. And I am
really very sorry to appear to be so vague about these things
that I obviously had something to do with.)

But my explanation is that I was doing a certain job,
and that other’ people were outside, and Mr. Karamessines would
be talking with Mr. Helms about something, and this, that and
the other, and I was on the day-by-day operation side, and when
someone would come in and say, we want something to go down
to Wimert, and it has something to do with General Philpott,

I didn’t pay the kind of attention I would to it if it had

been one of our operations.

Now, there are two ways in'’which those words “for his

background.

The other is that it is a story to be given é for
his information, which is the fact, if you know, and which way
doyou read it if you do not know what the facts are?

nowhere during this period did I encounter anything, nor do
I remember anything that I thought was devious to the extent
‘of falsehood in putting something down like that.

what happened.

Mr. Schwarz. And you don't remember from where you got
the information which you provided in this cable?

Mr. phillips. I do not. Perhaps I can be more helpful
after you talk to others. But I simply do not.

Mr. Schwarz. The last paragraphs make the notation

Mr. Schwarz. Can you tell from the face of it, are we
correct that this is a document that was sent from the CIA
station in Santiago to CIA headquarters purporting to come

from § # and purporting to be directed to Lieutenant

General Bennett?

Mr. Phillips. That is true.

Mr. Schwarz. In the ordinary course to whom would
such a cable go? And the second question, who would have the
responsibility of passing information on to General Bennett?

Mr. Phillips. In the ordinary course of events this cabld
would have come to me where I was working in the sense of an
info copy and this, that and the other.

The action on this cable would have certainly have gone
at least to Mr.Broe, and possibly higher, because it says,
this is his message to the head of another government
service. And so it would have gone to that level.

Mr. Schwarz. And in the ordinary course it would have
come to you first, and then it would have been passed on to
either Mr. Broe or someone higher to take action?

Mr. Phillips. For action -- not always. Sometimes a

cable will come in and there will be more than one copy.
And right away the action copy will go to the other fellow, and
then you get the information copy, and so forth.

Mr. Schwarz. Can you tell from the face of this cable

whether there would have been more than one copy?

Mr. Phillips. There is no indicator to say who it went
to.
Mr. Schwarz. Does the"eyes only“have any significance
to you in the third line?

Mr. Phillips. Only in the sense that what}

Wmerty was saying was, this may go over to the Defense Depart~
ment, but not through regular channels, and not to anyone else
other than General Bennett.

Mr. Schwarz. Did it go to General Bennett?

Mr. Phillips. I do not know.

Mr. Schwarz. And did’ you pass it to someone?

Mr. Phillips. If it did not go it would have been
highly unusual for amessage to come in from overseas saying,
give this to the head of another Agency, and for it not to
be delivered it would have been extremely unusual.

Mr. Schwarz. What wouldle the normal form of its
delivery? Would there be a cover note put on it?

Mr. Phillips. | It would have probably been folded
into an envelope and delivered by hand. Because if it is
really an "eyes only" message of such import, if it goes
through a communications channel, it means that they are going
to be operators of machinery to see it, and so forth. . If
an American Ambassador overseas wants to get a very sensitive
message up he has the option of sending it to us and saying,

will you please hand carry this over to the Secretary of State?

Mr. Schwarz. And they don't really have anything to

do with that, do they?
Mr. Phillips. I would gather from this message that

it is simply an explanation from -- it says General Bennett

{, to explain something. As a part od Track I, and the
whole business, all of these different options were being
looked at and people were saying, let's don't help them with
military things because it looks like Allende is going to get
in. And the decision: was made, well, let's go ahead

and do it. And this was apparently sort of a request for

4 to give him some rationale behind it when he

was down there running - away trying to foment the coup,
saying, why is the U.S. Government still helping this govern-
ment?

I am speculating. But this was another one of those
messages quote unquote which went in our channels.

Mr. Schwarz. Who gave you this message?

Mr. Phillips. I do not remember.

Mr. Schwarz. You have no recollection whatsoever?

Mr. Phillips. Sir, it is five years ago, and there are

a lot of messages, and as I said, these were the ones that

I was the least interested in in the sense of being involved,
and so forth, and I just can't remember who handed it to me
or how it arrived.

Mr. Fenn. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. Talking about telephones, incidentally,
was there a secure telephone between Washington and Santiago
which was used for messages, or did you use the cable always?

Mr. Phillips. We never used the telephone, unless it is
a personal message like your aunt died and you have to get on
the next plane for the funeral. Otherwise you use those
absolutely marvelous communications facilities that get it
down there --a: flash cable will get there in 20 minutes.

In the recess I have been thinking about this, and I re~-
alize that I have not been very helpful in what obviously is
a contradictory situation here. As I read it, either General
Bennett does not recall this, or else there was some sort of
endeavor within CIA headquarters to use his name. Is that
the approach we are making to this?

Mr. Schwarz. I don't think we are trying any approach.
He has denied any knowledge of this.

Senator Schweiker. We are just confused.

Mr. Phillips. Maybe I am confused, too.

Senator Schweiker. Can you enlighten us at all?

Mr. PHillips. If it were someone in CIA headquarters
saying, we are going to use Bennett's name without his

knowledge because it has a lot ‘of clout, I don't understand

why. Because the messages went from Philpott é

that moment began cooperating with the Chief of Station. I don'lt
recall any instance where there was any indication of hesitancy
on his part about doing what he was doing.

And I certainly can't comment about General Bennett's
side, not having been involved with him.

From the CIA side I suppose it is conceivable that some-
one is using that business that I referred to in dispatches,
General Bennett says, when they are really talking about
what a subordinate of General Bennett says, and they figure
he is acting for them, or something like that. I guess that
is conceivable.

But I would find it very unusual to see some sort of
little plot hatched here, because there was no need to.

Mr. Schwarz. What you are saying is that you can't see

a motive?
Mr. Phillips. Precisely.

I can't see the motive for fooling}

fhad already started working when he re-

ceived the instructions from the number two man in his Agency,
which is indeed pretty high up.

So, I am afraid the reasons that I am not being helpful
is that I, too,’ am confused.

Mr. Schwarz. I just received a note indicating that
Mr. Bolten of the Agency has told us that both of the October

14 cables were authored by you. I don't know if that adds

Senator Schweiker. Let me ask counsel this.

Can we establish that Philpott did communicate --

Mr. Schwarz. Philpott is going to testify on Tuesday.
We have talked to him.He accepts at least one message. There
are two which purport to be signed by him, and he is not
sure if he accepted two.

Senator Schweiker. So, he has accepted one message?

Mr. Schwarz. He accepted one message, yes.

Mr. Phillips. You wanted to ask about a meeting.

“Mr. Schwarz. It was a final meeting you had with Helms?

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

The death of General Schneider had occurred. And while,
as we said previously, things bad fallen into place according
to "plan", an egregious plan, it was absolutely my conviction
that those orders that I had been predicting, which were very,
very slim, were now completely unacceptable, one reason being

that the inauguration was going to be in 48 hours -- not the

.-inauguration, but the confirmation, and so forth.

And so as I recall, there was a meeting of quite a few

of us, probably myself andf Zioyand Mr. Broe and Mr.

Karamessines, and maybe Mr. Flannery, -~ no, I guess not, but

.I do remember thatmeeting going up there and saying, if there

ever was a chance, it is now finished, and somebody has got to
say that it is finished. And so that is what I meant by that

meeting.

when he looked up and he saw a bunch of people standing
around his car he drew his gun.

Miss Culbreth. Thank you.

I would like to direct your attention to this cable
that you were questioned about. It is the one that is dated
September27, 1970. And Mr. Schwarz read from that cable in

talking with you earlier. This was the cable which said "A ~

- false flag base of staff would be established in Santiago by

10 October".

And you were questioned about: this. part: "These
officers will perform the delicate chores with great flap
potential which cannot be done by station personnel or any
Chilean. An example: We have a (Ganadwan who can pose as

intelligence officer. If he approached, funded and

In the second paragraph which was not read earlier,

I would like to read this and then put a question to you:

“Headquarters believes this false flag base, manned by
officers who have repeatedly proved their ability to operate
and recruit under false colors, will give station great
flexibility in handling delicate and fast-moving situations
securely".

To me this second paragraph indicates that these false
flag officers were people that had experience in this very

kind of intelligence operations, is that correct?

Mr. Phillips. Every one of them was known to me per-
sonally and had worked for me.

Miss Culbreth. And had been in this kind of capacity
as a false flag officer?

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Miss Culbreth. , So,this was not some unique and unusual,
devious approach or mechanism that was being employed in this
instance?

Mr. Phillips. The purpose of that explanation, es-
pecially the second paragraph that you read, was -~ the imme-
diate reaction, as I recall, from the station when they first
heard that we were given their assignment, was, come on,
that flap potential is great, it is not going to work, what
are you talking about, this, that and the other.

As ai matter of fact, as I recall, Gen,

# was terribly upset, because he is a sort of
an old pro, and he wanted to get into position, in other words,
to plan for the future, and all of a sudden this new thing

came in. The purpose of that cable was to explain to the

station that we had been given this job to do and that we

at headquarters saw that as the safest way for them to
accomplish the job that they had been given with the least
possibility of embarrassing the American Ambassador, and that
sort of thing.

5 was a delineation or a demarcation of function between the

6 Viaux group and the Valenzuela group, or did you regard them
7 as one big group down there accomplishing this, or did you really
8 regard them as separate groups?

9 Mr. Phillips. I very definitely regarded them as two
10 separate groups, always with the caveat that in Latin America

11 || some one always has a cousin who talks to someone else.

12 But I very definitely regarded them as two separate groups,
