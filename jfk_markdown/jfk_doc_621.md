1.° As you may know, we are in the process of reviewlog the empleo

history and current career field of ail enployees-in-the Agency to i ity
those who c eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retiren nt Disubility System. In this process, tie Initial review of

each case is made by the individual's Career Service. If tie Head of his
Career Service nominates him for participati in the Systeni, this nominas
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
to me. However, if the Head .of the Career Service udvises that the empicyee
does not meet the basic requirements of 20-50 for partic! fon, I
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Bo:
This practice hus been udopted in the Interest of expediting this sere
process so iat those employees who are eligitle to partielpate dne the

tmeut the requirements of HR 20-50 ror designation as ad partici-
Ve accordingly mude the formal Geterminution required by the

record it appeurs that the decision of your Career Service was based upoa
the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as
yet performed 60 months of qualifying service a3 required by regulation. Hy
determination that you are not eligible at this time for designution in nc -
way affects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement Systex,
nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibility to participate

“the CIA System if you should meet the requirements for designation in the

future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning tt requirenen nts
for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that
you read parngraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Exployee Bulletin
dated 30 ‘July 1965, entitled "Public Law 83-43, The Central Intelligence

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determinati
made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding you

invaluable. in (1) the preparation of operational proposals

' for. the 303: Committee, (2) the provision of timely operational

information periodically requested by the front offices of
both WH/€OG-and WHD, and-(3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

“newly assigned to JMWAVE to assist in these operations. While

under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,

“cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed all

tasks assigned to him in an exceptional manner, He always
expressed hiS.willingness to work as many hours as necessary
to finish.the task at hand. He has a very pleasant person-

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

As noted in the last Fitness Report,

supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; put I
must again note that these are duties which could be performed by a
more junior clerical type and that Mr, Vitale should not be considered
ag performing GS-8 level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. . Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such a role

. and his official position title should be changed to prevent any
misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value to

the Agency.

For approximately four. months during 1967, Mr. Vitale

_ ‘worked with me in providing Headquarters' support to JMWAVE
Sin itS conduct of special operations into PBRUMEN. In such

a role, Mr: Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanics,—-
requirements and ‘PBRUMEN personnel of these operations was
invaluable in (1) --thé preparation of operational proposals
for the 303. Committee, (2) the provision of timely operational

‘information, periodically requested by the front. offices of

both WH/COG and WHD, ‘and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel _
newly assigned to JMWAVE-to assist in these operations. While
under my supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal,

cooperative employee who readily and willingly performed all

tasks assigned to him in an exceptional manner, He always
“expressed his willingness to work as many hours as necessary

TONMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the
supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; but I
must again note that.these are duties which could be performed by.a
more junior clerical type and that Mr. VitaJe should not be considered
as performing GS-& level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient
rating. Indeed, he is, in my opinion, not qualified for such, a roie
and his official position title should be changed to prevent uly
misunderstanding as to the somewhat unique nature of his value .to

the Agency.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL ~ .
, I have. had opportunity to observe subject's performance closely

for nine months and while I generally concur in his supervisor's ratings
of the duties as listed, it should be noted that these same duties could
be performed ecually well by a more junior Intel Clerk or Intel Assistant
and, therefore, the overal] rating as a GS-8 Intel Assistant does not
accurately reflect, his capability. In my opinion it would be very diffi-
cult, if not impossible, for subject to perform competitively with other |
Intel Assistants at a GS-8 level, and I recommend his position title be
changed to Ops Support Assistant, a role in which he performs. capably.

During the past year subject has continued to be a most cooperative,
loyal and willing worker:onm a project that due to its nature is more
frustrating, and demands more with less apparent return than most:
projects. As on his previous fitness report, I I have rated him very cee
high, primarily due to the fact that bel Singeeee ‘and ‘many years ex-

perience with the Agency have made him cf much more immediate value

than most 6€ his collegues in the 3S 7-9 level. Consequently, although

he has made’ G3-8 within the past year, I fcel he is still undergraded

Subject bas done’ an exceptional job in assisting his office in the.
formulation of reports and. plans by his research and ability to quickly
make name. traces“and ferret out information from the various agency sources
- Concerned. Lo . :

-" He af all times bas been a most cooperative, loyal and willing worker

. with good security habits. - Althotgh, he does not have the ambition or drive
to get to the top of the ladder that many younger officers may have (not
everytody can or wants to be Chief, but can still ‘be one of the best indians
itn the business), ‘bis great: sture of general knowledge and many years of

ve made him of snich more immediate value than most of

agency experience ha
his colleagues in the GS-7-9 level, and it is because of this that he
has received such a high rating. Consequently, it is recommended that

Mr. Vitale be promoted to the next higher grade at the earliest opportunity.

This employee had no qualifications for assignment in the German desk or,
German operational field. He was carried in the German Branch ina
casual status while an assignment suitable to his talents was being located.
The fitness report for the period of his. duty with the German Branch is
accordingly only a record of the fact that he loyally and diligently carried
out assigned tasks to the best of his ability. :
