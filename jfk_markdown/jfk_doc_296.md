Chairmen of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, has
scored the new State Department regulations on passports, claim-
‘ing they would allow Reds denied passports to "rifle freely the

top legal adviser when Bowles was Governor of Connecticut.

6. Samuel WISE, “Counsel in the American Embassy in Moscow" who
is referred to above, may well be Samel Griffin WISE Jr., #74574,
SD & SSD, who apparently was once a contract employee on (ARACTIVE.
[The State Department reviewed WISE's file on 2 June 1954; and as of
September 1962 a Samuel G. WISE was Second Secretary of the American”
Embassy in Moscow. At that time WISE advised in a cable to the State
Department that it appeared that Bruce Frederick DAVIS, #352267, who
defected from the United States Army in Germany on 18 August 1960, had
not expatriated himself. DAVIS' case is very similar to that of
OSWALD; and he, like OSWALD, lived in the Soviet Union for two years
after his defection and prior to making application for return to the
United States./

7. WISE was an applicant for CIA employment in early 1953 and
was security approved subject to polygraph on 11 August 1953. He did
not enter on duty and in September 1953 the office which had been
interested in him was "no longer interested". On 13 November 1953,
WISE was granted a CSA to permit his-use as a contract employee on
(ABACTIVE in New York City. His CSA was cancelled on 2h March 1958.

during an investigation of the latter for possible CIA employment” in 1952.
WISE, according to MUNSELI's landlady and social acquaintance in Washington,
D.C. during the period of about a year which ended in April 1952, was the
only person she knew by name with whom(MUNSELD.was friendly. According
to the informant, WISE was a student at Columbia University whose address
was 423 Furnald Hall. (MUNSELT) was Security disapproved for CIA employment
in June 1952 because of his chose association on a professional and social
basis, while attending Denver University from 19h6 + to 1951, with persons
of questionable loyality. In November 1954, CMONSELL was of interest to
project PFALLVE with reference to assignment to: ‘Dhahran, ‘Saudi wdi Arabia}
however, the interested office withdrew their request on hin, m, after
Security advised of the derogatory information regarding him.

9. WISE from 1951. to 1954 attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale,
New York, which was attacked by a Citizen's Group, which alleged Communist
influence in the school system. He had several questionable associates in
