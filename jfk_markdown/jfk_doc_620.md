letter of Tax Instruction for FEINGLASS/CAZAZZUS

er Oy _ Based on atscusdiona held with tax representatives ‘of the Organt«
cation, ry assceoment of your Organizational income has been approved to
satisfy your Federal tax obligation.

2. The asseasnent computation is based on en estimate of your taxadle
corpensation from the Organization and your estimate of other income from
outside cources. The assessment computation results in a percentage of
your salary being vithheld each pay period to compictely satisfy your tax
obligation. For tex-year 1907 thirteen and nincstenths (13.9) per cent |
will de withheld, effective 23 Auguat 1967. The computation is attached.

3- In copputing your assessment rate, you have been granted @ dasic

tax credit of $250. 00. This credit 1s not guaranteed, but is granted to

givo reasonable assurance that you will not pay a higher tax than yu
would under ordinary reporting procedures. ; :

A Future changes in your income or tax status may justify a revision
of the assessment rate. In this event this agreement would be amended

‘ accordingly.

S$. It 49 important that you file a tax return directly with Internal
Revenue that is consistent with your cover status. Care and accuracy in
preparing this: return are necessary. Any tex liability resulting fron
the tax computation on this return will be satisfied by your own funds.

A certified true copy of this tax return must be forwarded to uo upon .
your submission of the origtnal to Internal Revenue. Provided below are
epecific criteria to assist you in the preparation of the tax return:

Ae You will be provided with the name of a notional organita-
‘tion to be used on your 1967 tax return. Tha only income you will
report will be income shown on your (FEINGLASS) earning statement.
You will not report your wife's income or tax withholding nor will
you report any withholding that was made from your salary.

B, The income that ts shown {ustes the notional as a source)
will be reported on the Form 2555 (Statement to Support Exenption of
Income Harned Abroad) and will be exenpted from tax, due to your
residence overseas. You vill base your exesption on physical
presence abroad. For tax year 1967 you will report your income as
being earned prior to hom leave and therefore fully excludable
because the qualifying period, which ended on the date you lef
Mexico for home leave, included an eighteen-month pericd abroad.

C. Other incore must also be reported.on this tax return,
including interest from the Credit Union, vhich will be indicated
on without identifying the Credit Union by name.
14-00000

6. You may request an advance of funds for payment of foreign

” come or related (incon) taxes assessed against income received from

or guaranteed by the Organtration. Accounting far these funds will be
the form of copies of thé receipted tax bilis (ar other accepte

in
. @ble tax docusents) which will be forwarded to the home effice for appro=

val ond write-off of expense.

1. Please acknowledged tha original of. this letter and return to
