Thene's nothing outstanding about Tarasoff - just an averaze joe trying to make
a living and without the ambition, energy, perspicdity to make use of a saleable
article: knowledge of fiussian, Physically he's sort of scft, tends to be over-
weicht = he's about 5'8"tall, -ard about 190 in weight. ‘is personality is on
the negative side, his manner dull. : .

Tarasoff was greatly interested in the possibility of working for the US Govern-
ment, He wants that security. And ke has about reached end of the line
salary wise as a maintenance man or tuilding surcrintendent, Tarasoff is will-
ing to work in D.C, but insists on a GS 7 because he “29 to support a wife and ~

he is also able to put his experience and knowledge into words in
preparing character analyses which have been of great value to the.
Station's eperationnl program. Although his work load is often quite
heavy, he’ can always ‘be counted on to complete his assignments |
promptly and he’ willingly puts in the extra time frequently needed.

His team spirit and dedication are shown by the fact that on several
occasions, in spite of advancing age and recent illness, he spent long

_ the Station received the fine performance which has come to be routine
with him, This. officer's experience and dedication make it possible
for him to work effectively with an absolute minimum of supervision.

; Sponds instinctively to items of operational significance, and his
experience and knowledge aake it possible for him to write penetrating
analyses of target personalities, and interrelationships among these

persons, based 39lely on what he hears.
This officer has also been called upon to transcribe material from
audio operations, in addition to the telephone material which is his

“ normal assignment. He has also handled this well, although his advan-

cing age and less acate- hearing make this task much more difficult
for him...

While not called upon to use Spanish normally, he has sufficient
fluéney to handle material in Spanish when required.

‘This officer uses his time well and takes good care of the equip-

‘ment assigned to him. He does not handle operational funds nor does

he have any supervisory responsibilities.

« Reads Russian rapidly and looks out for material of interost to others as he
scans. Is adaptable and flexible and handles several different technical fields with
equal facility. Can tackle almost any subject without previous experience and turn out
a good job. His native knowledge of Russian is of considerable benefit to the whole
section. Selects the salient points from masses of ugéless or repetitive material with
intelligent judgment, and compiles reports which are pointed and concise. His only
deficiency. of any consequence is the slight awkwardness and occasional lack of clarity
nis written English style. His English has improved ccrsideratly during the past two
ears, but sometimes the failure to use the most precise term or the right connective
complicates for the reader a conception which is verfectly clear to the writer.

its employees who, as you know, are normally expected to retire when
they become eligible for a full annuity. The prospect of retirement
deserves serious thought and planning, and you should therefore know
that you will be eligible for retirement, according to our records,

during November, 1970.

2. Planning ahead-can bring about, with each passing year, definite
progvess taward.your.retirement goals. The Agency is anxious to assist
you in planning for your retirement. It is even more important, as an
ernployee, ‘that you begin now to plan for this occasion.

3. You deserve to know as much as possible about the general subject
of retirement and more specifically about the retirement policy itself,
your annuity, life and health insurance protection, opportunities for other
employment, Social Security benefits, and educational materials available
on the subject. The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory
service should be made available to you at least five years prior to the date

of your eligibility.

4. You are requested to call the Executive Secretary of the Board,
Mr. Howard G. Phillips, on extension 6872 to arrange an appropriate time
to diacuss any plans you may have and benefits available to you upon
