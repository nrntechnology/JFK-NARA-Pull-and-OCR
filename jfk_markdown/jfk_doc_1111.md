MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

(Prepared for tne Meeting of Friday, January 25, 1963, 4 p.m.)

FROM : Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

SUBJECT: United States Policy Toward Cuba

United States Policy

On November 20, the President set forth the broad guide-
lines of United States policy with respect to Cuba in | the
following words:

"As for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are
removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in
the future, under adequate verification and safeguards,
and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive
communist purposes, there will be peace in the

. Caribbean. And, as I said in September, ‘we shall
neither initiate nor permit aggression in this
hemisphere. ‘ ,

“We will not, of course, abandon the political,
economic and other efforts of this hemisphere to halt
subversion from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that
the Cuban people shall some day be truly free. But
these policies are very different from any intent to
launch a military invasion of the island.”

Maximizing the cost to the Soviet Union of
supporting the Castro regime;

Maximizing the political isolation of the
Castro regime from other free world states,
and especially from states of the OAS.
Whenever possible, U. S. actions against Cuba
should be multilateral, preferably based upon
the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)
or on resolutions adopted by the Crganization
of American States. The newly-won hemispheric
solidarity on the Cuban issue should not be
jeopardized by seeking OAS actions of marginal
value and which might split the hemisphere;

appropriate U. S. combat elements and/or
logistical support, the wide variety of
military contingencies that may arise from
pursuit of the foregoing objectives; and

Producing comprehensive intelligence related
to the above objectives.

To achieve the foregoing objectives, the

U. S. Government will be prepared to increase

military pressures, as appropriate opportunities
present themselves or can be created. The

actions listed below are those requiring immediate
approval and would be initiated in the sequence
set forth below. Recommendations for further

existing programs and upon the development
of new programs related to the. foregoing.
objectives will be forthcoming.

1. In addition to current covert program, such
as intelligencé collection, recruitment of
Cuban officials as agents, radio broadcasts,
support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council(CRC)
and other exile group activities and infil-
tration of propaganda materials:

a. Intensify covert collection
of intelligence within Cuba, -especially
within the regime;

b. Support the efforts of certain Cuban
exiles, who are associated with
the original aims of the 26 of July
Movement and who believe that the _
Castro regime can be overthrown: from
within in order. that they may:
1) cause a split in-the leadership
of the regime at the national or
provincial levels; and 2) create a .
political base of popular opposition ©
to the regime; and, 3) secure ;

c. Assist Cuban exiles in developing a
capability to launch balloons carrying
leaflets and other propaganda materials
from international waters into Cuba.

2. With respect to the actions listed below,
the results of Mr. Donovan's imminent
negotiations with Fidel Castro for freeing
the 20-cdd American prisoners should first
be ascertained. If these actions were taken
before the conclusion of the negotiations ©
they could jeopardize the release of the
Americans.

3. If these negotiations fail, or when the
prisoners are recovered, proceed on the
following timetable:

4. Inform NATO and OAS twelve hours in advance
of the proclamation of the four point
shipping orders. (The proclamation calls for
the orders to go into effect in five days).
These orders:

a. Close United States ports to all
vebsels of a country whose vessels
engage in carrying arms to Cuba;

b. Close United States ports to any ship
which has carried goods in the Bloc-
Cuba trade within 120 days of the time
it. seeks to enter a United States port;

c. Prohibit all United States flag ships
and all ships owned by United States
nationals or residents from entering

5. At the termination of the U. S. Chiefs of
Mission Conference - January 20-30, or at
a later date dependent on the Donovan
mission, Assistant Secretary Martin, or
another representative of the President
will visit the Presidents of Chile, Mexico
and Brazil to convey to them the importance
President Kennedy attaches to maintaining
hemispheric solidarity by their supporting
the following resolutions:

a. An OAS resolution condemning Cuba for
its actions which continue to endanger
the peace, deploring refusal to allow
inspection, condemning the presence of
Soviet troops, recommending continued
surveillance and continued vigilance
against subversive activities, and
terminating the invocation of the Rio
Treaty on the missile crisis, together
with

b. An OAS resolution which would
recommend 1) extension of arms embargo
to all items of trade except food and
medicine (fall back position: extension
of arms embargo to all strategic items);

3)* denial of Soviet over-flights and
transit rights for flights to Cuba; -
and 4)° a call on other states’ to -
take: similar action. *

After obtaining the | maximum possible
support of the key countries of Mexico,
Chile and. Brazil, the other OAS

members will be approached in Washington
and in their respective capitals,:
simultaneously. It should be possible
for this consultation and OAS ‘action on
the resotutions to be completed within
ten days. Prior to formal COAS approval
of. the resolutions, we will inform our’ -
NATO allies of the impending oas action.

At the first NATO meeting after ‘formal:

OAS action on the resolutions, we will
request that NATO include Cuba on the: ;

After | ‘NATO ‘deciéion on our cocom request’:
we will seek to get egreement from Free
World industrial nations -to prevent
shipping of critical spare parts and
equipment to Cuba, not on the COCOM list.

In addition to the four point shipping

resolutions, and action under Section

107 of the Foreign Assistance Act, continue
to press Free World nations to keep their
shipping out of ‘Blac- Cuba trade.

B. Contigency Planning

New opportunities for accomplishing our
objectives may arise either as a result of Bloc
action in other parts of the world; as a result
of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile actions)
by the Castro-Communist regime itself; or as a
result of uprisings or internal conflict within
Cuba.

Our contingency planning, which will be
undertaken immediately, should include preparations
for increased multilateral and/or bilateral :
political and economic measures, large scale use of
Cubans who are now inside Cuba; more extensive
air activity including both high and low level
flights primarily directed toward surveillance
and collection of intelligence, and which may also
have the effect of embarrassing the Castro
government and keeping the Castro forces on ,
continual alert; retaliatory measures, as
appropriate, including the imposition of a
POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in
other countries; severance of communic ations
to Cuba; major acts of sabotage on shipping
destined for Cuba and on key installations to
Cuba; intensive naval patrols; anc, ultimately,
the use of U. S. military force. To the extent
feasible, U. S. military forces employed against
Cuba should be accompanied by U. S. militarily-
trained free Cubans and by the armed forces of
those Latin American nations desirous of
participating in the U. S. effort.

Our programs should be designed to encourage
the Brigade members to melt back into the exile
community and engage in constructive pursuits
pending the liberation of Cuba. We should offer
them some special assistance but not to the extent
that they become a perpetual privileged class
within the community, Presidential action on their
behalf would single them out unnecessarily.

-tto Free World industrial nations to eliminate sale and
shipment of critical items from their Cuban trade.

Existing programs will be reviewed and further
recommendations made as necessary. Planning for the
variety of contingencies related to Cuba will be undertaken
at once. :

In addition to current covert programs such as
intelligence collection, recruitment of Cuban officials,
support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (ORC) and
other exile activities, infiltration of propaganda
materials, and radio broadcasts, the following are
recommended for approval and immediate initiation:

a. intensified covert collection of intelligence
within Cuba, especially within the regime;

b. support of Cuban exiles who are seeking to
return the 26 of July Movement to its

original aims.

NOTE: It should be noted that approval of the
foregoing actions may: impair our ability
-to.accomplish objective b. (Removal of |
remaining Soviet forces from Cuba) because
_ taking these actions could provide the
U.S.S.R. with rationale for maintaining

preparations

now so that we are able to seize opportunities for more :
positive action towards our ultimate objective of the overthrow of i
the Castro/Communist regime. These opportunities may arise ’
either as a‘result of Bloc action in other parts of the world, as a
result of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile acts) by the Castro/
Communist regime itself; or as a result of uprisings or internal
conflict within Cuba. We should-prepare contingency plans to deal
with these situations,

i . :
Our contingency planning should include preparations for large-
scale use of Cubans inside Cuba; more extensive air activity including
both high and low level flights primarily directed toward surveillance
and collection of intelligence, and which may also have the effect of ‘
embarrassing the Castro government and keeping the Castro forces on °
continual alert; retaliatory measures, as appropriate, including the
imposition of a POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in other
countries; severance of communications to Cuba; major acts of
sabotage on shipping destined for Cuba and on key installations in

Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and, ultimately, the use of U.S,
Military forces.

We should be in a position to respond with open military support
{to include such items as matericl, advisors, training, and Special
Forces support and, if neces sary, up to the full range of military
forces), to a request for aceigtonce from any anti-Castro/Communist
group or groups in Cuba which de-monstrate an ability to survive,
which threaten the present regime,
with those of the U.S,

and whose aims are compatible

To the extent feasible, U.S, military forces employed against
Cuba should be accompanied by U.S. militarily -trained free Cubans
and by the armed forces of those Latin American nations desirous of
participating in the U.S. effort, ;

In addition to these immediate actions, we should make
preparations now so that we are able to seize opportunities for more
positive action towards our ultimate objective of the overthrow of
the Castro/Communist regime, These opportunities may arise
either as a result of Bloc action in other parts of the world, as a
result of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile acts) by the Castro/
Communist regime itself; or as a result of uprisings or internal
conflict within Cuba. We should prepare contingency plans to deal
with these situations.

Our contingency planning should include preparations for large-
scale use of Cubans inside Cuba; more extensive air activity including
both high and low level flights primarily directed toward surveillance
and collection of intelligence, and which may also have the effect of
embarrassing the Castro government and keeping the Castro forces on
continual alert; retaliatory measures, as appropriate, including the
imposition of a POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in other:
countries; severance of communications to Cuba; major acts of
sabotage on shipping destined for Cuba and on key installations in
Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and, ultimately, the use of U.S.
military forces.

We should be in a position to’respond with open military support

(to include such items as materiel, advisors, training, and Special

Forces support and, if necessary, up to the full range of military ;
forces), toa request for assistance from any anti-Castro/ Communist ca
group or groups in Cuba which demonstrate an ability te survive,

which threaten the present regime, and whose aime are compatible

with those of the U.S.

To the extent feasible, U.S. military forces employed against
Cuba should be accompanied by U.S. militarily -trained free Cubans a
and by the armed forces of those Latin American nations desirous of
participating) in the U.S. effort.

ALTERNATIVE If

United States Policy oO ,

1. Our ultimate objective with respect to Cuba is
the overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime and ‘its
replacement by one compatible with the objectives of the
U.S. and, where possible, sharing the aims of the Free
World. To achieve this objective, the U.S. Government
will apply inereasing degrees of political, economic,

‘psychological and military pressures, as appropriate

opportunities present themselves or can-be created,
until the Castro/Commnist regime is overthrown.

.. 2 Our immediate objectives are to isolate the
Castro/Commmnist regime from the Free World and from
the Bloc; weaken it economically; promote internal
dissension, erode its domestic political support;
frustrate its subversive activities; negate its influence
in the hemisphere; increase the cost to the Bloc of
sustaining the regime; and obtain the withdrawal of Russian
troops from Cuba.

3. Iselating, undermining and discrediting the
Castro/Communist regime through the exercise of all
feasible diplomatic, economic, psychological and
covert actions may achieve the immediate objectives
and could create propitious conditions in Cuba for
further advance toward our ultimate objective,

4. We should be in a position to respondwith open
military support (to include such items as materiel,
advisors, training, and Special Forces support and,
if necessary, up to the full range of military forees),
to a request for assistance from any anti-Castro/Communist
group or groups in Cuba which demonstrate an ability to
survive, which threaten the present regime, and whose
aims are compatible with those of the U.S.

5. Invasion of Cuba by U.S. military forces, as
distinguished from military support upon request of
indigenous forces, should not be undertaken in the
absence of aggression or other Castro/Commmist and/or

Soviet

-~8~

Soviet actions that threaten the peace or security of the
hemisphere. This does not preclude appropriate U.S.
retaliation for isolated hostile acts by the Castro/
Communist or Soviet forces.

6. To the extent feasible, U.S, military forces
employed against Cuba should be accompanied by U.S.
militarily-trained free Cubans and by the armed forces
of those Latin American nations desirous of participating
in the U.S. effort.

7. Intensive, comprehensive and continuing in
gathering in depth on Cuba should be identified as
objective of the national intelligence effort.

8. Whenever possible, U.S. actions against Cuba
should be multilateral, preferably based upon theTTreaty
of Reciprocal Assistance (Ric Pact) or on resolutions
adopted by the Organization of American States. The

‘ newly-won hemispheric solidarity on the Cuban issue

should not be jeopardized by seeking OAS actions of
marginal value and which might split the hemisphere.

Overt and covert annexes of specific actions in am
support of this policy will be prepared.

Discussion

The active pursuit of our ultimate objective in-
volves a phased and controlled series of political,
economic, psychological and military actions. Such
actions might inclyde leaflet dropping; propaganda urging
sabotage, strikes, and opposition to the regime; psycho-
logical operations urging defections; large scale training
of Cubans in the U.S. and the use of such Cubans inside
Cuba; extensive air activity including both high and low
level flights primarily directed toward suyveillance and
collection of intelligence, and which may also have the

effect

9 SECRET

HW 50955 Docld:32276061 Page 53

oD am

effect of embarrassing the Castro government and keeping the
Gastro forces on continual alert; retaliatory measures, as
appropriate, including the imposition of a POL blockade;
harrassment of Cuban officials in other countries;

severance of communications to Cuba; major acts of

sabotage on shipping destined for Cuba and on key
installations in Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and,
ultimately, the use of U. S. military forces.

' Ie addition, this course of action would involve a

broad gamut of carefully timed political, economic, psy-

chological and covert actions, such as OAS sanctions,
Caribbean security arrangements, intensified surveillance
of and publicity concerning Castro/Communist subversive
activities in Latin America, application of Four Point
shipping restrictions and other economic sanctions, and

a series of actions designed to obtain, to the greatest
extent possible, multilateral approval of an participation
in the campaign to unseat the Castro/Comunist regime.

Thies course of action has the advantage ef attaining
the objective more rapidly and under more controlled
conditions than the alternative stated by the Coordinator.
indeed, this may be the only course of action that will
accomplish the ultimate objective. It involves greater
visks; and, in the short run, a greater expenditure of
money and material and far greater numbers of personnel.

From the standpoint of international politics, the

oo S. will probably be subjected to criticism for
aggression from the uncomaltted nations. It is difficult
“ts predict the reaction of the Latin American governments.

They may attack the U. S. for “intervening or they may react
favorably (as they did during the missile crisis). To a

large extent, the reaction of the nations throughout the

ee

world, and particularly the Latin American nations, will
depend upon how adroitly theee actions are handled. For
example, there may even be advantages to the fact that our
active policy and the courses of action under it may

eventually become impessible to conceal. If properly
handled, the overt aspects of this policy may serve not
only to mitigate any unfavorable reactions from other
countries, but alse to gain, particularly in Latin
Awserica, increasing appreciation of the threat of Castro/
Communist Cuba.

The active pursuit of our objective will make it clear
thet the U. &. will not permit the maintenance of a
communist base in the hemisphere. From the standpoint of
military posture, the more active approach may be
subjected to counteractions from the Sine-Soviet Bloc
elsewhere. As we increase the pressures on Castrvo/Communist
Cuba and the extent of cur commitment to overthrow the regime,
U. &. prestige becomegmore deeply involved. The further
we progress along this route, the more significant will be:
the loss ef U. S. prestige if we alter or abandon it.

The suceessful execution of this policy will require
careful timing and eccordination of our actions and the
development of detailed plans. While such plans would be
designed to bring about the overthrow of the Castro regime
within a given time frame for planning purposes, they
would have to be sufficiently flexible te accommodate
changes to the international situation.

In any case, at crucial points along the way, it will
be necessary for the highest levels of our Government to
review the actions already taken and those contemplated and
to assess the advantages of continued and escalated
activity against the disadvantages and dangers of such
activity.

Commitment to this course of action does not exelude

the possibility of actively pursuing the isolation of the
Castro regime from the Bloc.

(Prepared for the Meeting of Friday ., January 25, 1963, .P.m.).

FROM : Coordinator of Cuban-Affairs: «© *~

SUBJECT: United States Policy. Toward Cuba

United States Policy |

On November 20, the President set forth the broad guidelines

of United States policy with respect to Cuba in the following
words:
"As for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are
removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in
_ the future, under adequate verification and safeguards,
and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive
communist purposes, there will be peace, in the Caribbean.
And, as I said in September, ‘we shall~neither initiate
nor permit aggression in this: hemisphere. '
"We will not, of course, abandon the political, economic:
and other efforts of this hemisphere to halt subversion
-from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that the Cuban people

shall some day be truly free. But these policies are very

different from any intent to launch a military invasion of

the island.@”

Objectives

at once.

In addition to current covert programs such as
intelligence collection, recruitment of Cuban officials,
support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) and
other exile activities, infiltration of propaganda
materials, and radio broadcasts, the following are
recommended for approval and immediate initiation:

a. intensified covert collection of intelligence

COURSES OF ACTION

(1) Continue the coas/oc in being ‘under the Rio Treaty but

take no further action at present.

Considerations:

The Rio Treaty was invoked and the COAS/0C brought into being

for the specific purpose of considering the October missile crisis.
If the purpose is considered fulfilled, the COAS/OC should either
be terminated or its authorization enlarged to deal with changed
clreumstances.

(2) Under the Rio Treaty seek a resolution in coas/0C_ which

condemns Cuba for its actions which continue to endanger the peace,

deplores refusal to allow inspection, condemns the presence of
Soviet troops and recommends continued surveillance and continued
vigilance against subversive activities.

Considerations:

This would promote U.S. objectives vis-a-vis Cuba and would —
represent one feasible, approprite, immediate step following the
conclusion of the U.S.-Soviet New York talks.

‘Although the language would have to be negotiated, it is
believed that unanimity or near-unanimity could be obtained.

Recent statements by Cuban leaders calling for armed insur-
rection in Latin America would be exploited in this connection.

It could be criticized for not constituting sufficiently ;
vigorous action on the problem of Soviet troops, but it would put
the OAS on record against their continued presence in the hemis-
phere and dramatize Castro's continued military subservience to

_ the Soviet Union.

' (3) Terminate the COAS/OC on the missile crisis. This
would still leave COAS with its responsibilities under Resolutions
Tt and VIII of Punta del Este. (Which provided for a Special Consul-
tative Committee on Sgcurity and a Special Cound. tee to study’ ‘the
further suspension of trade.) ;

Considerations:

This step could be considered logical, since the COAS/OC was
called into being to deal only with the October missile crisis.

-3-

Taken by itself, this course of action might maise doubts
concerning the inter~American legal basis under which we are
continuing our surveillance.

Psychologically, if this were the only action taken, it would
appear as though the OAS considered the crisis over, the presence
of Soviet troops unimportant, and its principle of verification
surrendered (on-site inspection and re-introduction of offensive
weapons)

(4) Combine (2) and (3).

Considerations:

_ This combination of actions is feasiblesand is likely to
obtain unanimity or near-unanimity.

The termination of the COAS/OC makes strong language in the
resolution more acceptable to the "soft" minority.

Termination of the OOAS/OC, even accompanied by the proposed
resolution, is open to some of the criticism indicated under (3).
‘Much of this could be mitigated if, however, the action is accom-
panied by the action suggested in (9), which imposes economic
sanctions, : . :

(5) Seek .to enlarge the basis on which the Rio Treaty was

invoked to encompass the presence of Soviet troops and seek a
resolution in COAS7OG calling for their withdrawal. .

| Considerations:

With adequate consultation and preparation, we should be able
to obtain a substantial majority. .

Such action would’ give a better basis for urging such addi-

tional steps as (6) and (7) and (8).

It would seem undesirable to take this course by itself unless
we seriously contemplate taking some additional ‘strong enforcement

(6) In addition to (5), seek authorization under the Rio
Treaty for collective action, including the use of armed force,

to bring about the withdrawal of soviet troops in Cuba if the
- QAS call is not heeded. : °

Considerations:

Considerations: .

. This. action should be seriously considered only if we are
determined to use all possible means to obtain removal of Soviet
troops. :

While it should be possible with adequate consultation and
preparation to: obtain a substantial majority for further political
and ecoriomic sanctions to help bring about the withdrawal of Soviet .
troops, it would be difficult to-obtain the necessary 2/ 3 majority
for authorization of the. use of armed force.

Considerations: .

This would be consistent with general U.S. policy to increase
the isolation of Cuba, but contrary to some present policies :
encouraging the maintenance of certain diplomatic missions in Cuba.

Although we could probably obtain the necessary 2/3 vote for
such action (particularly if couched as a recommendation) it would
be stoutly resisted by Mexico and Brazil and opposed by Chile,
Bolivia and Uruguay, whose contrary arguments would have some appeal.

Probably no more than maximum of 1 5 votes could be obtained
for. this. — ‘ .

(8) Seek a resolution in the Coas/oc¢ to sever all economic,

and commercial relations and all communications with Cuba .
srobably possible only in conjunction with (5) or (11).-

Considerations:

The severance of all economic and commercial relations would
go beyond our current embargo on trade with Cuba which provides
for the exception on humanitarian grounds of the export from. the
U.S..to Cuba of certain foods, medicines, and medical supplies.
Such action would expose us to charges of inhumanity and would
probably nullify our. public statements that, we have no quarrel
with the Cuban people.

A number of telecommmications between Latin America and —
_Burope are routed through Guba. Prohibition of these services
would interrupt commnications vital to many of our Latin American
friends. Further, U.S. communications with Cuba should be main-
tained to facilitate the transmission of messages in the national
interest and those for humanitarian reasons. _

These

These considerations would make it extremely difficult to
obtain a 2/3 majority in the CoaAS/oc.

: (9) Seek resolution in . COAS under Resolution VIII of Punta
. del Este which would recommend:

(a) extension of arms embargo to all items of trade except
food and medicine (Fall back position: extension of
arms embargo to all strategic items);

(b) prohibition of AR ships from transporting embargoed
items and deny use of ports to ships in Bloc~Cuba trade;

(ec) denial of over-flights and transit rights to Soviet air-
raft on bloc-Cuba runs. (Points (b) and (c) could also
be added to No. (8).)

Considerations:

This is feasible and consistent with our objectives, and could
be taken independently of other steps.

With adequate consultation and preparation, near-unanimity
should be possible. Brazil would probably not go along. The actual
effect of extending the embargo so far as Latin America is concerned
is more psychological than practical because Latin American countries
ship little except food to Cuba. But it would show forward movement —
and would provide a useful argument with our allies if it included an
appeal to other Free World nations to take similar- steps. .

It vould offer a helpful (though not necessary) basis for UsS.
unilateral steps in controlling shipping, implementing 107 of the
Foreign Assistance Act, and for urging other states to control. Soviet
flights to Guba. —

(10) Intensify through COAS and. SCCS programs of recommended
controls over subversive activities. Seek COAS resolution warning .
Castro that continued subversive activity may t result in action
under Rio treaty. te : - Lats oo

Considerations:

oye

The course described in the first sentence of. (10) is being.
presently pursued. under the decision taken at Punta del Este and
should be continued. . However, it would be difficult to get unani-
mous or near unanimous support for the warning resolution because
of the reference to the Rio Treaty.

(11) Invoke Rio Treaty on basis of Castro's continued

subversive activities.

Considerations:

If we desire to institute more vigorous collective sanctions vs.
the Castro regime for its subversive activities, it would be. neces-
sary to invoke:the Rio Treaty since the present functions given the
COAS and Special Consultative Committee on Security (SCCS) under
Resolution II of Punta del Este provide authority only for surveil-
lance and recommendations to governments for control ‘measures.

i The primary threat of Castro is his subversive activities in

| the hemisphere. Should the level of Castro-directed subversive

4 activities in the Hemisphere increase appreciably, this would become
, a more feasible and desirable course. This becomes an increasing
possibility in view of Castro's recent speech inciting insurrection
in Latin America.

The basis of any such action should consist of the production
of hard evidence of the direct involvement of the Cuban regime in
subversive activities in the hemisphere. There is, however, in-
sufficient hard evidence available at this time to obtain COAS
action. (A U.S. project to collate all available evidence is under
way.) : ~~

, (12) Assign the functions and operations of the Advisory | :
Defense Committee (ADC) to the Inter-American Defense Board (TADB) .

This could be done: / :

(a) by amending the OAS Charter to assign ADC functions to
the IADB; :

. (b) by the COAS seeking the advice of the IADB; or

(c) having the OAS member governments designate their
representatives on the IADB to serve also on the ADC.

Considerations: |

As to (a), the proposed amendment would have to be referred
to the Quito Conference (whose date has not been set). Moreover,
amendment of the Charter is a difficult and tortuous process and
requires ratification by 2/3 of the member governments.

As to (b), this is a feasible course of action which the
* Coas/OC could take without specific authority. It might be diffi-
cult, however, depending on the circumstances, to persuade the
Council of the desirability of such action. ©

individual basis, but it would be necessary to convince them that
"exceptional circumstances” prevailed which would jastify this i

. action under the OAS Charter. 7 :

COORDINATOR'S RECOMMENDATION

In selecting the optimum combination of actions to take with
respect to the OAS, the political feasibility and international
complications were key factors which I have carefully considered.”

Courses of action (2) (3) (4) (9) (10) and (12) would advance
us toward our objective, would. be politically feasible, and would
involve minimum adverse international effects. We could probably
obtain a near-unanimous vote in thé OAS for these courses except :
(10) and (12). ; :

Courses (2) (5) (6) (9) (10) (11) and (12) would advance us
considerably further toward our objective, but (6) and (11) .
particularly could create a split in hemispheric unity, and would
involve adverse international effects, including akprobable acute
confrontation with the USSR. . :

I believe courses (1) (7) and (8) will not serve our best
interests at this time.

I recommend that we take immediately courses (4) and (9).

Course (4) calls for (a) a COAS/OC resolution under the Rio
Treaty which condemns Cuba for its actions which continue to
endanger the peace, deplores refusal to allow inspection, condems

- the presence of Soviet troops and recommends continued surveil-
lance and continued vigilance against subversive activities, and
(b) terminate the COAS/0C on the tiissile crisis. This would still
leave COAS with its résponsibilities under Resolutions II and VIII
of Punta del Este which provided for a Special Consultative
Committee on Security and for the COAS to study the further sus-
pension of trade. : .

Q .

Course: (9) calls for a resolution in COAS under Resolution

VIII of Punta del Este which would recommend:

(a) extension of arms embargo to all items of trade except
food and medicine (Fallback position: extension of
arms embargo to all strategic items); . .

(o) prohibition of AR ships from transporting embargoed items
and deny use of ports to ships in Bloc-Cuba trade;

“(e) denial of overflights and transit rights to Soviet air-
eraft on Bloc-CGuba runs.

(a) a call upon ‘other Free World nations to take similar .
actions.

Rationale

“The steps I recommend would: start movement forward towards our
objective, carrying the OAS with USsy without committing us to any
‘further action.

; - After these initial measures are in effect, + we should assess .
the situation and determine the feasibility of moving forward with
any of the remaining courses of action, or any new courses which
may be opened to us by events. .

I believe we should. develop our pressures steadily and gradu- .

under constant review for the optimum opportunity. .* to initiate
additional measures.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

(Prepared for the Meeting of Thursday, January 24, 1963, at 10 a.m)

FROM : Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

SUBJECT: § Cuban Brigade

PROBLEM

To determine the future of the Cuban
Brigade (participants in the Bay of
Pigs invasion recently released from
Cuban prisons), and other Cubans who
participated in or trained for the
invasion. To determine the future of
existing Cuban training programs.

DISCUSSION

Approximately 1500 Cubans participated in the Bay
of Pigs invasion (known as Brigade 2506), the great
majority of whom were captured. In December 1962 over
1100 were released. .

- A decision on the future of the Cuban Brigade and
other Cubans trained militarily by the U. Ss, must logically
proceed from whatever over all policy the U. S. adopts
toward Cuba. .

. A trained Cuban Brigade would be of relatively
marginal military value. because of its quantitative
limitations and restricted military capability, but its

.” SECRET_

HW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 112
-2-

politico-psychological value as a symbol of Cuban
. ' vesistance to Castro/Communism may more than compensate
: for its limited military utility.

Any moral responsibility to the Brigade must be
weighed. .

COURSES OF ACTION

Three courses of action appear |
feasible with respect to the
Brigade's future.

(1) Induce the Brigade to disband as a military
unit, with no further U. S. special assistance. .¢

If this policy were adopted, Brigade members and
their families would be eligible for the benefits now
accorded to all needy Cuban refugees in the Miami area
(approximately 105,000). These benefits are equivalent
to those received by American citizens in Dade County,
Florida who are in need. The principal ones include:
financial grants of up to $100 per month for a family
and up to $60 a month for an individual; hospitalization
and out-patient facilities at county and private hospitals |
for acute illnesses; distribution of surplus food commodities;
employment counseling; resettlement, including transportation
and a transition grant; foster care for unaccompanied
'ehildren; special English and refresher courses for doctors
and Lawyers at University of Miami; a student loan program
. for Cubans attending U. S. universities provides -
up to $1,000 a year; supplemental assistance to Dade
County, Florida, is provided by HEW to cover 50 percent of
cost of educating Cuban refugee children in primary |
and secondary schools; payment for a substantial part
of special language courses and vocational training; and
_ physical examinations and inoculations at time of
entry into the U. S. Sos

BOD has a program providing for enlistment in the

.s U. S. Army of those Cuban nationals between the ages of 18
and 30 who pass entrance requirements. (A similar program
for the Navy covers ages 18-26). The program provides
20-22 weeks of training at the conclusion of which they
are transferred as individuals to U. S. Reserve status.
They are not required to know English. A’two week period.

for resettlement is also provided at the termination of
the training.

Another DOD program enables former officers of the
Cuban Army, Navy and Air Force to volunteer on a highly
selective basis for programs in the U. S. Armed Forces.
Training periods are from 20 to 36 weeks. English is
necessary.. The officers are in civilian status. They
receive a salary from the Cuban Revolutionary Council and
a per diem through DOD from AID funds which are no longer
available. : ,

Considerations:

This course of action would provide the simplest and
most economical way of disposing of the problem, provide
equal treatment for all eligible Cuban refugees; equivalent
to benefits offered to American citizens. oO

Individual Cubans could continue to be accepted for
service in the U. S. Armed Forces and their language, skill
and country knowledge could be distributed through various
U. S. units which might be used in an invasion.

The unsatisfactory aspects of this course are that
it would appear to run counter to expectations of the Brigade
as a result of Administration statements and actions; it: ,
would result in substantial loss of whatever "mystique"
the Brigade possesses, which might be useful in unifying
Cuban refugees; and a phasing out of this kind would
probably engender some adverse political reaction
domestically as well as from the Brigade and its
sympathizers. Also it might have an undesirable effect
on opinion in Latin America and other parts of the
Free World concerning the determination of. the United States

-hn

to unseat the Castro regime, and would lend weight to

arguments that the U. S. may be leaning toward coexistence ©
with the Castro regime.

(2) Train the Brigade and Cubans in training as a
unit. Maintain and support them as a military reserve

component of the U. S. Armed Forces.
Considerations:

Under this course of action whater "mystique" the
Brigade possesses in the anti-Castro community could perhaps -
be exploited in the struggle for Cuban liberation, and used
to bring about greater unity in the Cuban anti-Castro exile
community.

Tt would constitute an immediate political and
psychological advantage by demonstrating to the Cubans
within Cuba, to the Cuban exile community, and to Latin
Anericans, the-U. S. determination to establish a
striking force symbolic of U. S. intent to overthrow the
present Cuban regime.

It would satisfy one of the principal desires expressed’
by top Brigade leaders and would promote prestige and esprit
among its members. It would appear to be in consonance with
the statements and actions of the Administration in
connection with the future of the Brigade.

But it would inevitably. become a focal point for
Cuban exile political activities in the Miami area, and
morale, discipline and esprit would be difficult to
maintain over the long term without early employment to
retake Cuba. It could generate domestic political and
military criticism by incorporating organized alien groups
in the U. S. armed forces reserve: component. There is a

risk that an impulsive, irrational act by Brigade members,
as members of the U. 8S. reserve forces, could be a source of
serious embarrassment to the U.S .

(3) Tailor a special civilian and military program

for Brigade members. Encourage the Brigade to continue
as_a ''fraternal" unit similar to the "Flying Tigers".
Encourage those Brigade members who enter the current

military training program for Cubans to establish a
Brigade military reserve component which other U. S.
militarily-trained Cubans could join. .

Under existing authority, HEW could provide the y
following additional benefits for Brigade members in
need, over and above those now offered: special employ-
ment counseling and placement service; extended student
loans to provide for all institutional costs such as
tuition, books, etc., even if this exceeds $1,000 per
year (living costs to be provided by another agency);
expanded vocational training in the Miami area; increased
financial assistance to needy persons while in training;
increased distribution of surplus food (with approval
of the Department of Agriculture).

The following additional programs could be under-
taken by HEW upon Presidential determination that such
action would contribute to the defense and security
of the United States or advance its foreign policy
interests: scholarship grants for students; loans for
vocational training anywhere in the United States; an

. expanded training program similar to a G. I. Bill of
Rights, in the United States and/or abroad. The cost
of these additional programs, assuming an expenditure
of $2,500 per person per year would be about $2.5 million.

Establishment of additional programs, after a

‘privileges for Brigade members. .

COORDINATORS 'S RECOMMENDATION

1. I recommend course (3), a specially tailored
program for Brigade members.

2. I recommend against a Presidential determination
providing broader privileges for Brigade members.

3. I recommend no change in existing U. S. military
training programs for Cubans, except that a Brigade reserve
unit should be authorized and other Cuban reservists should
be permitted to join.

4. I recommend that the Brigade be induced rather than
forced to accept this proposal, and intend. to arrange ~
consultation with them immediately if this course of
action is approved.

Rationale

Lacking an immediate military use for the Brigade we
should disband the Brigade as such. Since we may in the
‘future desire the presence in the U..S.. Armed Forces of
militarily-trained Cubans, we should encourage Brigade.
members to enlist. in the existing military training
program for. Cubans and to enter. a U..8.: Reserve Unit
‘thereafter.

Our programs should be designed to encourage
the Brigade members to melt back into the exile
community and engage in constructive pursuits
pending the liberation of Cuba. We should offer
them some special assistance but not to the extent
that they become a perpetual privileged class
within the community, Presidential action on their
behalf would single them out unnecessarily.

SOURCE: —, A qualified, astute observer (8) who has contacts in the
'  ° [talian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Appraisal of
_Content: 2, that the document is genuine.

The following is a translation of a report dated
6 December 1962 sent by the Italian Embassy in,
“Habana to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

In my dispatch of 9 November I reported on some of the-
| . . considerations. regarding the consequences which the recent
I _* > erisis could have on the international position of Cuba. I
“will now add some comments on the ‘conjecture which has been

reported by some members of our representations. :

1) The possibility that there will-soon be a lwosening of

:.. the political and economic ties with the USSR appears to me
..t0 be nil at this time. The fact that the talks with Mikoyan
. were lTong-and-difficuit and that Castro expressed in private
-his opinion on Khrushchev (wishing that Stalin were still

: _ alive) does not mean that he can and will renounce ‘th iat 4,

' Soviet assistance which is vital to him.” This assistance

cannot be replaced by the Chinese.

~ Certainly the Chinese Ambassador to Habana will have
done everything possible to convince Castro to resist (and
jn fact the latter held firm on the question of inspection).
‘Certainly the activity of the Chinese representation here is
intense. But the Peiping Government cannot replace the USSR
-in economic assistance. It does not seem probable to me
that /China7 can furnish more than it has furnished to date,
which consists of second quality foodstuffs, rather shoddy :

“wool and silk material, and many trifles of which the stores

in Habana are full. AS for machinery and spare parts, /China7

-Ls not in a position to compeke with that merchandise supplied

by the USSR, CzechoSlovakia, Hungary, and Poland. \

In substance Castro, even if he cannot exactly be defined
aS pro-Khrushchev, is tied to the USSR in. such a way that he
cannot for any reason release himself. I recall in this”
regard that on 2 November, after the visit of U Thant during
the most acute moment of the crisis in Cuban-Soviet relations,
he declared, "We are above all Marxist-Leninists and friends
of the USSR. There will be no breaches in our relations.

Given this, I feel that the statements of the vice director ©

of TASS as reported by the Embassy in Helsinki are a ‘good
resume of the Situation, i.e., a) Soviet leaders have for

some time felt perplexed with regard to Castro's character

and person because he is reluctant to be "guided" docilely by ©
Moscow. b) The USSR will continue to give all its economic
support to Cuba because otherwise its prestige would suffer a
grave , blow particularly ain Latin America.

. 2) Aliso excluded, it appéars to me, is the possibility that
the revo tis Lonary regime of Castro can be changed into.a

Piles)

Titoisi"” regime. It is comprehensible that, as Ambassador
Zoppi reported, some "non-aligned" countries and even some
Latin American countries desire’such a change and ‘are doing
everything possible to proveke it. It is also possible that

“ gome Cubans Share these sentiments. But, in my opinion, it

is impoSsible that such a change can take place while Castro -
is in power. As I pointed out in my previous report, it is
not in Castro's temperament to become "non-aligned", to
imitate anyone, and even less to’ take Tito as a model.
Mherefore Castro would have to be eliminated, and this
possibility seems very remote.

3) As I noted in my 9 November report it is difficult for
Castro to remain calm. Therefore the revolutionary regime
will continue with all means at its disposition to disseminate ©

‘subversive propaganda in the whole continent, as demonstrated
-by the fact that all the states of Latin America (ine luding

Mexico} are taking strong measures against the dissemination
of this propaganda. But it is doubtful that today Castro can
do much more and that he constitutes a real menace to the

Securtty of other countries, if only because he lacks the.

necessary funds. I tend to. share tHe opinion of the
Ambassador -to Brazil that the Cuban leaders are trying to

concentrate all their subversive efforts in one country, and

that they have selected Venezuela for various reasons, includ-
ing the old ill feeling between Castro and Betancourt. I note
in passing that, according to what was told me by the afore-

mentioned Ambassador, during the recent meeting of the OAS the

'. Venezuelan representative accused the Cubans of promoting the’

recent attempts in his country but, when asked to furnish
proof, he was unable to do so. a

It would certainly be highly desirable if a serious
pressure action on Cuba could be exercised within a purely
Latin American framework as pointed out by our Embassy in

Buenos Aires. But it is an extremely remote possibility. The.
countries which could do it do not have the necessary material |
means. A partial solution would worsen the situation and a
definitive solution could be directed only by Washington. 1°
_, think therefore that only pressure which is accompanied by’.
“material strength can obtain results in Cuba. : ; ”

tn conclusion, in judging the Cuban situation it is ° Con,
necessary first to keep in mind the personality and temperament |.
of Fidel Castro, the influence which he has on a part of the..
- population, and finally his deep-rooted hate of the United :
. States. -It is useless to Say that the Cuban revolutionary
‘regime, purged of some fanaticism, could be a good example
‘for other Latin American countries, This would not take into
account the mentality of the Cuban leaders and particularly
‘their. chief, who accepts council from no ane and intends to
imitate no one. Furthermore it is too late to select another.
. path. As Guevara said the other day in an interview for the :
‘Daily Worker, "this is a battle to the death with the United.
. States in which the most. possible damage must be done to the .:
. adversary." ; 2 a!

Undoubtedly, after the events of October and November, .
‘Fidel Castro is in a descending parabola. But how long this. *
. Gescent will last no one can Say today, The only certain ee
- thing is that the economic Situation is getting worse every.
.. day and therefore the revolutionury regime needs the
» “assistance of the whole Communist world. Only last night .-‘
‘a commercial mission headed by Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, who-. 7): .
“heads ‘the most important institution of the country ~ the 37)
‘Institute for Agrarian Reform ~ left. The mission will goo.
‘first to Moscow and then to Peiping. It is evident that a
. -héew agreements must be negotiated, as well as new credits, 20.
