The rocting with br. Miro on October 16 wa poatruned from 10100
until suck tine as bia nutience ten inated with Cuntinal Srellran. He
artived at my poor at abut J0150. He declared that the Cardinal had

hania of Castros ceclured that the Architahop of Mianl wantlt doing
enouvh for the Cubnn retyyjeess thit the U.Se wasn't doing enough for
thems that Custro cust be overthrown, Piro toh: the Cardinal that in
all Latin Arerica there vere goin: to be orsarired acts of ayrpathy
for the Cutan sufferers, The Cardinal said he would say 4 Mase for
thes cn October 17, He invited Hiro to see hin at any thre.

Miro anawored ry query as to the Lacenia utCrirs by stating that

“$e wag vary successfuls 2,%CO poonle were inaive the auditorium and

another 1,000 peole outuides that Lacerda had recotved such appluuse.

The inter-Arerican Press Association affatrs also had given an
opportunity to present the Cuban tragedy. He nal! that be (Firo) had
tol? how Fidel had alot 31 peonle in Septex.ber alone, am! other vetalley

“had described how Ccemunisr: vas gaining groun! day by days that in

nots that everybody 1s confused.

Be inCorned ro that as for the dociments relating to the Cuban
plots in Argontina, the Arpontine rilitary ren care to talk to Varons,
and he gave then ecne‘doourents that have no imvortance. The officers
told Verona textually "se heve no confidence in the Argentine Foreiga

docurenta to the Foreirn Office, Put these documents had no inortances
they were ccrely to ueronstrate tha’ there hac teen an extradition of

Miro eaid they also visunlized another uct involving Lacerda in
Miani, Dut that bis “adr inistrative” budget really does net “rovids for

that 1¢ was believed that measures are recessary to forrent in Cuba.

"How ubout arta for the Bscartrey?® ssked Miro. I replied that
it wan rz understanding that urms for *ze Escar.brey could only te

I interposed that there seered some question about the pauper frow

"I've asked for roney for the clandestine groups. hat have they aaid
about that?" Firo asked, I reslied that there is a problem of the reans of
delivery, that the Italian & bassy at present appeers undesirable. The
Ambassador ian't thero, well, ve look for another reans; the Argentine -
anything - those peonle need : onsy" he countered. I have to carry out con=
crete things,” he declared. *I'r now like 6 person’ in a swirring pool
without water." "For three emi a half ronths I've struggled to maintain a
revolutionary spirit. My rilitsry veople are waiting till I urrived and
tell then, "thia .ust be done, that must be done. Sothing yet! and without
any clan, I don't go unywhere; nowhere!

"The other time I went with sy eyes closed, through faith, Ke hed a
fallure and the failure fell upon-res—T cannot proceed under such circur-
atances in no way. I've asked for-$50,000 to send in to the unjerground.
The Russians are spending $40C,CO0 in propaganda and have leas than the
U.S. ¥e srall not compromise the U.S. Tell ne the way to vend it in, The

_ Council is to aid them, not merely to conduct neatings.4

*0On that request they bsven't renlied anytting?" he asked, I sneered
that on this iter, I had made known Miro's desire, but that so far nothing

had been resolved,

"I'm not corplaining," he stated, "but for three rontha I have been
asking fcr a con.ict withthe authority to resolve. Why? Because I'm
getting nowhere, when I return now I ehall be asked, "Kow sbout 4t?" and
must anawer, 'You will have to walt becauge I have ncthing.! And meanwhile
the Agency keeps on infiltrating people into Cuba incerendent of the.
Consejo. Let us go back. Without being in agrserent, I cannot serve you.
I have no interest in presiding over a Council that is of no uge."

T pointed out that the Council rust continue to exist, with him as
its president, aa the coordinating body uf the resistance roverent, but
that there are certain difficulties in putting the student or labor activie
ties under the direction cf the Council; that these groupa are now functioning
efficiently and that I trusted that he could see the croblers of completely
changing their control, direction, and coordination. I added that I
believed that he should know sonething of what they are doing and that I
believed that should be kept inforced,

"I know absolutely nothing,” he revlied. "what cores to me is from
these same individuals, I au not in agreenent with that, I's becoring ridie
culous. Under these ¢!rcumstances I cannot contimus, I have nlanted the
probler: of tho underground, the probler of the collateral organizations
(thet he vould like tc have in Council by teing their source of support
and coordination), of the ragistrates, and now you have seon chet ALABAU has
done (sreclaiming GARCEFAN as president of exile goverment), tho is worke
ing with you people, and you have seen the reaction cf ths State Departrent.
How yosterdsay ALABAU is publishing political denunciations against the
Council. I have discussed the ratter of the :agistrates with the C.1.A., I
don't remenber the naxe of the person. A month kas psesed and the other
Bagistrates (those with ALABAU) haven't been stovped (in their activities)

"If we don't rake crevazenda and send arra into Cute now, it's useless,"
he declared. “And I canst rerein in ellenco,” I renlicd that I telieved

He reiterated that noviing had been resolved cn any of bis requests and
procesals, am that he eculia't ecntinue thus, That he could quit, go to. -
Puerto Kico as a profasscr. Re eddcd te would want te vorx with us. Ho then

(CRC), Ihave seven, to wrk with you, with ne, vith the people who are

going to carry out the activities, with the people that I designate.
Nothing of that is being done. Then what they want is to work alone.”

. "I will not continue. I will not continue from the:tine I return to
Miami, I have gone on for five ronthe, struggling. I cannot accept this
situation, I have tried to pull together those sroupa 4s )asked in the
White House. I haven't succeeded in Grouning any rore, because ~ I want to
speak clearly in order to rerain good friends alvays = Leontsze you huve
prevented tt. The etucenta haven't joined, not because of no political
reason, but rerely tecauss you suport ther: directly. Presumably the idea
ia that in thie vay the seourlty of this nation 1s better saferuarted.

A Consejo was desired to serve aa the Coordinnting group and to provide a
feans by which the United States vould not appear toto intervening in Cuba.
Ir there ia to be a Consejo, it must have all the dignity of a Council.

“When I try to form a Council, grouping all elexents together, they
don't join because they are talkin, directly with your people ~ and there
is an office for that rurpose in Fiami ~ which deals with all the ren vho
want to work, tho vant to do things. This is all indecendent of tho Council.
And some vork for a destruction of the Council, I cannot tolerate this. I
have a gon vho 1s a vrisoner; either I know the plana, and I knew the saneuver
and tho problems that they are going to carry out, or I, when I arrive in
Miani, will say, "Xo," and send woud to Washington, Let them cdo without me.
There will be semeone who will submit to these things, but not 1."

®and of the four iters that prorised me to resolve, there
have not been resolved any, and I find pyself in the dark, And I as. very
sorry. Iam not going to corvrevise the security of this Nation, but
neither un I going to conprorise the situation of these boya. When they
disappeared, lost their lives, atc,, I waa contronted with "And you are the
preeidont of the Council.” I carnot remaine in this Way eo®

"I haven't been able to group together anything. I Mas vrowised that
the zagistrates vould all incorrorate together (into the Council), but
that rascal ALALAU 1s working against the Couneil and I have reason to
believe that he 4s doing it with Agency aupport, otherwise how would he pay
for his polities] denunciations." I resoonced, that [ believed this could
not be true, He akcuted, "I kave expressed my position te you, and I want
you to get an ansver when you can. If thesa vrotlera that I have set forth
do not have an irmediate aclution, I & not‘to kuew and to dispose of
relative actions to be taken, then how, in view of ry situation, must I do.*

He asked about the olan for clandestine sabotaze action by commando
raid, that he had given us, ani what had core of it. I replied that he rust
realize that the study of such a vlen necessarily was slow ond must be

” considered by rany. He said he was convinced that there vas no intention of

accepting such plans, ard that while now we discues such plans, we lose out.
“I cannot accept this situation, nor would you.* , .

Who fa nothing.

T repinded him that I had my talke with hin only ton daya tefore, not
twenty, and that I could talk to no one in Wauhington until a week ago and
had to have rany ecnversations with rany people, and that his proposals
Could not be rosolved In auch a short tire, He returned ta the a;tecront
thet "plana of action be discussed jointly; that i there vere objections,
that the objoctiona be discussed. He said thero had been no objections so
fer to discuss; nor objections to propaganda plans, He vas to have contact

tions that want to collaborate, and with Dr. Viro — nothing developed on
thet He declared that he should have knowledge of the activities of

tecaune they want to cuin the power for therselves; to act on their om
aconunt, He said he knows there 1a o "Jin® and a "Robert" and others that

ore doing things,

T assured bir he cust realize that there ware sany problens involved
in his proposals and that tire was essential to work then out, I rerinded
hiv of bla conversation with Mr. Goodwin and the lattera’ state: ent to the
effect that therm could be no thought in the foreseeuble future of a mille
tary operution against or invasion of Cuba, Miro countered by referring tw
hie oonverastion with the President on 16 July and his (Miro's) corplaint
of inactivity, He sald the President pronosed the recruiting of Cubans in
different units of tho arry for training so aa to utilize ther at the
opportune tine, and that the officers would be invited to our pilitery
schools, Miro said he had gathered soce of the military topether ard ine
forzed them of this offer, and tho next voex he was: culled to discuss the

‘recruiting, wi:ich he a-proved, Then Genera} Herahey went to sea in at

hia house, telling hiz thet Cubans wouldn't be sent, to Berlin or any suoh
Place but kept in the U.3, uvailuble for use later, Piro said, “It there

Hw commented that he was going to ask that his photo;raph vot be put on

. the cover of a certain zagasino because he didn’t know vhothor ho was

going to continue; that in the present cire:zestances he didn't see how Le

eould continue, Again I urged that Le rust do 80, ard that I felt certain -

that ve could reoolve aure of his provosals, crobubly not to the extent
that he desired, but at least in purt, tut that tine was necessary to.

accotplish this. ,

He repeated that the Council needs to have scare sotion'aken in Cuda,
tut the Agency keens on uncertaking actiora withoul any connection with
the Council. Further, that he rust have tho raann for ecnductiong prope
yanda, such ns outlined in the "Operaticn Griota.” He askod,so when could

of State, with Kr. Goodwin, with representatives of the Agency, and that I
hopod thut surething would te resolved, tut thet he must realize that rany

Won I questioned whethor tha Fonteoristi orvanizaticn wac util] in
the ChC, he said it. was, that only Justo Carillo had dropped cut of the
CHE but the group rerained in and had a nov head. He added that he had
just had a requost from Carillo to provide hin (Carille) with a thousand
dollars; that Carillo had photographic copies of some checks that he had
paid,to Waldo Frank for propaganda activities azainst Cuba and that
Carillowad asking roimbureerent but Miro said he didn't consider he had
to give it to Carille. |

Returning to the budgot, Miro Said, "There are ‘the verlois erployoeas
there is the item of trips; there are the military jeople grouped uncer
the military comminaion ~ I cannot let the. suffer nisery. There ore no
atudenta on the payroll beceuse they are being suodrtad by you (the

out intending to, and for reavona of insecurity, ard going to destroy
the Council." He then stated that ho had placed Alvares Dias, who had
been Kinioter of Finance, in charge of finance mattera because he (Mire)
could not be everywhere, andto make certain that no exrensea were paid
on which they were not in agreeront, and which Paule would carry out.

t

3 querried whether Paula would cortinue as accountant, and Miro said,
"certainly, 4a accountant." He said that everyone has been coring to him
(Mire) with all kirds of pleas for money and therefore it was necessary
to have Alvarez Diaz in hore so that he and Paula night resolve the finance
matrera. Miro added words of praise for Paulu, "It's like I want to have
for each section of the Council, like I vanted Conte! Aguero to handle
propaganda, but since he is receiving roney fron you, (the agency) he
doesn't want to, I have to have soreone to take this load off of re; first
ag in Naval affairs, eazeone to lock for boats, arta, ete.”

I asked atout Festre for proparanda and Miro replied that Festre is
no good, never wis of value; that he had teen put ini charze of the proca~
ganda cormission previously and given $48,000 ronthly, but had done nothings

that Svan te stoy:ad but, since they work directly, these people ore
vefenied. He added wryly that he wished ‘they (the Agerey) would defend
him (Fire) that way. :

He said thoy (the Aseney) had posed the crobler five zonths age in
Fiori relative to Joaquin, Jagerio, a Cuban who wea working with the
Councs2 and has worked regrificently, but ten he uecepted work with the
€.1.A, and continues doing thie (ard doa vhatever he slesien) — intele
iivencay ara, recr.iting, atc, -~ and villi have nothing to do with the
Councils - :

Again Miro declared thut he had the hivhest regard for Paulo and
couldn't desnonue vith: hir; had ‘even propowd his nare to Le the lagtatrate
of the Tribunal of Aceounta inthe futuro poverrzent of Cuba. I added
ny understardiny that Prslo had dono an excellent Job, oarticulerly
sentioniny his bandling of paying cerender.ta, a meticulous and arduous
task, Hiro exciained that he had never ecnsicercd replacing Paula but
merely needed Alvares fiaz to handle details with Pavla. He antd every~
cn@ in Mest joows it is Puila vho has the moray to cake paynents by
check, an? that he thought 3% would be ketter for the people to get pay=
rents Jn cash ani sign a receiot; that soretines sucacse right rob Paula
and then people will suk “fro: where docs this xoney ecrs,* aince the
Cubuno have no roney,” :

Then Dr. Miro said he would like to clarify any doubtf.l questiona, I
asked whether he hind received an; other communication fecx the Eacambray
group, He revlied thet io had rot, but that the ona had cora through the
Kontecristi vroun ani thay continued toaek hi: for this arrs ald. I
asked whether any chanyis or additions had been rade in the Counci] at the
October 10th neeting. He replied that the MRP had not answered hie ine
vitation bucause they wore working with the Azency, and that the new
group, the Union Kevoluctonario, had replied that they did not, because
they have a delegste in vashington who 1s seeking direct contact with
U.S. Goverrsent Agercies, . 7

Miro then declared that in order to call a Council reeting, he had to
have a preas cunfarerce or a press rolense (about, calling a CRC rwoting)
but Prio, ALARA, and everybody wero rpainat all ti ia, and were doubtful

Dr. Miro continued to cwell on }:i9 concern as to the future if these
young fighters are given a free hand to co as they plesse; that care must
be taken as to who ip sunported, that these people are the onea who don't
want to work with us; thet the fk? hopes that 1t will be the ore who will

Dr, Miro corrented in further detail his views and again ha tered on
the ranner of uring funds to avoid being like the ostrich. "iveryone

I told tr. Fipo that I wa anxious to werk cut sore ranner of ling irg
these groups vith ir. Miro anid the Council, without having to channel
direction and funce through Dr. Miro, since these groups are now function=
ing well uncer «xisting arrangerents.

Dr. Mire #-1d he would te rleased to meet with ther. outside of the
Couneil, and they ray continue to function as c-llateral or,anizations
independently; tut tet they realize that they tave one: direction. Or.
Yiro ad'ed tret lixe the Independent magistrates vith their attitude
they are injuricy the Council.

Dr. Miro c-atented that he winted the raziatrates to have on election
and select their leacer according to the resuits of a vote. He reiterated
that all the eclleteral organisations runt ozerate within the orbit uf tze.
Councils and that be would be glad to discusa with ther their opinions
just as he es & professor had done with stuterts--cften tines resulting
in excellent iteaa end viewpoints,

Then I rautioned that I had read in one of our magazines 4 laucatcry
item describirg nis cexonatrated capabilities as a redlator botween
political grows end individuals. ~

Dr. Miro egain returned to his belief tiut Cundis of all organizatiors
should furnei through the Council because every Cuban haz a sense of seell
that inclanes bis to go where he knova the money is dispensed; that this is
sad but trues end that those who are still outside and hope to get direct
support, /sthey mew that the noney was here (in rte hands), would core
running without urging. He then said that he had seven hundred collars,
more or less, for each organization's operating sxpenses. He concluded
by asying that te dida't wish to operate without us (Agency) or without
any of the Avency cmonle, but merely desired to pull tegether the diverse
groups and otter activities, ‘

He then rs Zerred to his conversations with Mr. Berle and Seneral
Taylor, and ris view expressed to then that in the April affair he felt
that the Agerey t2¢ functioned wore or leas effectively — soretires
their peovle kad Leen "rough", or "tough", but that he bad no corplaint;
that tho lack of efr cover no doubt caused defeat. khen he had been
querried by recerters and other on specific Guesticns designed to pry
eecreta out of riz, te had replied, "I didn't see ther," or oiziliar
evaaions, and thus hed ondeavcred to be loyal to ua. :

He said his son had heen certain that hig father vould be with the
emediticnary force, and, in route to the Bay of Pigs from Guaterala
the gon bad searched for hir. on he boats, and was distllusaioned because
his father wasn't there. :

Again he ercphasised his view that the stuconts sent to Latin Arerican
countries on rropaganda rlesions should be indoctrinated by veople in the
Council to prepare them for the cross exining that they vould undergo,
and thereby prepare thes against trans and foolish statortnts; and to
insure that no Batista suoporters vere sent out. He erphazised that one
of the first questions asked of these propaganda orissaries would be
*hith what roney do you come here?" “shat Yankeo organization is behind
you.® He added, "The peorle have to be will prevared. to answers just ag
TZ bad to undergo a succession of penetrating questions when T first vent
into exile in Argentine and could ansver ther without hesitation because
of a clean record, .

Again he care back to his urgurent that the collatoral organisations
should function through the Council = nok "forgetting the Agency, tut not
being forjottan by the Agency." I told Pr. Miro that I hoped during the
course of the week to have a nerlos of conversations inthe course of
Which certain decisions and colutions would te reached thet vould enable
me te sit dow with him the following seek and work out sore details on
propaganda and other ratters.

Sr, Mire then asked, "How best canthe sceurity of this nation be
insured = the Agency dealing directly with those neonle or working with
the: through Firo7* Aud he errhasized that he sag concerned toth with
the security of Cuba and of the United States, and that these people
{Cubans with whor the Ayency is dealing <irectly) at any monent vhen
they Zelt they were losing out or vere not sufficiently paid = would
ask for rores ani, being Cutans, right ba very indiserete; but that if
they had to deal with Miro they gould be obligated to go to hig with
their corplaints., He sald that Just as a bee seeking aweots will go to
any source, but if there is cnly cne source it vill go to that ones and
that thus all grows .ust look to the Council, '

again Dr. Miro returned to his thesis thet sooner’ or later there rust
be war to overthrow Custro, and that Cutans and Aroricans pust realize
this; that as 4 preliminary the Cubsna must carry out sabotage, atc.,
but just 4a blockades didn't overthrow Franca or Musgolini, reither would
they cause the fall of Castros further that if suborage was comlucted with«
out being a part of on vvera:l plan of rissions, the people inside Cuba
Would come to react adversely to the subotace and align therselves with

Castro.
Re then excressed his view that time is being sadly wasted in trying

to bring the Latin arerieen countries into agreerent with the U.S. against
Castro, because, unfortunately, cary are ruled by dictators and they fear

‘Concerted action against therselves, but if the U.S, attackn and destroys

Castro they vill avplaud. drain he repeated thst the Punta del Este
agreerent night well cause rany countries to say, "Thank you Fidel, and

not, thank you Vr. Kennedy.”

Dr. Miro emphasized that he vanted to collaborate vith ue fully, Then
the conversation turned to the dissolution of the FRD by Varona, and Dr.
Miro declared that this steo ves difficult or-Varona, to take because he
