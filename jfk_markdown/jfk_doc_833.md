The US consul in Antwerp has been informed by the Varmi
Company of Brussels that it will not sell construction
equipment to Cuba; there have been reports that such a
sale, perhaps totaling $1 million, was being negotiated.
Meanwhile, a Cuban group, which had probably planned to
complete negotiations on the sale, was delayed because
of lack of visas. (Page 6)

The US Embassy in Tokyo sees little hope of inducing the

Japanese Government to interfere with the implementation

of a contract under which Japanese private firms have re-
portedly agreed to purchase 325,000 tons of Cuban sugar.

‘MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS:

An intercepted Cuban military message,of 5 December
lindicated that the Cuban armed forces are“ kiving instruction
‘in defense against chemical warfare. An-Uunidentified)mili-
tary unit in (La Villas) Province reported the selection of
_two officers and four sergeants to atterid a "chemical defense
jcourse." (USN-856, 2X/SLACUMYT407-63, 6 December, SECRET SABRE)

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: ay 99

Moscow has given rather standard treatment to the OAS
‘meeting which heard the Venezuelan Government charge Castro
with illegal arms shipments. On 4 December, TASS correspond-
ent.. Leonid Shokin reported that "the weavers of plots against
revolutionary Cuba are still at it...accusing it of delivery
of arms to Venezuela for ‘subversive purposes’, "  Shokin found
"eertain US circles are the most interestec’in this, as is
‘evident from the fact that representatives of the US State
‘Department declared at the meeting that the United States
‘would 'firmly support' additional economic and diplomatic
;sanctions by the OAS against Cuba." He thought it unexcep-
|tional that "these provocative attempts were not supported by
‘the largest Latin American countries" and: warned that "such
‘attempts to interfere in Cuban internal affairs are fraught.
iwith extremely harmful consequences for the cause of peace."
_(CIA/¥BIS, Moscow, 4 December, UNCLASSIFIED)

‘CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:

Several weeks ago there were CAS reports that the storn-
‘tossed peasants of Oriente looked on Hurricane Flora as the
\vengeance of God-<a God, who in the tradition of the Old
‘Testament's stern and sometimes vengeful Jehovah, had loosed
his fury on a people first seduced and now impressed by an
‘alien regime. Now a report from the US Naval Base at Guan-
itanamo Bay provides yet another insight into the frame of mind
|of the Cuban populace. While the incidents pictured in this
‘report do not necessarily reflect anything other than a com-
‘bination of religious fervor and superstition, they are signifi-
‘cant to the extent that they reflect the unrest--and, perhaps
la growing feeling of hopelessness and despair--current among
,the Cubans.

In any case, there are prevalent lecally tales of St.
Barbara! S appearing several times to prophesy a change in the
‘regime or admonish errant youths to mend their ways. /Barbara,
‘virgin daughter of the heathen Diosorus, was beheaded by her
,father near Heliopolis in 235 A.D. for embracing Christianity.
.A fearful thunderclap is alleged to have greeted her execution.
| Symbolized by a windmill-like tower with three windows, the
|type 6f fortress in which her father was wont to confine her
‘while he was absent from home, Barbara is the patroness of
‘artillerymen and miners.

/In the Church's calendar, her feast is marked on 4 Decem-
ber.” Apart from her significance in the Christian ritual,
Barbara figures prominently in a neo-pagan cult known as
the Santeria.. Devotees of Santeria regard themselves as
Catholics and believe that the names of the Catholic saints
are translations into Spanish of the Nigerian names of African
gods. Catholicism is viewed as the Spanish tribal version of
Santeria. The association between Catholicism and Santeria
is based on a largely superficial similarity between Catholic
saints and the pantheon of African spirit gods. Saint Barbara
is thought to be Shango, the God of War.7

According to one of these tales, a woman dressed in

-martyr's red stopped a bus outside Guantanamo City on 25 No-

vember, stepped inside and berated the Castro regime. The

. woman is alleged to have said that the Cuban people could

not live forever in such misery and to have predicted that
Castro would be taken from them sometime between 4 and 7 De-
cember. A militiaman passenger told her that she would be
arrested when the bus arrived in the city. When it had, she'd
disappeared. Continuing on to Caimanera, the bus stopped in
the town square with the same woman sitting on one of the
seats inside the vehicle. The militia again was summoned
and again the woman was nowhere to be seen.

On 26 November the same woman allegedly appeared outside
a school in Caimanera and admonished several children not to
thrown stones at'a nearby shack, The children fled into the
school and the woman followed. Challenged by a teacher, the .
woman said she was Santa Barbara and vanished. The next day
neither the teacher nor the children would return to the
school, though it subsequently has been reopened. (COMNAVBASE

Fidel Castro was "frightened, if not terrified," by the

on 27 November, the (Portugtese diplomat) escribed what he called

"a large movement of troops" late on the Afternoon of the Presi-
dent's death--"“they were sent to take up positions around

Havana and the northern coast of the island." He found it sur-
prising that Castro "jumped into the arena to denounce insinu-
ations. which were merely from news and nongovernmental agencies,

but added that "it is the general opinion in.(diplomatice circles 2y
that the assassination will be the spring whith will unleash
passions and violent and blind hysteria of the American people
against Cuba and Russia and provide the excuse which up to now

was lacking.... There is talk again about the coincidence of

rumors concerning a crisis at the end of the year...." Finally,

during his visit to the Soviet Union. (The New York Times,

CUBAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT :

Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, minister of INRA, has expressed
serious dissatisfaction with Cuba's current agricultural situa-
tion and revealed that he disagrees with Castro's emphasis on
"ultimate aims" in place of current "tactics." In a long talk
with the British ambassador in early November, Rodriguez agreed
"with surprising enthusiasm" that the two main problems facing
Cuban agriculture were the lack of competent personnel to run
the appropriated farms, and the lack of consumer goods which
are necessary to stimulate production, especially by the remain--
ing private farmers. Rodriguez had advised Castro that there
were not sufficient agricultural experts to run the state farms
which had been previously organized, and he had counseled against
taking over medium-size farms (as the Second Agrarian Reform Law
did) until sufficiently trained and experienced personnel were

-available; he commented on Soviet complaints about the low edu-

cational level of Cubans sent to the USSR for agricultural
training. Rodriguez said that despite his advice, Castro had
gone ahead with the Second Agrarian Reform Law for two "polit-
ical" reasons: to push ahead with the progress of Cuba's

Socialist economy, and to destroy the support for counterrevo-

lutionaries which Castro believed existed among the "rural |
bourgeois." Rodriguez thought it ironical that US pressure on
Cuba (presumably he meant aid to counterrevolutionaries) had
forced Cuba to seize lands faster than it would otherwise have
done. He also stated his belief that the seizure of mediun-
size farms would lead to a drop for several years in many
branches of Cuban agriculture, particularly in market gardening
and dairy farming.

Rodriguez also agreed with the British ambassador that the
second problem facing Cuban agriculture was the lack of consumer
goods which were necessary to stimulate production. However,
Rodriguez said that Cuba was in a vicious circle: farmers did
not have incentive to produce because there were few consumer
goods available, yet such goods could not be obtained until
farm production had been raised. Rodriguez' main concern
seemed to be the scarcity of many consumer goods; in fact, he
admitted that he was willing to undertake temporary expediencies
which might help raise production, even though they might be
"doctrinally unwelcome." . Rodriguez referred the ambassador to
Lenin's New Economic Policy, and made noiattempt to disguise his
disagreement with Castro's insistence on "ultimate aims" instead
of current "tactics." (British Embassy Havana, 13 November,
CONFIDENTIAL NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

Cuba is taking further steps to improve its fishing industry.
A Havana radiobroadcast reported the completion of several con-
struction projects in the Chuyima shipyards in the Almendares
River in Havana, including a pier 307 meters in length, a concrete
esplanade measuring 17,000 square meters with a capacity of 24
ships, two launching ramps, and the dredging of the Almendares
River in front of the pier, pending partial completion, as well
as several minor jobs. It also reported that the shipyard has
launched 18 Lambda-75-class ships; 14 more are expected to be
launched by January.2 According to a:29 November intercepted

SHIPPING SUPPORT FOR CUBA:

The: US Embassy in Beirut believes’ that Lebanon may act

. to curtail the use of its ships in the Cuban trade. This would

result in a significant decline in Cuban shipping in free world

‘bottoms because Lebanese companies provided ten of the thirty-

two free world ships which called at Cuba in October. The
Lebanese foreign minister planned to ask the cabinet for a pro-
visional measure whereby he. would be able to demand that all
ships carrying Lebanese flag must call at Lebanon periodically
and report their destinations. He believed this would cut

the Cuban traffic ‘quickly by 60 percent. Because US aid to
Lebanon is almost nonexistent, the US Embassy believes that

‘this Lebanese action would. be ’ prompted by motives of princi-

ple rather. than fear of losing US aid, an action which is being
discussed by the US Congress. (Am Emb Beirut 520, 5 December,

’ CUBAN - CHINESE COMMUNIST RELATIONS:

A Havana Prensa Latina broadcast of 6 December announced

_ that President Dorticos has assented to the appointment of Wang

Yu-ping as Chinese Communist ambassador to Cuba. This is the
first information indicating that Ambassador Shen Chien, who
has served in Cuba since December 1960, is about to. be replaced.
The new Chinese Communist ambassador is a 53-year-old senior
diplomat; since 1950 he has served three- to four-year terms as
Communist ambassador in Rumania, Norway, and Cambodia. He is
married and has two children.

While he is, of course, a member of the Chinese Communist
party, he is not a ranking party member. He appears to be
a lower ranking person than newly assigned Chinese Communist
ambassadors to such countries as the UAR and Algeria. The
earliest biographic references to him have him as a member of
the Chinese Communist Army in 1931. He subsequently became
an, army political commissar and rose to the rank of general.
It. is not unusual, however, for Chinese Communist diplomats
to be generals. He speaks Russian, but there is no informa-
tion that he speaks Spanish. For the last year and a half,
however, he has been stationed in Peiping and he could have
learned the language then. He accompanied Chinese Communist
chief of state Liu Shoa-chi on the latter's visit to Cambodia
last spring. (CIA FBIS Havana, 6 December, OFFICIAL USE ONLY;

BLOC ECONOMIC RELATIONS:

L.P. Kyuchukov, chief of the Engineering Directorate of
the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Trade, was to arrive in
Prague from Havana yesterday and fly on "to Sofia today.
Kyuchukov, who is thought to have negotiated Bulgarian arms
shipments to Cuba, was noted traveling between Havana and
Santiago de Cuba. on 21 and 23 November--the third time he has

BLOC RELATIONS:

A 4-man Soviet delegation, headed by USSR Deputy Min-
ister of Education Serafim Nikichev, arrived in Cuba on 5
December to spend a month "working on. the curriculum of
Havana University's School of Social Sciences." . Nikichev
was accompanied by. "academicians" Aleksandr Smirnov, Vassiliy
Rayike, and Maria Filipova. The group was. welcomed at Jose
Marti airport by the Rector and Deputy Rector of the univer-
sity, Juan Mier Febles and Mariano Rodriguez Solveira, and.
the 8chool 's protocol specialist, Professor Pedro Canas. The
delegation's trip to Cuba is the first tangible result of
the Soviet-—Cuban educational exchange agreement signed in Mos-
cow two months ago.’ That agreement provides for the loan
of Soviet academicians and educational administrators to
Cuban schools, the exchange of students and instructors be-
tween the two’ countries, and the use of Soviet texts in Cuba.

had been negotiating with a Spanish firm (probably CILASA)
for the sale. of US-origin construction equipment; after being
informed that the material was destined for Cuba and having
been warned of the consequences of such a sale, the director
agreed on 2 December to stop negotiations, The US consul
comments that it is not sure whether the knowledge of the
eventual sale to Cuba or the fact of US. intervention in the
matter caused Varmi to stop the arrangements.

Meanwhile, a source with access to CILASA's files re-
ported on 28 November that a Cuban comission headed by Rene
Narbona of the Cuban tractor importing agency would be unable
to arrive in Brussels on 30 November because of inability to
obtain visas, This group had probably been scheduled to com

Despite the Moroccan announcement of its break in diplo-
matic relations with Cuba, the Cuban ambassador is still in
Rabat and attends functions he normally attended. The
chancery offices are open and the Cuban flag is flying.

This situation has been a source of some embarrassment to
the Moroccan Foreign Ministry. However, the US Embassy
believes that the reception of the Cuban delegation by the
Moroccan Government may presage the official re-establish-
ment of diplomatic relations. An officer in the Spanish
Embassy in Rabat believes this is entirely possible; he be-
lieves the Soviets are using their influence to keep the
Cuban Embassy in Rabat. The US Embassy also feels that the
Moroccan King may not feel he received sufficient benefit
to justify continuing the break in diplomatic relations with
Cuba. (Am Emb Rabat 860, 4 December, CONFIDENTIAL)

The Swiss ambassador in Cuba was informed by the dep-
uty foreign minister that the preliminary hearing had been
completed for the US citizen Frank Emmick, who reportedly
will be. charged with being a CIA agent. (See Daily Summary
of 5 December.) The ambassador believes that Emmick's trial
will be held shortly after the completion of the OAS inves-
tigation into charges by Venezuela of Cuban intervention in
Venezuelan affairs. Currently, the ambassador is trying to
find a Cuban lawyer to defend Emmick. He is considering the
lawyer hired by the Canadian Embassy to defend the Cuban
pilots Lippert and Milne, an attorney who handles Swiss Em-
bassy. affairs, or a member of the Havana University Law
School faculty. (Am Emb Bern 363, 5 December, CONFIDENTIAL)

Prime Minister Williams of Trinidad. Tobago. gave a

had presumed on a scant acquaintance with him to visit Port-
of-Spain, despite advice from the government of Trinidad

that such a visit would be inopportune, Reportedly, the

prime minister turned down Sanchez' suggestion for trade
talks, on the grounds of Cuba's involvement with Venezuela
and Trinidad, Tobago's, delicate and difficult relations
with Caracas. He did not, however, close the door on such
discussions at some appropriate time in the future. The

' Havana Radio announced yesterday that pro-Castro guer-
rillas have established "six operational zones" in the moun-
tains around Santiago and Puerto Plata in the Dominican.
Republic. The Havana. radiobroadcast credited the announcement
to "the first communiqué issued by the command." Meanwhile,
press dispatches from Miami report that most Cuban exiles feel
that the Havana announcement is an attempt to cover up the
failure of Castro terrorists to stop Venezuela's presidential
elections last Sunday. Other exile sources predict that the
announcement and the setback in Venezuela mean:. that the.Castro
regime will launch a concerted terrorist campaign against the
military-installed provisional regime in Santo Domingo. Batista
Falla, leader of the Cuban exile Christian Democratic Movement
(MCD), said yesterday in Miami that the failure of terrorism
in Venezuela “has put Castro in a difficult position and damages
his chances in the rest of Latin America."' He added that he
expects Castro to "make desperate attempts to picture terrorism
as successful, despite its miserable failure in Venezuela,"

All reporting by the Dominican Government indicates that -
its forces are in effective control of the areas of guerrilla
activity. About 40 insurgents of the outlawed pro-Castro 14th
of June Political Group (APCJ) are said to have been captured,
with only isolated bands yet to be apprehended. (UPI, Miami,

Although this is the first report on the possibility of
a Cuban-sponsored Venezuelan government-in-exile, the Cuban
radio and press have been emphasizing the slogan that the
Betancourt government does not represent the people and that
the real representatives of the people are to be found in the
ranks of the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN). Ac-
cording to Cuban newspapers, Pedro Duno, a former professor
of the Central University of Venezuela, "arrived in Havana to

The OAS Investigating Committee which is looking into
the Cuban arms cache discovered in Venezuela does not intend
to limit its investigation to the cache. The group has no
intention to expand its study to cover domestic political as-
pects of the FALN or Communist Party activities; however, the
members expressed interest in looking into such aspects as
Cuban broadcasts inciting to violence, possible transfer of
funds from Cuba, training of Venezuelans in Cuba in subversive
techniques, and evidence of other clandestine arms shipments.
In addition to examining the arms cache, the committee also
voiced interest in hearing tapes of recent Cuban broadcasts, —
examining transcripts of interrogations and documents seized
from captured terrorists, saboteurs, and guerrillas, talking
to Venezuelan authorities responsible for combating terrorism
and insurgency, and possibly interviewing some prisoners. In
a meeting with the Committee, the Venezuelan foreign minister
placed emphasis on vverification of the Cuban origin of the
arms cache, but also indicated his government would furnish
all possible evidence on the Venezuelan complaint that the
