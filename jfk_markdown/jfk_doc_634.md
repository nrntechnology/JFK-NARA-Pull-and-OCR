He alse would be intimately acquainted with a large number
of Soviet agents working inside the USSR against American

KGB activities. would revolve around the intelligence
operations of the KGB in Moscow and also KGB personalities
working in Headquarters. NOSENKO was also undovbtedly

Yurty Dmitriyevicth KOROLEV, a Soviet journalist, visited
Paris and spoke: with representatives of the Freach magazine
Paris Match. KOROLEV indicated that he would like to serve
a8 a stringer for che French journal and proposed that he

begin with a atory on the life of the family of a "Soviet
secret agent”. As KORULEV spoke only broken French and
English, the magazine staff did not seriously pursue the
matter at that tine.

GOLITSYN have identified as an agence of the KGB
