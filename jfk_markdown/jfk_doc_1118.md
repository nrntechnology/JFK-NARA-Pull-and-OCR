REPORT ON THE COLD WAR USE OF RADIO BROADCASTING BY CIA

le Hadio As a Medium in the Cold War

ao The USSR. and its satellites, including China, broadcast
te countries outside the Orbit 15395 hours per week of aggressive psych= :
olexical WaTlEre.

The free world Fesponds with 1,015 hours per week.

Co ‘this gives the enemy a numerical, advantage of” approxinetely
seven to five. In reality, the Communist advantage ig mech greater oo.
because of their successful interference with free world broadeasts to the
Orbit through jamming and the penalties they impose on their own peoples
for Listening to foreign broadcasts. It is estimated that these measures
reduce the effectiveness of free world broadcasts to the Orbit by as much,
if not more than, 50 percent. An illustration is that the Commmists
devote an estimated 909 transmitters to the jamming of free world broad=
casts, There is no jamming of Orbit broadcasts. to the Western world, nor
any restrictions on listening to them. —

. ds Orly the English spealcing world holds its own numerically in
the over-all radio war with the Orbit. VOA, BFC and Canada together
broadcast 238 hours per week against the Orbits; whereas the Orbit countries
combined direct 222 hours per week to English language audiences in North
America, the United Kingdom, and the Pacific arca.

‘Go In the rest of the world, the balance is drastically in
favor of the Commnists. They broadcast 1, 173 jam-free hours to all
other countries around the world in multiple languages, compared with a
mere 26 hours broadcast to all Orbit countries vy noneEnglish speaking
nations of the free world, ,

f£. Of the total of 1,015 broadcast hours beamed by all the free
world to the Orbit, CTA, through TPTCNIC and other quasi-clandestine
stations, breadeasts 513 hours, or more than half, in the name of exlles
from Communist dominated arezs.

go The greatest disparity in effort is most noticeable in
Western Europe. France, which receives &9 hours of broadcasts per week
from the Orbit as-a whole, responds with only 35 to the Orbit. Italy
receives 97 hours from the Orbit but broadcasts only hh to it, Spain 94
to 12, Greces 89 to 9,-Turkey 3 to 7. Even relatively aggressive
Yugoslavia receives 19) brcadcast hours from the Orbit against its outout

to the Orbit of o &9 hours.
may 9 ox he The one~sided

he The one-sided contest is even vere marked in a comparison
of the breadeast output of the USER alone, without the satellites,
against Europe. It subjects Spain, Greece and Italy together, for
instance, to 140 hours of broadcasts per week. ‘The combined broadcasts
of these three countries to the USSR, however, number only 19 hours per
weeks France and Turkey who, together, receive 61; hours per week from
the USSR, make no broadcasts at all to the USSR. - :

i. Appendix I gives a compilation by country or area of the
international broadcasts to and from USSR and the satellites. It shows
that the Communists are outslugging the free world, and that Westera
Europe, in particular, is doing far less than it should in the radio
propaganda battle with the Orbit. -

26 Capabilities

Several techniques are available to CIA for the use of radio
broadcasting in its covert psychological warfare mission.

a. Overt international broadcasting on fixed frequencies under
cover of covertly controlled emigre groups. This technique normally
would be calculated to reach wide audiences by means of high power and
the use of miltiple frequencies; but it invites heavy jamming, is costly
and presents security, control and political problems in the acquisition
and maintenance of suitable bases and frequency allocations. :

Ree RH

bo Quasi-clandestine broadcasts in the name of notional or
"eaptive" resistance movements using relatively low power and employing
a frequency switching technique to evade jamming. This technique presents
more manageable security and control problems, delivers a signal in spite
of jamming and costs less than high power, but it places a burden on
listeners and presents special problems in avoiding interference with
broadcasts of friendly countries. .

i a a

Ce Subsidization of overt nonpolitical, but anti-Commnist,
religious broadcasts, . % 3 % :

; da. Through covert penetration and/or support, the maripulation
of free world domestic broadcasting systems for the purpose (1) streng=
thening their anti-Commmist broadcasts to the Orbit ancfor (2) influence
ing them to more aggressive anti-Communist, pro-Western attitudes in their
domestic services. =

This technique lends itself naturally to clandestine
operations. It requires a minimum of U.S. personnel, presents no

problems concerning

problems concerning bases ‘and “nateganent, and requires relatively
an2ll investments and. expense It would be advantageous beyond the
inmediate PP field, Jn such a post an agent could observe communist
infiltration, spot forthcoming political changes by observing changes
in government prepagands directives, recruit agents with reliable
cover for other covert undertakings and cooperate in planning for
dental of the facilities to an enemy in the event of hostilities.

te believe ait should be the agency's established policy
te carry out such penetrations wherever opportunities offer or can
be created. A glance at the vorld map is sufficient to indicate the _
immensity of this field of potentialities, ‘both as concerns the — -
countries on the peripheries. of the USSR and Communist China in -
Europe, the Near East and Far Easts and in Latin America as well. .
We prepose that an immediate start be made, in cooperation with Aree
. Divisions, on a country-by-country survey of possibilities in this
_Srea and that action be taken to achieve Penetration wherever this
study indicates 1% may be Feasible.

upon intelligence reports, interrogation of defectors, escapees

and exiles, indigenous newspapers and a regular flow of intercepts
from enemy broadcasts. These are indispensable to eredible, intere
esting, and timely broadcasts. Despite our vast potential resources
and large U.S. expenditures in these fields, the effective "take" is
far from adequate, rarely timely, and unnecessarily costly. FBID, VOL,
and several others monitor the same foreign broadcasts to extract the
sane or similar information. Several U.S. agencies interrogate the
same exiles for PW information, whereas a single interrogator, trained
in PU needs, could supply most, if not all, the requirements not only
for all radio but all other Pu activities better and faster. A cleared
consultant, on behalf of one of our more successful operations, pro-
duced on abundance co? excellent support information and evaluation
data. The same data, properly sterilized and speedily disseminated,
could equally serve the VOA and any other covert or overt Bi effort
tergeted to the same area.

This complex problem needs a high level decision
by State and CIA and the appointment of a small team of officers
experienced in both PW and interrogation work with power to devise
an effective and efficient program to exploit our rich resources,

do To Deliver a Signal. That Cam Be Heard

(1) Soviet jamming of propaganda broadcasts raises
serious questions concerning our ability to deliver a signal that
can be heard above the jamming. Ye be sure, some of our breadcasts
get through because they are unable simltaneously to jam broadcasts
in all areas nor do they in practice jam a given broadcast trans-
mission at sll hours.

For future plarming purposes, however, these factors
seem clear:

(a) Soviet capabilities for jamming are large and
on the increase. ;

(b) The degree of their jamming seems to be re=
lated to their estimate of the harmful effect of the broadcasts on
their interests. Hence, the more effective parts of our propaganda
are Likely to be jammed even though other parts get through.

(c) We have no present capabilities te monitor
their jamiing if they use-=as they probably do in congested areas-=
lowspowered local. jammers.

(2) Prudent planning would, therefore, require that
any substantial future investments by CIA in radio broadcasting
transmitters include provision for all possible techniques te ensure
our broadcasts being heard to the maximum in spite of jamming.

(3) What techniques

2 6 »

HW 50955 Docld:32424022 Page 10 SECRET

Security Information

(3) What techniques are available to meet this require:
ment? .

(2) To deliver a signal of such power as te be
heard above the jamming. Here we are at a disadvantage in that a
Low<powered and inexpensive lecal jammer is capable of rendering .
unintelligible a signal of substantially higher power from a distant
Point. The greater the power of our transmitter the more complicated
the installation and the mere expensive the investment. And the more
diffieult becomes the cover and security problems as well as the
political considerations involved in base negotiations. Since the
eneay is not required to equel our power with his jammers, we would
therefore be fighting a losing battle if we attempted to "slug it out!
on & power basis only. :

(b) Jamming evasion through the device of vary- 7
ing the frequency has so far proven to be an effective means of lay~
ing dow a signal that can be heard clearly despite jamming. This
method requires constant dial changing by the listener and must
assume therefore a desire on his part to hear the program sufficient
to overcome the annoyance of dial twisting. When used in combination
with appropriate programming techniques and the use of tuo or more
frequencies simitaneously this has so far proven to be the most
effective means of jamming avoidance. .

Such frequency shiftings cannot be accomplished
within the Lega). rules laid down for international broadcasting.
These mst, therefore, be “black” broadcasts in the sense that they
can be credibly denied by our Government as well as the goverment
of the host country. The movement at will through various frequencies
produces an annoying interference for the listeners to broadcasters to
whom those frequencies are legally assipned. This interference, while
fully justified in the case of USSR and satellite assigned frequencies,
must be avoided in the case of frequencies assigned to our friends.

: Our broadeasts using this technique have so
fay avoided annoyance to friendly countries by the use of very lew
pover, This Limits us to 4 small part of the total Soviet Orbit
target and that only on the periphery. The same techniques can be
used with higher power and at greater distances from the target. —
fo-aveid interference with friendly nations' broadcasts the base
must be lecated in an area which, with the proper antenna adjuat=
ments, permits our signal to "skip* over the territory of friendly
countries in its path. An example would be that, given a transmitting
‘bass in Saudi Arabia for broadcasts to the USSR, the facility would
have to be engineered so that its signal would not interfere with.
local, broadeast reception in Turkey and other friendly countries in

betucen.
(ce) The development ef unconventional broadcasting

techniques for the penetration of enemy domestic radio broadcasting
services might well enable us to overcome the handicaps imposed by
the jamming of our conventional breadeasts to the Soviet orbit and
seize the cold war initiative in the radio sphere. It is a field
which has been neglected thas far.

; ” Seine possibilities in this area are described
in the otProjest froy" report of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Vol. wv, Annex 26) of 1 February, 1951.

an _dmong then: is the “intrusion,” or "side-band
injection,” technique which was used successfully by the Russians
against Germeny during World War Il, It would enable us to intrude
our own propaganda messsges into radio programs being broadcast on
“enemy home channels. It would enable us in effect to talk to the -
' Soviet, satellite and neutral radio audiences. over enemy facilities
_or compel the enemy to disrupt his own broadcast service in an effort ~
to prevent it. It could also be used in turning Soviet propaganda
broadcasts to Western Europe toe the advantage of our friends. The Troy
report observes as to’ the technique itself: es
: “This would be an effective and annoying
tomntque which would be extremely difficult. to counter."

Utilization of this technique appears to. be
within our. “capabilities at the moment. It has been fiéld tested
_and is ready for use ag soon as the necessary technical adaptations
ean be made to conventional transmitters. The time and cost involved
in mounting a facility for utilising this technique is now being ;
explored by ADCO at the suggestion of this office.

: . Another unconventional technique being devel~
oped by an agency consultant and now almost ready for field testing
‘ds the so-called "cuddling" device. This operates on the theory that
we can tranamit an interfering aigaal into an orbit domestic radio.
service which will cause the listening audience to shift.to our —
nearby program in endeavoring to tune out the interference on his
own home program. .

Other unconventional means of carrying the
cold war to the Orbit by means of clandestine radio might. be cap-_
able of invention and development, and the scientific and practical
potentialities in this field should be explored to the utmost.

This office is convinced that emphasis must
be placed more and more on unconventional radio broadcasting tech-
niques if the cold war of the air waves is not to become more one-
sided than it already is in favor of the Commnists. Properly devel-
oped and utilized, those techniques already perfected or in the pro-
cess of perfection and those which might be invented might even be
