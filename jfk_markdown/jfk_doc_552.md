° 1, Per our discussion of 2 July 1962, Ieexpect that we
shatl proceed to transfer QJWEN to Baden-Baden per the proposal
in QLUA-1463 dated 2 February 1962, LUXEZ0489 dated 19 June
1962 stated that CoS would have the full details of the
capital outlay required by 23 June; however, the Information
has not -been received as of 3 July, The last cable to the

Station, DIR 18391 told COS to contact you directly on his
arrival on 16 July. :

2, With regard to candidates spotted by QJWIN, the
two whom he spotted in Italy a year and @ quarter ago can
probably be used if needed, if we can accept the assessments
of them by the Trieste Base contract agent, Magonetti,
Magonetti's assessment is contained in OTRAZ27542 dated
10 May 1961, The names of the two French candidates are con-
tained in QOLLA.1226 dated 15 December 1961. No action has
been taken on7’these names regarding tracing or anything else.
My handwritten notes attached to that dispatch contain
fuller descriptions of the two people than appear in the

dispatch.

3. -The other spotting effort that can be made is
through {Hank Manfredil (TN) in Rome, {Nank)was well briefed
on the qualifications desired and the security precautions
to be observed in the spotting activity, COS Rome has a
copy of the qualifications and restrictions in his safe;
however, if Manfredil is told to proceed with his contact in
Florence, I Suggest that he be re-briefed in detail,

6. Despite COS LUXE‘s viewpoint, I happen to know that

QJWIN can do more spotting in Corsican circles whenever we
want him to, ° .
