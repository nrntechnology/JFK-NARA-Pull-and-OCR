Appraisal of & tt 3

: 1. Contrary to the reports which are issued by the Cuban Goverment, the

H , financial status of the Cuban econony is rapidly deteriorating and

! beconing a serious problem. During July 1959 an advisor to Prime.

i Minister Fidel CASTRO Rua, warned him to proceed more alowly with the
agrarian reform, because the Cuban treasury was running short of funds.

. It was pointed out that 57 sygar mils were barkrupt and had not paid

>. ' the plantation owners for the 1959 sugar crop. CASTRO waa told that

if the reckless confiscation of agricultural properties ccntinued, the

Cuban Goverment would become obligated to assume even more debts in

order to alleviate the hunger of farz workera.l

2. Another drain va the econony is goverment subsidies, For example,
the danco de Desarrollo Economico y Social (BANDES, Social and
Economio Development Bank) coutrols about U.S. $400 nillion in
properties ani investments such as the Compwiia Cubana de Aviacion
(Cuban Airline Company). The companies have been caught in the
presont contraction of capital and cannot survive without government
subsidies, The subsidies paid by BAND=S amount to U. S. $8 million
a month, and this is only one exemple of the many payments vhich are
draining toe Cuban ‘treasury .2 : .-

Eleld Corments.

1. Freomthe-reports -which-have-been-received {t appears that there is
grvwing unemployment of farm yorkers. This is the “dead season*--
the period between sugar cens harvests—-but it is reported that
most plantation. owners and ranchers are fearful of confiscation of

: their properties for the agrarian-reform program)/and consequsntly

: are doing very little in the way of maintenance vork. The latter

i Provided tat ase @ marginal field of employment, and this is now
denied to the agricultural workers, However, spite of this
warring, the dgrarian-reform program has not been aloved. In
fact, it seems to have been intensified,

2. ae Goures thought that nothing could stop CASTRO Jn his determination : og 1
UO to proceed vith the agrarian reform progran a3 fast as possible. Since i 7
the biggest obstacle to carrying out this program is the lack of money, i
tho ‘hource was of the opinion that CASTR) vould do anything to obtain . {
this money aai might even confiscate bank accounts and moneys and nego-

tiable irstrusents held in safety deposit doxes. Carrying this one :

step furthar, the yource thought such cowfiscatory tactics could only, - ;
be a teaporary eating dovice and that eventually it would be necessary |
for CASTIO te obtain a large lean fro: another country. Fe speculated oe
that this vould mean either the United States or the Suviet Union, and . :
feared that if it vere the lattery/it would rean the end of friendly

‘relations with the United States. In respect to CASTRO's possible _ OS 4
need for a loan, another, fairly reliable, source reported on 18 August : .
1959 that Casta) was trying te obtain a W,000,000-peso loan from dost f

banks.
