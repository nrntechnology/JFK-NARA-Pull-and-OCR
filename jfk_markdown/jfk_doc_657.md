Towards the latter part of 1957, as a result of an increasing aumber

of alarming reports concerning alleged Communist penetration and sermort
of Fidel Castro's 26 of July Movezent operating in the Sierra vaestra
mountains, the destern Hemisphere Digision became aware of the urgext need

- to mount an operation to acquire first-hand“and relizble information and.
data on the Cuban rebel forces. In early January 1958, Mr. Crozier

volunteered to undertake the precarious mission to contact Fidel Castro

in his mountain retreat in the Sierra Maestras. He arranged for his free

Manzanillo on 26 March 1958 At Manzanillo, Vaivada broke off contact with : : .
the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana. Jt i

Vaivada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational i 1
information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographic ; !
coverage of his trip. - i

past performances of Arthur G, Vaivada, who has always shown a deep devotion.
to his work and to the Agency. .

MEMORANDUM .
ee fhe Marvedar :
SUBJECT: Subject of our letter nuiwer 4U25; Interest in Assignment
in JU. 5s, :

D pagel weet
elit] Say :
: 1. In recent conversations with both JRp and RDS, Subject has
! broachea the prospect of a possible assignment within the U.S. follow.
a ing completion of pis Habana assignrent. He Says he would not wat his
i Statements re reassignment which were recently forwarded to Headquartars
i . to be interpreted to nean tnat he is not interested in a U.S, tour, He
: Says that he has been giving mich thought to his future career, a8 well
as to the needs of nis family, ie points out that he personally has now.
. Spent approximately 16 years, excepting vacations and short training :
periods, living ma working outside tne U. S,, that nis two cnilaren
have never lived tnere, and tnat poth he and his wire are concerned
: that too’ mch time will elajse befcre they can provide their children
i With a period in the U. 5, during taeir formative years,

| 2. It is the opinion of both HDS and JKP that Subject is at a

i point in his career development wnere a tour at Headquarters would Loe
| be extremely beneficial, The Station lacks knowledge conceming the : H

H Specific deaaquartars jobs to wnich a person of Subjects status might H

i be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR soretimes emplcys 4

: these persons as instructors, ie believe that a tour with OTh would . i

i not only remedy in great measure deficiencies in Subdject’s background © F H
caused by lack of Headquarters experience, but would at the sane time +
i afford OiR excellent instructor material, '

3. In view of Subject’s own interest in such an assignment, and
our estimate of tas potential value to nim and to the Organization
that would accrue from it, we recorsmend tnat Headquarters arrange such
am assignment if at all possible.

hb. In view of the likelihood of Subject’s transfer in tha near’
future, a prompt decision is requested. , : :

FROM : Acting Chief of Statin

SUBJECT: GeneRa—Cserational

seccric—Arthur G. VAL

Reference: HkH-N-2380, deted 16 October 1957-

1. The Subject has no objection to subaitting to an LOFLUTTER test
at the convenience of Headevarters, This could be eesily arranged here
jn the event an LOFLUTTER team is passing, or could pass, through Habana;
on the cther hand, VAIVADA could just es easily go to any designated solace
in Plorida in order to take this test. It is undersi-od that LOFLUTT:
teams from time to time visit that state.

2. ‘The Station will take such measures as are feesible to cover the
activities of Subject and his wife while in Aabane.

3. While the watter was not roferred to in the reference, Susject’s
projected one-year tour of duty will end in dune, 1958, at which time it
is YAITADA’s desire to leave Cuba for a reassignment in arcther area in
his oresent line of overational work and under similar unofficial cover
conditions. A detailed dispatch on this subject will shortly be trans-
mitted to Heedquarters; it is referred to here so that the readquarters
desk may te alerted to the need for considering what assignments would
be open to VATVADA during the Spring or Surmer of 1958.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI

SUBJECT t Request for Conversion cf Arthur CG. WATVADS From
Contract to Staff Status

REFERENCE t HKH-A-2577

1. Referenced dispatch fron the field recommends the conversion
of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents
& strong case for such conversion, VAIVADA has served la in a con-
tract capacity since 1949, with a continuous high level of perfor.
mance; first in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba. He is cure
rently assigned to Cuba and is expected to remain there indefinitely.
VAIVADA is 34 years-old and was promoted recently to the equivalent’
of a GS-10 rating. His expressed career interests Lie in contimed

‘employment by CIA, more especially in the area ofunofficial cover

assignments, for which he is highly suited. .

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1945) is a Costa Rican
citizen, a situation which complicates his proposed conversion som-=

what. She has expressed a desire to acquire U.S. citizenship, hovever,

and it has been determined that this can be arranged within the next
several months, barring unforeseen developnents. She will be required

“to spend most of this period in the U.S. and is currently making
. plans. to do. so. a : , :

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agent,
his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire fora |
eareer with CIA, it is recomended that he be granted staff status
at grade GS-11, contingent upon his wife's first becoming a U.S.
citizen, and providing he can meet Security and other requirements.
There is available in WH Division a staff. position (BAF-L09) to
which VAIVADA can be ‘assigned. .

4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for

covert training in the near future.

S. Approval for the conversion of VAIVADA from contract to
staff status, as indicated above, is hereby requested,

Myers was to discuss the matter further with other elements of =
Security and advise within the next several days as to what the next
step should be. :

2. Considering the possibility that such a request might be
turned down, the undersigned discussed with Pennington the proce. Lo -
dures for acquisition of citizenship for Mra. VAIVADA, and deter-- °°”
mined that this should be relatively simple. The requirements were: :
Presence in the 0.3. (vicinity of Washington) for approximately . =
forty-five days with some additional time to. acquire’ passport: So - Mae
long as we have nothing that would make. her inadmissable to the.U.S.. -

"the basic requirements would bér ability:to speak. Englisn and to
pass a relatively simple test based on pamphlet which would be giver -
to her for study." Security would presumably handle her case when -
she arrives in -the States. woe : ”

3. It has occurred to. the uadersigned that perhaps,-if it is
necessary for Mraz. VAIVADA to acquire citizenship, VAIVADA hinself .
could be brought to the Washington vicinity for trainiag’ purposes .

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 1 Proposed Staff Status for Arthur. G. VATVADA
REFERENCE : HEH-A-2577, 17 April 1956

1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion
of contract agent Arthur C. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents a
good case for such conversion. VAIVADA has served CIA in a contract:
capacity since 1949 with a continuous high level of performance; first
in Costa Rica, later in Guatemala and Cuba.. He is°34 years old and”
was psomoted recently to the equivalent.of a grade GS-10. His ex-
pressed career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, ‘mere —
@specially in the area of unofficial cover assignments, for which
he is highly suited.

Ye

2. Unfortunately Subject's spouse. “(since 1945) 48 a Costa:
Rican citizen. Prelininary ‘investigation at Headquarters has revealed
on that Subject's conversion to staff status ‘is virtually out of the —
an ‘question so long as hia wife remains an alien. It has also been de~ ¢
° . termined, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citizenship within. .
a span of h5 days if she so desires and is willing to. come to the .
~ US. for that period of time.” This would remove the major stumbling
block to acquisition of staff status for VAIVADA. . “t

3. In view of VATVADA'a outstanding record as a contract agont,
his strong overall qualifications and his expressed desire for a ca- |
reer with CIA, it 1s recommended that (a) VAIVADA's wife be encoursged ©
to seek U.S. citizenship | under ‘the terms outlined above (b) VAIVADA.,
be granted staff status, ‘contingent upon his wife's. first becoming .
a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet all other’ requirements. Lo
C/WH/III has endorsed the récommendation for staff status and a sug-
gestion by C/WH/Admin that BAF-L09, a new position carrently alloted
to San Jose, be- transferred to Habana to ‘be filled by VaIVaDA.. -

| (be Tt ts further reccomended that UH Division consider bring. |.
ing. VWAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincidée-with his wife's
stay (at Headquarters! convenience). . This would. facilitate acquisi- ~
tion of citizenship for the wife and at the same tine afford VAIVADA

consideration has been given to a number of ideas) atl of which were
rejected because possible local conflicts.. This idea is still general
i enough (and I hope convincing) to lesve opportunity for changes and/or
: improvement at Headquarters, The idea, and the terminology, was
i gleaned from the pages of "Investrent in Cuba", a July 1956 study
' published by the U.S. Department of Commerce,

: . . 2 As I understand this cover arrangement, the P3I sheuld mail me

; a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed information. This

i should "hold us" for a couple of months, with cossibly some queries from
me occasionally, Then when our operational picture requires investigation
in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to
request a survey or poll in that field. -

3. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and

;

i of this "Agency" and ther advise PSI as to the legal requirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

. SUBJECT: Vaivads

1. During the morning of 30 April Mr. Millard of Cover tele-
phoned regarding Subject, citing IN 35508. Mr. Millard said that
; he would be meeting.with Vaivada at 1600 hours today and proposed
io providing him with a temorary rather than permanent cover with
: the new cover company which was being contemplated for long-range
development. Mr. Millard's reasoning yas that he did not wish
to place Vaivada under the new company with the chance that the
trial period approved for. the Station might cause Vaivada to be
: : pulled out from that cover in short order. lf, Millard said that
| the temporary cover he intended offering Vaivada would be adequate.
