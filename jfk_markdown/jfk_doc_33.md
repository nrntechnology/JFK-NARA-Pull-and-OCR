itvORANDUX FOR THE RECORD: | a cee
SUBJECT: BSHEIREN and the Four U.S, avy Desertors a

“origin ana and Dovelopaent t of BEHSIREN

oe Founding: - BEHEIREN (Japan "Peace for Vietnam" Com

was organized in ei ae EEE
Gndependent group of intellectuals and cultured persons whose .
purpose was “to help restore peace in Vietnam." Actually, ite
is a loosely organized group of ox-JCP. members, progressive.
intellectuals, leftist cultured persons, and leftwing students |
- banded together in the name of opposition to the Vietnam war. i
by two common denominators, dedicated anti-Americanism and=; _
vefusal to bs dominated or controlled by the orthodox x Japan
Communist Party. ~ ..

s Be Rard-Core Secretariat: - “The real ‘force behind the.
organization of BEESIREN, right from the beginning -to the.
present, has been a brilisant Communist named YOSHIEAWA.
Zuichi. whose conspiratorial organizational skills bavé -

een perhaps the most indispensible ingredients in BEHEIREN‘’s
development. YOSHIKAWA was expelled from Tokyo University
for his role as a ZENGAKUREN leader in the 1960 U.S./Japan™
Security Treaty riots. He then went into fulltime JCP mass
movement professional work, becoming the Secretariat official’
in charge of international relations for the Japan Peace :
Committee. YCSRYKAWA breke with the JCP in late 1964, .
following the rupture in relations between the JCP and CPSU
.dn May that year. The inspiration for BERBLIREN springs in’.
‘large measure from YOSHIKAWA's personal desire to use his
organizational talents in countering the JCP and its Japan
Peace Committee. YOSHIEAWA, in addition to being a2 well .
‘qualified English linguist himself, years. ago surrounded
‘himself? with a small following of similarly qualified:
licutenants, whom he brought along into BEREIREN to give
“him the necessary depth and experience to run this new ©

- / 3. Respectable Intellectual Front: Folilovwir -
mental Communist principles for ase novenent were cee ce
‘than the JCP itsel? follows these tenets), the ex-JCP .
organizers of BEREIREN kept themselves in the background -
and lined up a number of prominent Japanese: progressive. .
intellectuals and leftist cultured persons to front for  —
BEREIREN. The choice of OBA Uakoto, ex-Fulbrighter and —
popular young novelist, to be the chief front man — Chair-
man - Was an extremely lucky stroke for BEHEIREN. ODA has
‘taken to this grand-standing, front work like a duck to. 09°.)
water. It has given him 2 chance to give unbridled vent ta: -
bis own latent anti-American foelings, puffed him up to the
extent that he has been dubbed “the emperor" by other BEHEIREN .
activista, and given him at long last an ideological mission .—
to pursue. ‘YOSHIKAWA has performed magnificently in feeding
: ODA's ego needs and in infusing and indoctrinating ODA so. |
that his words and actions take on sufficiently virulent. -
“ anti-Anerican overtones, ODA has served another vital. 00°00")
function for BENEIREN by recruiting a sizeable number of :
fellow intellectuals to join the ranks of BEHEIREN activists.
(Attachnent 1 is a listing of a number of those Japanese who |.
have been identified as active BEHEIREN supporters or aympa~ ..

hizers.}

\ 4. Organizational Development: In its 2 “1/2 year history,
BEELIREN has not appreciably changed its organizational format,
eithough it has moved its office three tines and modified its ...
mame even oftener. PEHEIREN ig not a “mass organization", be-° .
cause it has bad no ‘sizeable popular backing to the present -- :
timc. Its hard core, secretariat organization is run by = =...
YOSHIKAWA and his lieutenants. Its public image, inteliectual ..
_front is led by ODA, and given body by a score of like-minded me
‘intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAGA, who form the loose... -
_ body of BEHEIREN's activist leadership... Under this BEDEIREN ...
leadership superstructure lies a paltry base of only several
‘hundred BEHEIREN “rank-and-file“::supporters, mostly young .  :
‘Japanese students. Organizationaily, BEHEIREN has no ferrsl .
‘ gembership system, so its base of supporters is fluid and not)...
precisely measurzble. However, the base support for BEHBIREN ||
hss definitely been on the upswing during 1967, and made such... *
notable strides during the past summer that JCP Headquarters ©
officials finally feit constrained to note with concern that ~ _
BEBEIREN was beginning to drain off a growing number of pro- °°
gregsive youth who otherwise would have been absorbed into oo
the JCP's own youth movement. BEHEIREN leaders:.have tried to. .
‘help this growth along hy setting up 2 youth section, calling ,
at "Young BEHEIREN." BEERIREN's imaginative actions and.
“ publicity-conscious programs have been responsible for its .
:; .gecent growth, and this period of growth seems to be now on

14-000

the verge of - renlly ‘pleking up speed. and momentun.”- “AB a result. ;

of its role in the case of the four deserting sailors, BEHEIREN °..
has reaped bountiful publicity, has succeeded in touching a

delicate Japanese public nerve of sympathy and pacifism, open---: |
ing a floodgate of support for BEHEIREN from all, over Japan. ee
When this case fades from the limelight, it is still most ~~ ~.-
likely that a fair percentage of current wave of _popular

support fox BEHEIREN wil i rmanent mass backing, a

support its future activities, -

&. Activities and Accomplishnents: “ BEBEIREN has engaged
in a number of propaganda actions, and. participated in inter~-
national anti-Vietnam War activities. It has tried to co- «© ~.:
operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by.
the JCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War
Crimes in Vietnam activitiés, which culminated in the Tokyo  .
Court of last Atigust, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed.
by the JCP. In spite of this, BEHEIREN has churned along at.
its own pace, with a continuing series of anti-Vietnam war. ~-
actions, most of. them related in some way to the American - re
pacifist movement. In this regard, BEHEIREN has succeeded in:
cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the U.S...)
pacifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to i ae
promote its own action program. The case of the four aaah hea
sailors, while an- apparent lucky windfall for BEHEIREN, only
points up the fact that BEHSIREN, through past organizational |
work and promotional activities, was “johnny~on-~the-spot", _-
ready and capable (unique in Japan in this regard) to take - |
-the ball and run with it. BEMEIREN ran all the way in this”
case and scored its most notable success since it was organized. .
