bursement for 75% of the excess allowable costs up to,
put not in excess of , 60% of the standardized quarters

On a 50/50 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he
would be out-of-pocket $870 if his costs were $4,640.

On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he

. 1, You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to
the retention of future royalties which might be earned by Terence S.
CRABANAC as a result of his literary efforts. We believe that he is

” entitled to retain such royalties without an offset against his Agency

salary.

: 2. We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that
CRABANAC'!s cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC!s
. cover for status will only be a light one of a retired Foreign Service
Officer. Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may.
remain as written, Royaltics from the fictional works that he writes as
a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his

"cover activities."
