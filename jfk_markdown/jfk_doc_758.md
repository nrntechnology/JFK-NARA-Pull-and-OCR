14-00000

Dr. 2:IRO sald there wae no way to detarmine the accuracy
of tho figures given of plaves, guns, otc. received from the Soviet bloc
(end aly and Canada) but even if the figures wero exageratad 100 per
font, they would still be tmpresaive.

: - He added that Castro ta daily becoming stronger militarily
with weapone and with a large militia of close to 300, 060 being trained
to use them while the ecozomy continue to deteriorate. Ferbaps aly
half the militia would be effective, But that is sizeable, Thus, he said,
the Janger the dolay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, the
Greater will be the tash. ‘Wo must act goon, vigorously and effectively,
to ineuro victory. Anothor defeat would be disastrous and would make
Cubans, Latia Arsericans and others believe Castro to be invincible,
Then would come accommodationa and ever worss, the {raplanting of
Castro-bached regizsea in the hoausphere., And the U. S. would suffer
worst of all, being discradited for defeat and ‘“Wguilt of interforence, "'

so

“In tho UN no nation would stand beside the U. 5.

6, Proposal that Council 39 to Cuba with Commando Group and

Establish a Government on Cuban doit

Dr. MIRC then declared that he was ¢oavinced that Castro
weuld never be overthrown by all the propaganda, tho sabotace, commaado
ralde, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating
economy, and that it wag inconceivable to establish a governmontdrexile
for nothing would ¢- me of it; that the only solution for defeating tho
Castro regime wap for the Revelutidnary Couacil to Bo to Cuba and estab-
lish a yovernmert on Cuban Boll, ask recognition by all friendly countries
and military assistance of its priminal ally, the U. 4., and that the U.S.
be ready to intervene immediately with its Forces. This would all have
to take place ina matter of 42 hours, otherwise it would fail, I recognize
that thio ts a bold plan, but boldnosg 49 necessary. Thore will be many
risks, many may be killed, As for myoelf, I don’t care if I die, Ihave
fest all my persona! possesstuns and my son t3 a prisoner," He rejtorated
that all must be well propared in advance, there mast be no vacillatioa,
Svorytiing must proceed Fapidly. Firet, a comaisaado raid tn force to
asize a piece of Cuban territory, prefarably near Cuantanamo, and imme.

Before such an actin ja undortaken, the enemy must be
Softened by propaganda, sabotage, raids, underground action, and the
mass of the people of Cuba roust be Prepared to accept the Provisional
government through propaganda, increased knowledge of tha Council

and ite unifying efforts,

- Dr, MIRO asked me what I thought of this Project; did I think
that Castro could be overthrown tn any other way. I adroitted that
strong military action sppoared necessary. I otatod further that
of course his plan would have to be studied at the highest government
levels. He proposod that ho micht elaborate a plan with his militar y
collaborators, and I Suggested that ho do thie oo that it might be oxamined

and considered,

Dr. MIRG doclared that he wap convinced that this Communist
daggor in the cide of the States could enly ba eradicated by such action,
that the U.3. i9 and will be blamed fsr al! anti-Castro Propaganda,
sabotage, etc. and that enemy states will denounce it for iatervention
in Cuba, but that U the UL ©, 22e8 to the aid of a {rlendly revolutionary
regime established ia the country and helpa it defeat the Covtet-backed
Communist regime, all fzlendly governments will applaud,

“I have no personal political ambitions, ' declared BAO,
“I merely am trying to chair the Council, whose mission is to unify the
sati-Castro clemeats inside and outside of Cuba, If the team ton't con-
sidered effective, then change the pitchar, But I believe the Council must
eatabliah ftself on Cuban oul, and soon. Tima §s against os. "The . unta
del Este agreement will backfire against the U.S. if Castro Is allowed
to remain in Cuba. Ina year, alter the politicos of the countries ra-
colving U. 8. ald have gotten their hands on U. 8, gold, they will say,
*Thanke to Cactro, we got this." And they wil) spend it ag 2p the past

channel for {unde and coordinating the activities of groups outside the
Consejo such as the Students, FORD (Labor), ote. » Taaid that I under-
Stood that sore of these eloments were unwilling to function under the
Consejo; and that tn view of that eituation, did he consider that an :
Activity Committee might be organised with a dolegato from each of
these groups and under the chatrmanship of a member of the Consejo,
Thia would sorve to coordinate their activities, give thom a tie-in with
the Consejo, yet not make them subservient to it. Dr. MIRO replied
that this would morely set up cacther Consejo outside of and parallel to
the exiating Consejo, I did not pursue this further, not having enough
background of these organisations to be able to diszuse tho matter.
