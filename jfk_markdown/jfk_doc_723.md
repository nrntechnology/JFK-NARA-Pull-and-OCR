Dear Mr. Naksymiec:

This letter 4s in response to the comment you made
fo the Pirector on Alumni Day, 26 April 1975, concerning
@ special nedsllion for NPIC employees who participated .
dn the Cuban aissilo crisis,

T have had the appropriate records reviewed: The
Certificate of Commendation you and other NPIC employoes
received was awarded by direction of the President .in
recognition of the meritorious service perforaed,

‘It is hoped that the lack of a medallion to accompany
this certificate will in no way detract from the contribu-
- tion you made during this period of crisis, ;

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of - Personnel
Fred:

1. The facts behind the question raised with the-
Director by Mr. Maksymec on Saturday, 26 April, are,
according to him, as follows. . : >

i. \
2. After NPIC had done its fine work during the

Cuban missile crisis it appears that two different types
of recognition were given. Determinations were made
first on Certain individuals whose contributions were
such that they should receive an Agency medal award. A
second group of some 200 were then identificd for their
level of.contribution and received some kind of certifi-
cate from the White House signed by the President. Mr.
Maksymec was in the latter group and espouises the cause
that a "special medallion" should have been given along

‘with the White House certificate. Mr. Rob Gaynor also

spoke to me’ on this matter on Saturday, and has a good
recollection on the whole matter.

3. Will you do what you can on the matter and pre- .

‘pare me a letter to be sent to Mr. Maksynec?

MEMORANTUM FOR THE RECORD
SURECT: Mr. Myroslaw Maksymiec ~ Netired Employee

The nieeting vith Mr, Maksymiec ‘on 6 May 1975 was to satisty his
sto review his officlal personnel rile (this matter was

treated’ in the manner of @ request under the Freeda: of
Information Act). _ Location: -Main Reception Interview Rowa at
Headquarters Building - 3-pom, :

Tae duration of the meeting was one (1) hour of vhich tine
Nz. Maksymiec used approximately 7 ta 9 minutes to quickly thunb.-
thru the OPF, It fs my lopresston that he was ourprised: 1) ve .
vere allowing hin to see all the matertal in. the rile ( he éescribed-
vividly, a loO7L unpleasant encounter with Mr, Echols, the Direstor
or Fersonnel, vho refused to show him a document: and would aniy
réa¢ to him @ suall portion from it - this caused his Feques? and
subsequent Interview with the DCI, Mr. lelma), and 2) at the
reality that the file contained nothing actually derogatory
(he stated he had seen and signed the fitness reports so these
represented nothing unknown).

" GO-vorkers at NPIC and their shortcomings, He regaled me with
mush of his background and history with the military and initial
application and entrance on duty with the Agency; his ‘personal :
acquaintance and relationships vith notables - a former American
Azbassador to Ethiopia, Joseph Simonson, the Emperor of Sthiopia,
several Generals and Congressional Personalities, Mr. Helms and
Mr. Arthur Lundahl, and his membership in the Explorer Club, .

Presently he is Vice President for Sales of the Environmental
Coating Industries Corporation located in Annandale, Virginia ~
the company removes corrosion and stains from surfaces. He .
ofrered the company services at the OTH Alunat session, to
clean the stains from the Nathan Hale statue at the front of the.
building, at a cost of $300. He plans to follow-up on his pros
posal, since he has not heard anything from the Agenzy.

14-00000

He mentionéd that Mr. Blake, at the direction of the ol,
(1975 Alumni Day) vas to explore and advise him (Makaymiec) of the
posalbllity of. striking and issuing a medal to about 200 Agency
personnel (of whom ne ia one) for their participation in certain
aspects of the 1942 Cuban erisia. :

Our meeting ented with Mr. Maksymiec indicating he had ‘no \
intention of "going efter anybody," but he was curious what was in .
his file, and that vas the basis for asking to see it. {

I concur with the rater's comments. We have been making every effort
to aid Mr. Maksymiec in becoming an asset to RED as a laboratory technician,
To date, there has been little noticeable progress; in fact, the temper out-
bursts menticned above indicate a deteriorating condition. Unless this
Situation improves, it may be necessaty to recommend tersination action.

As. I have stated in previous comments, it's unfortunate that he cannot
find a position which takes advantage of his expertise in photography, since
this would go a long way to resolving his problems.

changed trom ad hoc researcn protects to a directed provran of planned investi-
e#ations against NPIC and community problems. This chanve tn activities reduced
the freedom of choice in taszs to be accomplished..and increased the demand for

This review course in yrammar and ounctuation was too advanced
for Mr. Maksymiec. Hoe neds an elementary course on the English
fundamentals preferably on a tutorial basis before he can adequataly
apply the rules of ounctuation and rrammar to his work.

In a personal conference with Mr. Maksyridec, the instructor
analyzed his weaknesses in grammar and punctuation and suggested
ways in which he might improve his performance in these areas.

August 24, 1966

; Name: Mr, Myroslaw A, Maksymiec

i Mr. Myroslaw A. Maksymice, age "9, came to this Bureau on August 1,
1966, in connection with the Veterans Administration's educational and

! vocat ional counseling program for former servicemen, Mr, Maksymiee is

| married, has two children, ayes five and cight, and is employed by a federal

! governmental agency as a photographic research technician (G3 99/3). He

i retired. From the United States Army in 1961 in the grade of Master Sergeant

i “after Serving for over 26 years with primary duties as an intelligence

i * photographer. His education includes Cight years of Formal schooling, a

| - / high sehool completion equtvalence certificate, and additional courses with

i the Graduate School, Department of Agriculture, and the United States Armed

| Forces Institute. Mr. Maksymiec stated that he was interested in further

i education at the college level in order to improve himself hoth personally

| and Professionally ina field related to his present’ vocational activities,

i : :

i

i

,

In addition to several conferences with the undersigned, Mr. Maksymiec
was administered a battery of educational and vocational tests. This report
contains the results. of these conferences and tests, the results of which
should not be interpreted either as conclusive or final. They should be
considered primarily as indications of various psychological factors that
should be seriously considered by Mr. Maksymiec in making decisions concer-:
ning his educational and vocational goals, oa ,

| In order to determine Mr, Maksymiec's fields of vocational ‘interest :
i he was given the Kuder Vocational PreForence Record, When compared to a. :
} representative group of men in the National populat ion, Mr. Maksymiec in-
dicated that his interests are Significantly similar to persons who are
engaged in computational, scientific, and literary activities, Men who have -
, interests similar to Mr. Maksymiec's are found in various engineering fields,
of astronomy, scismology, “economics, psychology, and technical publ ications i
' writing. These Fields are closely allied to his present occupational endeavors,

On the Educational Interest Inventory, a device that is beneficial
to an individual in discovering-his interests in various fields of Study,
‘ . Mr. Maksymiec's responses indicated that his study interests are very high
; in physics; high in engineering, chemistry, earth science, and history and
political science; high average in communication, zoology, and mathematics;
and average in. psychology. The areas in which he showed low to average
interest were music, education, industrial arts, agriculture, botany,
sociology, literature, art, business administration, and economics, |

Name: Myres.law A. Maksymiee

Mr. Maksymice also took the Amy General Classification i
Edition, te find out his overall level of mental ability. Wis aled
that he exceeds approximately 74 percent of adults in seneral mental capacity .
as measured by this instrumént. A safer evaluation of his performance is
that he is probably in the upper 2S percent of adults regarding his global

intelligence,

On the Michigan Vocabulary Profile Test, an ‘instrument that attempts:
to measure a person's intellectual interests well as the amount of infor-
mation he.has retained in various areas of knowledge, “Mr. Maksymiee indicated,

“when compared with college freshmen, that he exceeds approximately 50 percent

in his hnowledge of humar relations, 69 pereent In government, and 67 percent
in the physical sciences. on the lower side, he does as well or better than
24 ‘percent “in his familiarity with commerce, 31 percent in mathematics, and

24 percent in Fine arts.

In order to find out Mr. Mauksymiec's ability to handle English, a
basic’ necessity for one to perform well in college, he was given the

Cooperative English Tests. When compared: to college freshmen, he showed that
he exeeeds from 52 percent to 78 percent in his understanding of vocabulary;

’ from S to 17 percent in-his ability to comprehend what he reads; from 2 to

1) percent in his speed of comprchension; and From 18 to 36 percent in his
overall ability to know and understand what he reads under timed conditions.
In his skill to express himself properly in English, he exceeds from 1 to

6 pereent of college freshmen. Who reading and expression are combined
into one score, it may be said that Mr. Maksymiec cxceeds from 6 to 12 per-
cent of college freshmen in his overall usage of Engiish.

The results of .the above tests indicate that Mr. Maksymiec has made
the most of his learning opportunities both within and outside the military
service, Although he completed only eight years of school, he has acquired
a ‘considerable amount of knowledge by observation, ruading, and personal
experience, In spite of his broad experiences and acquired knowledge, it: will
be necessary. for him to improve his reading and writing skills in English,
however, before he begins college courses. Although he manifests a high
interest in engineering and scientific -Fields, he should probably not con-
sider these fields as majors becuuse of his deficiency in mathenatics. gt
is believed the skills in English can be developed but it is doubtful if

: the mathematical defic tencies can’ be overcome sufficiently to major in a
seientific area. It is probably advisable, therefore, for Mr. Maksymiec to

consider one of the social sciences as a college major. His background in
photography and military subjects, combined with a college major in an ap-
Propriate social science, would’ probably provide him with the necessary
qualifications to become a geographer or an intelligence analyfst in govern-
ment service, . :

It. is understood that Mr. Maksymice has enrolled in Montogomery Junior
College, Takoma Park, Maryland, for the 1966 fall semester and that he will
take a special English course concentrating on the fundarentals of reading -

Name; Myrosliw A. Maksymiee

and written expression, After he completes this instruction, he might con-
sider working for an associate of arts degree in a social science at’ this
junior college with the ultimate goal of transferring later to a four-year
college to work toward a bachvlor degree. -

I have appreciated knowing and talking with Mr. Maksymice and I trust
he will contact this Bureau if he requires further counseling assistance,
My best wishes go with this report in whatever plans Mr. Maksymiec makes ~
concerning his future plans and goals. .
