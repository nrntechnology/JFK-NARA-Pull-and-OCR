MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of Troining Registrar

THROUGH t TO/ORD
SUBJECT : Evnluation of Contract Management Institute
: Course

1. I attended the Contract Mansgonent Institute on 28 to
31 March 1967. Immediately after that course I submitted ex-

‘tenaive comments to Mr, Arthur Leach, DD/S&T cnordinator for the

course, and Y understand that those comments were included in
the overall recoumendations for future changes.

2. Since three snd ono~half months have transpired since
conpletion of that course, details such as the names of speakers
und subject material are a bit havy but I will repeat my overall
reontion to it for whatever benefit it might afford. The course

material was good although 1t eould ‘have been oriented much more 1
coxers ||

toward ‘technical project managers rathér than administrativ
officers, to the ultimate bene?it of DD/SkT. Two of the speakers
wore excellent; howsver, the third, whe also waa apparently i
Director of the Institute wes very poor both with respect to hig |
understanding of tho material snd his presentation. Dr, Xennedy

of Notre Dame and the lawyer, whose name I do not racull, vere

excolient.

3. This waa primarily a asles piteh for CPIF contracts.
My pergonal impresnuien was that U.S. Government contracting agea-
cies hava just about completed the circle of 2 great procurement
finaaco, fn departing from fixed~prica and CPFF centracts to CPIP’s
with various avard arrangements, the ¢ontract negotiatarna were
unable.to really ever define ccst and ended up invariably in
giving away additional yoes te the ceatractors for nothing received.
Definitive costs were alwaya a function of experienced and sound

Course

technical investigation and management of a contrect and whea-
ever costs followed a nonlinear curve, most estimates becane
almost completely unpredictable. NASA and the DoD generally have,
therefore, gone from CPI¥ types to CPAF-type contracts; the CPAF
type ends up being simply another CPFF but.with the contractor
having the advantage in the establishment of an award fee and
with the Governnent having no recourse to redetermination. My
reaction was simply that the DoD experience simply reaffirms ny
own -- that for R&D there appears to be no good substitute for

a 'woll-managed CPFF-type arrangement.

the goals and missions of this Office,

The technological innovations established in his Division

Mr. Christ will bo retiring 29 November 1979, Prior to 1970

he hag generally been considered a capable officer and the list of
his accomplishments during his Agency career is not unimpressive.
Christ's performance, particularly in the last six months, however,
has vevealed critical weakness in judgment, discretion and self-

, evaluation. These flaws’ have heen cailed to Christ's attention by
"me personally, and I deem them sufficiently serious that were if not
for his proposed retirement I would he constrained to seck other

means to separate him from Agency employment.

During the past year Mr. Christ has attempted to consolidate the large

effort in positive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro+
technology, and emplacement, He continues to be conscientious, responsive, ,
and aggressive in the management and development of these technical progranis,
Further, during the past year giant strides have buen taken in the coordination |
of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers, Thiy coordination has
been above and beyond that required by existing Agency regulations.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must

be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the
forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction, On occasion
his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-acceleration
in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order, However,
his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in

. truly large steps forward in technical areas where the cost effectiveness cannot

. Considéring his geographical location for the previous three years, Mr, Christ.
has done a remarkable job in organizing the Radio-Physics effort and in developing a
new effort in Audio-Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the
Office, All of this required that he exercise considerable initiative and judgment in
the delegation of responsibility for existing projects and in the formulation and

Applied Physics Division, Office of Research and Development, be
granted a Quality Step Increase from GS-16, step 6, to GS-16, atep 7,

2, Mr. Christ entered on duty with the Agency on 16 Nevernber

increasing responsibilitica and has expertly implemented and fulfilled
the objectives for which his Division was formed in the carly growth
period ef the Office, Although he has performed equally as well, and
perhaps better than, many of his equivalent Division chiefs within the

a vaise other than the Legislative pay raises, :

3. Mr. Christ is considered to be a key individual in ORD,
His energy, initiative, and enthusizsm in developing concepts and
applying rnanageriul talents make his services to this Office :nvaluable,
