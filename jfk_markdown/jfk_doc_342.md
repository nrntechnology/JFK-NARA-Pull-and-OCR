MENORASDUM FOR : Deputy Chief, WH/7

+

REFERESCE : Your request this subject

Following our receipt of information that Clemard-
Joseph Charles bad taken 2 list of requirerents into
the U.S, Embassy in Port-au-Prince and asked help in
filling them, WH Division sent a memorandum on
19 August 1969 to the Chief, DCS, asking that DCS's
contact with Louis A. Brun (from whom Charles had
received the requirements) be terminated. :

ete inet «

The DCS New York office on 29 August 1969 sent a
memorandum to Chief, DCS, which reviewed the case, noted
Brun had been guilty of sloppy security, and concluded
that no further requirerents would be givea him. This
memorandum did not, however, say that contact would be
terminated; in fact, it s2id they would continue to de-
brief Brun whenever be returned from a trip to Haiti. i
This memorandum was .sent to Port-au-Prince (HTPW-1347,
17 Sept 1969).

The Station replied (Port-au-Prince 6496, 11 Oct 69)
that this was not enough, that the contact should be -
completely severed. WH/Branch 7 officers then met with
Mr. George Musulin of DCS to discuss the matter further, t
WH/7 officers maintaining that there was more political i

. Action hazard to this contact than the FI product ‘ t
justified. Musulin agreed to raise the matter with . H

- The result was a menorandum on 16 October 1969 i
from C/DCS to C/WHD which referred to the original WHD 1
memorandum of 19 August and advised that contact with : :
Brun has been terminated. Port-au-Prince was so informed -

(DIR 48277, 21 Oct 69).

was originally introduced.to ¥ODISH in Hew York City,
by Subject on 15 April 1966. Until the early f211 of
1967, much of WODISH activity with IDEN A was devoted .
to arranging contacts with various elements of LNHARP,
which IDEN A requested on tehalf of Subject, and
reporting operational information. To the best of
VODISH knowledge and belief, however, none of these
contscts produced any tangible assistance to Subject’s ~
5 various schenes. With two exceptions, WODISH

relationship with IDEN 4 since Octoter 1967 has been

exclusively that of foreign intelligence collection.

fhe exceptions were Subject's request for a secret

meeting vith a WOLADY envoy in Hay 1969, and an

independent similar request from another group in

the sawe month. As has been fully reported, IDEW A

sade it perfectly clear to HODISH and to Subject

and to the other group that he was acting only as

a channel and that he was not actively involved or

interested. We (WODISH) simply transmitted the

request. ¥e vish to point out that what: the Desk

calls IDEH‘s “"Lottying” for Subject ended before

Octoter 1967. During the nearly two years in

Which the contact in the WODISH New York Office

hag dealt with IDEN A, the latter has never sponsored

or "lobbied" for Subject's various schemes. IDEN A

bas occasionally relayed information concerning then,

bet hag told FYODISH repeatedly that he no longer :

_ wishes to be involved politically with Subject.

“c¢. We wish also to point out toat IDEN A, as a
regular supplier of foreign intelligence oo Heiti,
bas supplied data which originate with Baitians
other than Subject, and, therefore, IDEN A is not
gerely Subject'’s mouthpiece. Specifically, IDEN B
end ibon C are two of IDEN A’s Esitian scurces.

IDEN B is a well-known Haitian businessman; IDEN C
is 2a former deputy. | .

“a. We (WODISH) are not concerned vith Subject,
wat are very auch so rith IDEN 4. We do not helieve
that IDEN A is involved in any current revolutionary
Scherme im Haiti. We are, however, disturbed at the
unprofessiona! way in which IDEN A handled the questicas
concerning foreign companies in Haiti. We did not :
request IDEN A to consuit Subject about the requirenents
on foreign cospanies and, in view of the. aanner in
which IDEX A. handled our requirements, we shall
continue cnly to accept inforsation which he proffers
on his return froa his frequent trips to Haiti, and
shall refrain from briefing him. We have requested
our WOROMP customers to give us an evaluation of |
DEN A‘s intellizence reporting. Unless this evaluation ~ -

1. We have carefully considered WH/7's comments about
Louis A. Brun end his relationship with Clecard Joseph Charles.
have concluded that in the ratter of the nine questions concerning
the activity of foreign companies in Raiti Brun has been guilty at
least of sloppy security procedures and have decided to modify our

relationship with hin.

_. 2... Charles has never doubted that Brun represented a
channel to US goverment authority which he could use to suppiexent
his contacts with nenbers of the US Enbassy staff in Fort-au-Prime.

. Brun was originally in=reduced to DCS in lew Yorx City by Charles on
15 Apr 1966 (see menorandua SY-251-66). Until the early fali of 1967,
much of our ectivity with Brun was devoted to arranging contacts vith
verious elenents of the US goverment, waich Brun requested on Dexal?
of Charles, and reporting operational information. To the bes= ct
our knowledge and belief, however, none of these contacts preciced any
tangible assistance to Charies’s various schezes. :
our relationship with Brun since Cctober 1967 kes been exclusiveiy that -
of foreign intelligence coliecticn. The excestic=s were Charles‘ s

a US exvoy in Mey 1969 and en in-

Gepenéent siniler request from azcther group in the same month. As

Charies and to the other grcup that ne wes acting only as a chanel.

the requirements on foreign companies and in view of the manner in waich
Brun handled ovr requirements we shall contimue only to eccept informa-

Brun in the mammer just descrited. Insofar as contact between Brun

three political parties in the post-Duvalier period and is convinced
that TOP will win a constitutional victory at the polls and propel

hin to power. In the meantime, Colonel Kesner Blain will be the head

of the provisional government. Slain has no long-range political
ambitions. Charles and his colleagues plan a new constitution for -
Haiti, which will provide for a President and for a Prime Minister.

The Prime Minister will exercise the effective power. Charles expects
that TOP'’s electoral victory will make him, as TOP‘s leader, Prime
Minister in the new constitutional government. :

HEMORANDU FOR: Director, Domestic Contact Service 7 |
Louis A. Brun/Clerard Joseph Charles |

. 1. On 29 July 1969, Station Port au Prince advised

_ that Clesard Joseph Charles had passed 2 list of nine
questions concerning the Hzitian econoay to an official
of the United States Embassy in Port su Prince. The List .
‘of questions was vritten in English in staadard U.8.
Governzent format and, although sterile, sppeared to be
Antelligesce requirements. Charles told the Embassy
official that he had just firisbed a “big job” for the
Pentagon and implied that the list also cane from the
Pentagon. The Enbassy official suspected that Charles
bad passed a copy of the list to the Kational Palace.

2. On 2 August, a representative of the WH/Haitt
Desk contacted ur. George Husulin, Operational Support
_Btaii of DCS, and iearned that the IX<S ofgzice in Kev York
had briefed Hr. Louis A. Brun and had orally passed a 3
34st of CIRL requirements to Brun concerning Haiti prior : :
to his trip to Haiti during the week of 21 July. : J
Br. Masulin speculated that Brun had probably noted the , :
G&G requirements on paper and then had passed a copy
to Charles upon his arrival in Haiti.

3. For a number of years, the United States Govern- .
ment has been aware of the political anbitions of Chsrles : ;
and his alleged plotting to cverthrow tte Duvalier regime. .
In 1967, this rather open plotting led to his imprison- j
ment for over one year. Also, since May 1963, Charlies . ;
has been trying to obtain support from the United States :
Governnent for his plots but he has been consistently i
rebuffed. Charles is not held in bigh esteem by U.8. ‘
officials and his motives are highly questionable. He.
oves his position in Haiti to his relationship with :

the core notorious financial rackets of the regizne.
Charles enjoys no political folioving and even the *plois”
with which he is associated are viewed with considerable
reserve. Por example, we have never been able to confirn
that Charles was involved vith the “military junta” formed
in May 1569, as be claimed. In February 1963, the U.5.
Bmbessy in Port au Prince comaented that, vith regard to
the most recent plotting of Charles, “the possibility .
eannot be excluced that Charles....could be a provocation > :
to detormine the real motives of the United States Govern= } i
went towards the Duevalier regine.” We concur in the — a
Babassy's views. : i

i been tept advised of the contact between DCS «ad Brun and 4 :
i! his relationship with Charles. Ve sre aleo avare frou i
4 DCS and cther sources of the efforts by Brun to obtain

i support from the United States Government for Charles.

u Brun is, of course, a close collaborator of Charles and

u a business representative of his in New York City. Brun

H the Department of State, and even a person vith access to
i Presicent Johnsen on Charles* behalf. The Chief of

Brun’s involvement with Charles requires that he be con-

sidered a biased source of information. While sone of the
information Brun hes obtained fron Charles has been of .
interest, there is Lardly anything that sas not available
through other channels and indeed, much of it was slanted.

5S. As was set. forth in VH/7 nenoranda to the
Operatioaal Support Staff, DCS, on 16 July 1968 and
28 May 1969, we interpose no objection to DCS sainteining

REFERERCES: A. DIKECTOR 26288 dated 1 August 1969
B. HTPA-2443 dated 29 July 1969
ACTION REQUIRED: See Paragraph 5.

1. The Station would like to offer its views on
the WCDISG contact, through Identity of Paragrash 1
Reference A (hereinatter IDZN), with 201-357029, as well
as ca the question of the requirezents which 201-357029

LNPURE and which were forwarded to Headquarters in
Reference B. .

2. Since IDEN has been told that his contact is with
LSSHOE and since he has told 201-357029 that fact, and since
201-357029 has apparently, in his nind at Least,converted that
fact into contact with ZVROCK, and has probably spread both
stories with his associates and thereby throughout the ?ocal

milieu, we have, in effect, a dangerous security situation.
When we consider that the LNFUKZ receives all tne information

oe cchitniy prar ny Ta

that 201-357029 gives IDIN anyway, and most ot the time receives.
the information directly from 2U1-357029, then we have an
operation that is difticult to justity. .

3. In the case of the requirements forwarded with
Reference B, we have a situation in which WODISH levied
requirezents on 2U1-357629, through IDEN. 201-357029
then turned those requirements over to LNPURE which returned
them via 201-357029 and IDEN to WCDISH. Why not cut out the
giddieman and the security coazplications, and save the headaches?

: 4. The Station teels that the WCDISH handling of 201-357029
- results in a case that has the potential of causing eevere™ ‘
oblems for AKULE, and that it could well be that AKULZ will
Be made to bear the blame since elements within RVROCK might
