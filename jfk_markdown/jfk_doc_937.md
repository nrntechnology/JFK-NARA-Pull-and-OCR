(FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

Soviet Officials' Statements About NOSENKO

The portrait of NOSENKO which emerges from Soviet
efficials' statements about him since his detection coin-
cides markedly with NOSENKO's self-description. According
to the comments of Soviet officials, principally intelli-
gence officérs most likely to be speaking authoritatively,
defector NOSENKO was the son of the deceased ifinister, he
served over a decade in the KGB, his personal shortcomings
were overcome through the patronage of KGB General GRIBANOV,
and in connection with cperations against Americans he
occupied positions of progressively greater trust and
responsibility, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of the
largest department in the key Second (Counterintelligence)
Chief Directorate. According to these sources, his defection
wrought severe damage “for years to come" to tne KGB
because of his knowledge of KGB operations against American
targets, and his treachery prompted the expulsion and
disgrace of numerous senior KGB personnel, the recall of
Many others from abroad, the virtual suspension of KGB
operations in the United States, and extraordinary plans to
assassinate hin.

These statements are related in chronological order in
Annex A.

Baku), where he finished the Eighth Class in spring, 1943.
In a second version {more probable since entry to the Moscow
Special Naval School required prior completion of the
Seventh Class] NOSENKO- said that when the war broke out he
and his mother were evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he
completed the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned
to Moscow afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the
Moscow Special Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he
completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall of 1943
NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School (then in Baku).

After just six months in Baku, without completing the
Ninth Class, NOSENKO ran away from school and returned to
Moscow.

Comment: NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran
away and fought on the front at Tuapse, and
that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku
and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the
Frunze Higher Naval School, the equivalent of
Annapolis. He has retracted both assertions.

NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the
Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval
Preparatory School returned to Leningrad from Baku, he
resumed his studies there. Early in 1945, however, NOSENKO
received a gunshot wound in the hand, and after being
hospitalized for a month, he left the Naval school.

Comment: NOSENKO has claimed both that he was shot by

Comment: (Continued)
After NOSENKO's defection was publicized,
Sovjet Naval defector ARTAMONOV volunteered
to CIA that he had known the son of the
Minister NOSENKO in the naval school in
Leningrad from 1944 to 1946.

NOSENKO completed the Tenth Class at the Leningrad Ship-
building Tekhnikum in June 1945, and he successfully passed
the necessary examinations to qualify him for entrance to
the Moscow Institute of International Relations that summer.

Birth to 1945: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO is virtually the sole source of information on
his early life. However, this portion of his claimed
biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where-
abouts as publicized in press accounts at the time cf his
father's death in 1956, and with the existence of the
schools he claims to have attended.

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics
(fighting at the front, attending the Frunze Academy, and
formal induction in and discharge from the Navy), all of
which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's
claimed identity as the son of Minister Ivan I. NOSENKO
and the substance of his claims about his life until 1945
are accepted as true.

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute
course was of four years' duration and that he entered the
Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years'
duration and that because he failed a state examination he
was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'
duration and he graduated In 1950, on schedule; and that it
was of five years' duration but he failed an examination
which delayed his graduation for three months.

Comment: See p.367 for report that NOSENKO joined the KG&
—_ upon graduation from the Institute in 1947.
The duration of the Institute course and the
date Gf NOSENKO's completion are materiai to
the plausibility of his claimed Nava] RU service,
which he said followed almost immediately upon
his departure from the Institute.

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953)

NOSENKO claims that upon completion of his studies at
the Institute of International Relations he entered the
Naval RU, serving in the Far Fast and then in a Baltic post,
finally successfully "transferring" to the KGB through the

intervention of his father's friend, KGB General KOBULOV.

A sensitive source two

CR has quoted/KGB officers aaeess
respectively, as stating NOSENKO joined the KGB in 1947
or 1949,

THe significance of NOSENKO's.RU service is the fact
that he claims it launched his intelligence career and
served as the means through which he secured appointment
to the KGB after once having been rejected. The two or more
years he claimed to have served in the RU represent a
significant period of his adult life for which he should
have no difficulty accounting. Finally, the date of his
actual transfer from the Naval RU to the KGB is critical to
determining the time from which his claims about KGB service
can be judged credible.

NOSENKO volunteered extensive comment on his Naval RU
service at his first meetings with CIA in 1962. After his
1964 defection, it was the topic on which he made one of
his initial retractions and his first admission that he had
earlier made a false claim. The subject of his Ndval RU
service was consequently prominent in interrogations in
1964, 1965 and 1966. However, throughout these interrogations,
challenges of his assertions about his RU service prompted
adjustments in his claimed date of graduation from the
Institute or claimed date of entry into the KGB, just as
challenges on those latter topics prompted amended state-
ments with respect to his RU service. The extent of the
still-unreconciled discrepancies and contradictions in
NOSENKO's various accounts is best perceived in comparison
of his statements made in 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1966.

NOSENKO's Information-1962

NOSENKO finished the Institute of International Relations
in 1950 and immediately reported for duty with the RU.
{He did not amplify how he drew such an assignment.] In
September 1950 he was offered assignments in Leningrad,
Moscow, and in the Far East, and he chose the Far East "so
no one would think he would take advantage of his father's
position". He was assigned to a radio signals interception
unit in Sovetskaya Gavan' {on the Soviet coast opposite
Sakhalin), where he collected Order of Battle information by
monitoring the communications of American units operating in

>FRIPPEL was.a weak agent: "he was afraid and gave practi-
cally nothing." NOSENKO said that alliéugh he had recruited
him, “honestly speaking, FRIPPEL was not an agent." ‘The KGB

nevertheless hoped that FRIPPEL would be reassigned to Mos-
cow at some future date. (See p.137 for details of the
FRIPPEL case. }

he also met NOSENKO in Odessa in February 1962.

Johannes PREISFREUND

The KGB considered PREISFREUND compromised to American
Intelligence after GOLITSYN's defection (in December 1961] and
thus unsuitable for further use against Americans at the E£m-
bassy in Moscow. For this reason, NOSENKO was told to take
PREISFREUND with him when he transferred to the Seventh De-
partment. As the agent spoke only Finnishand Russian, however,
he was of no use against English-speaking tourists. NOSENKO
met with PREISFREUND on the latter's visits to Moscow in 1962,
but did not use him in any operations.

Comment: PREISFREUND asserts that he was no longer a KGB
agent after the STORSBERG operation (see p.175)
and that although he saw NOSENKO on his frequent
return visits to Moscow, it was only because
NOSENKO sought a companion for wenching and
drinking.

who was [erroneously] considered to be a CIA officer.
SHAKHOV “mavhe" had some contact with MARK in 1960 or 1%¢@1,
but NOSENKO did not know the substance of it. A counter-
intelligence officer of the First Chief Directorate, S.it.
GOLUBEV, had once been on a delegation with SHAKHOV and he
had noted “little details". While SHAKHOV was in the Lnited
States, earlier, he had been terminated [as an agent! by
KGB officers who had submitted a report stating that SHiAr
liked life in the Unites States, American products, anc
money. in that KGB report he was depicted as “not gocd”
and ‘not wanting to work as an agent".

NOSENKO stated that SHAKHOV had served with the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs in the United States and that during that
service he acted as an agent-recruiter for the KGB. SHAKHOV
was permitted to travel abroad even though suspected cf being
an American agent, because he belonged to the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, and "the KGB could do nothing about his
trips abroad". "There was no proof, only suspicions, and
furthermore, SHAKHOV was a member of the personal staff of
the head of the Soviet delegation, S.K. Tsarapkin." According
to NOSENKO, SHAKHOV was not and never had been a KGB officer.

Comment.: SHAKHOV has served in and visited the United
States since 1942, when he was assigned to the
Soviet Consulate General in New York. He at-
tended the 1945 Conference on International
Organization in San Francisco, and he had at-
tended a number of sessions of the UN General.
Assembly. Most recently SHAKHOV was assigned
to the U.S. in 1963 as a member of the Soviet
Mission to the UN. KGB officer RASTVOROY 1den-
tified him as an MVD [KGB] officer whom he 1s
certain he saw at MVD Headquarters in Moscow,

a sensitive sourc identified him as “an employee of the
KGB": and KGB defectors PETROV and DERYABIN
have reported that from a photograph, SHAKHOV's
face “was familiar". An FBI source, however,
in 1964 said that SHAKHOV was a “pure diplomat”
and that to his knowledge, SHAKHOV had engaged
in no Soviet intelligence activity until that
time.

NOSENKO described the various ways he had tested suspicions
of SHAKHOVY in Geneva. He gave SHAKHOV disinformation and then
watched for an indication that he passed it on to his American
contacts. SHAKHOV yas told to perform countersurveillance
tasks during a mecting by NOSENKO with an imaginary agent,
wnile otner KGB officers checked for signs that SHAKHOV had
forewarned the Americans about the meeting. Finally NOSENKC
revealed to SHAKHOV the location of a KGB dead drop and
checked five days later to see whether the specially prepay
materials empiaced had been disturbed in any way. NOSENKO's
conclusion was that SHAKHOV was absolutely free of suspicion,
and it was his intention to report this finding when he re-
turned to KGB Headquarters from Geneva.

comment: Currently in the United States, SHAKHOV is still
“under suspicion", according to @3RRR@P a sensitive

Security Escort Officer for Soviet Disarmament Belega*ion

NOSENKO said that he was the sole KGB officer with tne 94-
man Soviet delegation to the bisarmament Conference and as
such he was responsible for the security and behavior of ‘the
entire delegation. (KGB officers I.S. MAYOROV and M.S.
TSYMBAL came with the delegation to Geneva, but they had left
Geneva before NOSENKO made the foregoing statement to CIA.)
To assist him in carrying out his security functions, NOSENKO
had the services of a number of coopted informants of the KGS
who were serving in the delegation. [NOSENKO has never re-
ported what, if any, security checks he ran on the delegates
in his charge, or what, if any, information his informants
provided him. }

NOSENKO has never been precise about how he spent his days
and nights in Geneva, but he has indicated that he disposed
of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had little
to do. He explained in 1962 that he could come and go as he
pleased because Ambassador Zorim knew who he was, as did most
of the delegation. No one paid him any attention. It was
known that he was not really a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
officer, and ne could absent himself from conference meetings
at any time.

Yu.I. GUK

Implying that their friendship was of long standing,
NOSENKO related in i962 that he and GUK were together nearly
every day in Geneva,-where they went out to chat and have a
few drinks. As a canseyuence, NOSENKO was granted access tc
the residency and was able to elicit information about some
of GUK's operations in Geneva. He described his “big. big
friend" GUK as the Deputy Legal Rezident in Geneva and the
only “strong officer" in the residency.

Comment: In 1964 NOSENKO attributed his gaining access
to the residency in 1962 to TSYMBAL, not to
GUK. According to several sources (see Annex A’.
because of his friendship with NOSENKO, GUK was
dismissed from the KGB.

M.S. TSYMBAL

In 1962 NOSENKO reported TSYMBAL's presence in Geneva end
identified him as Chieé of the Lliegals Directorate of the
EGB First Chief Dirertwrate. He alluded to having spoken with
him, but placed no particular emphasis on their relationshis.

In 1964 NOSENKO claimed that he had been dealing with
TSYMBAL since 1960 or 1961, when he was looking for some
candidates for recruitment aud’ came across some whose baci-
gxound would have made them suitable for the Special [Lllega'ls.
Directorate. NOSENKO met TSYMBAL in Moscow in the KGB Head-
quarters and TSYMBAL had asked him several times to transfer
to the First Chief Directorate and suggested that ne might be
assigned to the United States. In Geneva, he and TSYMBAL had
dinner together several times a week, sometimes accompanied
by KISLOV and sometimes alone. It was TSYMBAL's influence,
NOSENKO said, which secured NOSENKO access to the residency
in 1962 and established the precedent from which he was
granted access in 1964.

NOSENKO's Information

SLESINGER came under suspicion by the KGB First
Chief Directorate because of his business transactions
with a number cf Soviets who visited his store and in
whom he seemed to show more than casual interest. The
First Chief Directorate was of the opinion that
SLESINGER was trying to become closely acquainted with
some Soviets, to study them. SLESINGER had visited the
Soviet Union several times. Learning SLESINGER planned
another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected that "he
might make some contacts or do something interesting"
while visiting the Soviet Union. The KGB wanted to
resolve its suspicions that SLESINGER was possibly an
agent or operational contact of the FBI. The KGB had
a file on SLESINGER, md a senior case officer in the
American Section of the Seventh Department, Yu. M.
DVORKIN, was the responsible case officer. An agent
of the Seventh Department who was director of a photo-
graphic shop in Moscow was instructed to become friendly
with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting the Soviet
Union, and the two men later exchanged correspondence.
SLESINGER went to Odessa to visit relatives, and DVORKIN.
directed’ the Odessa KGB to: "surround" him with agents. who
could watch his behavior. If there had been any indication
of intelligence activities, the KGB would have attempted
to recruit SLESINGER, but since no evidence was developed,
no approach was made. SLESINGER had travelled to the
Soviet Union before, several times.

A sensitive source
Comment: had reported to the
FBI that the KGB suspected SLESINGER to
be an FBI "plant" and that KGB officer
"might be trying to develop
SLESINGER to act as a courier or in some
other agent capacity."
NOSENKO's information was substantially
correct. Alfred Lazarevich SLESINGER,
.xeported to the FBI in July 1962 of his
June 1962 visit to Moscow and Odessa.
In Odessa SLESINGER was contacted by a
Soviet official who exhibited “intimate -
knowledge" of his business in New York
City and had asked whether SLESINGER had
“ever been bothered by the FBI."

NOSENKO's Information

SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian ex-
traction, a Russian speaker, and a university professor
in New York City. SHUBIN, who had visited the Soviet
Union twice before, visited the Soviet Union in 1958
or 1959, while NOSENKO was serving his first tour of
duty in the Seventh Department. At that time, SHUBIN
was the target of Seventh Department case officer
A.A. VETLITSKIY, NOSENKO heard later that SHUBIN was
placed under surveillance, and when the KGB surveillance
observed SHUBIN as a passenger in a ilinistry of Defense
automobile, the GRU was asked about the American. "They
very furtively said that they were interested in him,"
from which the KGB concluded that SHUBIN was a GRU agent.

In 1962 (sic) NOSENKO was reviewing a list of foreign
visitors to the Soviet Union and he noted SHUBIN's name
and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.
NOSENKO himself telephoned GRU General SOKOLOV's office
and informed SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according
to another version, SOKOLOV's office was advised by
others). SOKOLOV's office eventually apologized for
having failed earlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's
interest in SHUBIN.

Comment: Earlie : me identified a@

and FBI sources reported SHUBIN's travel
to the USSR in summer 1961 and in
September 1963.

SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport

between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited
the Soviet Union during that period it was
not as an American tourist under his true
name. Consequently, he could not then have
been the tourist target of the Seventh
Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed.
If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referring
to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a further
contradiction: NOSENKO could not have
noticed his name while reviewing tourist
lists in the Seventh. Department, because
he claims he was in the American Department
at the time. :

NOSENKG went to Gorkiy on the fourth day after CHFERE-
PANOV's disappearance. The area was covered with very deep
woods, “where a person could logs: himself for life". On the
seventh day CHEREPANOV was located and arrested in Baku,
where he was on his way to the Iranian border.

A special plane was immediately sent to Baku, carrying
S.M. FEDOSEYEV and several other American Department offi-
cers. They brought CHEREPANOV immediately back to Moscow,
interrogating him on the plane. He immediately confessed
to having given the documents to the Americans. When asked
why, he said he was “angry at the KGR, very angry", and
besides, he thought he might ask the Americans for some
money in return for the documents. He confessed that on
4 November he had passed the documents to an American tourist
who was a librarian interested in Russian books. He said he
had given the documents to the American in the entrance
hallway in the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
the building in which the Ministry of Foreign Trade was also
housed.

Because CHEREPANOV had eluded the KGB between the two
fixed surveillance posts which had been established, the
Second Chief Directorate suffered considerable criticism
for not putting CHEREPANOV under full, round-the-clock

that if he had detected his surveillants he would have

against "such an indignity, such persecution", and then
would have committed suicide, leaving the KGB without proof

The Recall Telegram
NOSENKO's Information

On 3 February 1964, NOSENKO claimed, he visited the KGB
Legal Residency once during the morning before he met with
CIA and again that evening after 1800; there were at those
times no KGB telegrams concerning him. On the morning of
4 February he again stopped in at the Residency, but there
were again no such messages for him. Later in the morning
of 4 February, however, after attending a session of the ~
Disarmament Conference, he returned to the Résidency and
found that a telegram from KGB Headquarters had arrived,
instructing him to return to Moscow immediately to partici-
pate in the KGB conference on tourism. After relating the
substance of the telegram, NOSENKO defected and was thence-

forth in CIA custody.

mSpecial Intelligence does not confirm NOSENKO's
assertion regarding the existence of the recall
telegram. According to Special Intelligence,
there were enciphered communications from Moscow
to the Soviet Mission in Geneva earlier and
later, but there was none from 1815 on 3
February until 1730 on 4 February, several hours
IOSEUKO was in custody of cia. }

NOSENKO's Eventual Retraction Regarding Recall Telegram

NOSENKO maintained throughout his interrogations
in 1964 and 1965 that there was the recall telegram and that
it prompted his defection. In October 1966, however, while
being questioned again, NOSENKO stated that there had been
no telegram recalling him to Moscow from Geneva, and he
signed the following statement:

"On 4 February 1964, I told my CIA contact
in Geneva that a telegram from Headquarters in
Moscow had been received in the KGB Residency in
Geneva recalling me immediately to Moscow. I said
at the time that this telegram said that I was
recalled to participate in a conference to plan KGB
activity against tourists for the 1964 season. I
maintained this story as fact throughout subsequent
interviews and interrogations by American authorities
in 1964 and 1965. No such telegram ever existed.

No telegram was received in Geneva. I admit that
the story was a lie. I myself invented this tele-
gram in order to hasten my defection. I was nervous
and afraid that my contacts with American Intelli-
gence might be noticed."

Knowledge of Other Seventh Department Operations

The notes NOSENKO brought to CIA in Geneva in 1°64
(see p.319) included brief reference to thirteen other KGB
operations conducted against what NOSENKO described as
tourists during the 1962-1963 period. For reasons cited
in the description of these operations in Annex B, these
operations are not. material to NOSENKO's claim to service
in 1962-1963 as cither Chief of the American-British
Commonwealth Section or as Devuty Chief of the Seventh
Department.

Operational Activities: = July 1962-January 1964: Summary

To substantiate his claims to having served as Deputy
Chief of the Seventh Department during this period, NOSENKO
describes KGB invalvement in the recruitment of
the arrests of [kOTEN and BARGHOORN, and the investigations
of SLESINGER, OSWALD,.and of former KGB officer CHEREPANOV,
his discovery that SHUBIN was a GRU agent, and his dasignment
to Geneva. Even if NOSENKO learned of the operations as ~
he described and they were as hé described (there are substan-
tial reasons why they might have been conducted by KGB
elements other than the Seventh Department), they are atypical
with respect to NOSENKO's own description of Seventh Depart-
ment operatiotis. They do not accurately charactérize, as
NOSENKO claims, KGB counterintelligence operations against
tourists, and thus do not substantiate his Seventh Department
service. -NOSENKO's explanations: for his assignment to
Geneva in 1964 are no more plausiblé than for his earlier
assignment there in 1962. NOSENKO has asserted that he was
not a lieutenant colonel as the teniporary duty authorization
indicated, but a captain, a rank incofgruous with a Deputy
Chief of Department and one from Which he presumably would
have been promoted as he assuried the senior KGB positions
which he clained to have a held. a ; :

several items of information he stated he obtained from
various KGB colleagues. According to these reports, GRIBANOV
was expelled from the KGB as a consequence of NOSENKO's
defection, it was rumored that GRIBANOV was to be fired
because he had been NOSUNKO's friend and patron, that
GRIBANOV was held responsible for the defection of his
protege, that GRIBANOV had approved NOSENKO's assignment to
Geneva in 1964 despite knowledge of facts making NOSENKO
ineligible, that GRIBANOV was a long-time friend of NOSENKO's
father, that NOSENKO had been a deputy to a Department Chief
despite his junior rank because of GRIBANOV's influence,
and that GRIBAHOV was dismissed from the KGB and Party
because he willfully withheld information about NOSENKO's
procuring women for parties which he and the General arranged.

NOSENKO's Information - Post 1964

Immediately following his defection NOSENKO continued to
refer to this special and personal relationship, which
touched on nearly every aspect of NOSENKO's KGB service.
Under interrogation, however, NOSENKO could not sustain
this claim. The extent NOSENKO's statements were retracted
or contradicted with respect to GRIBANOV or contradicted by
other evidence, is seen from the following examples excerpted
from the earlier chronological examination: GRIBANOV wrote
the very best fitness report on NOSENKO that could be given
(Retracted. GRIBANOV wrote none of NOSENKO's fitness
reports); NOSENKO and GRIBANOV carroused together with women
provided by NOSENKO (Retracted. NOSENKO recalled only two
occasions, and could relate only one in any detail.);
recruited Edward SMITH (see p. 3%) together with NOSENKO
(Retracted. NOSENKO played no active role in SMITH recruit-
ment attempt and was not in Embassy Section at time.);
NOSENKO accompanied GRIBANOV to diplomatic receptions in
1961 at which the latter learned that French Ambassador v
DeJean was GRIBANOV's agent (Retracted. NOSENKO accompanied

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in
successively senior positions of authority from which he
derived extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and
results of KGB operations against Americans in the Soviet
Union in the pericd 1953-1963. To substantiate his claim,
he provides an impressive array of information about KGB
personnel, organization and operations which, to the extent
that it has been confirmed, is presumptive evidence of his
bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including intelli-
gence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's
claims. According to some of these sources, NOSENKO was
a senior KGB officer wno occupied a series of sensitive
positions, who enjoyed considerable authority and trust
despite personal shortcomings, and whose defection, "the
greatest loss ever suffered by Soviet Intelligence"
paralyzed the work of

The examination has compared each element of NOSENKO's
biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known
facts and reasonable surmise. The examination reflects
the test to which his accounts were put: whether his
accounts are internally coherent and consistent with known
fact, and whether he actually gained the information he has
from occupying the KGB positions he claims to have held.

In short, is he what he says he is, according to his own
accounts?

22 June 1964 (eontinued)

the American Exbassy in the past, NOSENKO would also be

familiar with the number of microphones which had been
installed in the Embassy by the KGB and the locations of
these microphones. Third, as a Deputy Chief of a depart-

ment, NOSENKO would normally have had access to a telephone
directory listing all personnel in all directorates of the
XGB in Moscow. Another factor, which is a forridable one
in the minds cf other KGB employees, is that NOSENKO
travelled in a rather influential circle of. friends in
Moscow who were high in the Soviet Government. All these
commentsé were cited as reasons for NOSENKO being an
“important catch" for American Intelligence, but no one in
the KG& really knows exactly how much information NOSENKO
had concerning the KGB.

29 June 1964

* GOLITSYN (from personal acquaintance): NOSENKO, the son

of the former Minister of Shipbuilding, was a KGB officer

who had worked in the American Department and the Seventh
Department of the Second Chief Directorate. GOLITSYN, while
on his own First Chief Directorate business, met NOSENKO two
or three times in the American Embassy Section in 1953,

and had seen him occasionally at work during 1958 and 1959. .
When COLITSYN asked him where he was working in 1959, NOSENKO
replied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department.
NOSENKO served in the American Embaesy Section from 1953,

until 1957 or 1958, and was specifically responsible for

KGB coverage of American military personnel in Moscow during
1953. For the remainder of his service in the Embassy Section
until 1957 or 1958, NGSENKO may have had the same responsi-
bilities or may have been working against other Embassy
personnel or correspondents, but he was definitely in the
American Department during the entire period. In 1957 or

1958 NOSENKO was transferred to the Seventh Department, and
was a senior case officer there as of 1959. NOSENKO did not
work in the American Department of the Second Chief Directorate
American Department at any time during 1960; GOLITSYN visited
the Embassy Section on at least three cecasions from early
1960 to early 1961, and would have known if NOSENKO had been
in the Section, particularly {£ NOSENKO had been Deputy Chief.
C.1. GRYAZNOV was acting as assistant of the Chief of the
Section during this perilod.

): An investigating commission of the
CPSU Central Committee checking into the circumstances
surrounding NOSENKO's defection has thus far been responsible
for the expulsion from the KGB of 15 Second Chief Directorate
employees. Thess: include GRIBANOV, who was also expelled
from the CPSU and was stripped of his rank of lieutenant
general, GRIBANOV has been given a very small pension, like
an ordinary Soviet citizen. This drastic action was taken
since the primary responsibility for the defection was placed
on GRIBANOV. it was realized that, in addition to being Chief
of the Second Chief Directorate at the time of the defection,
GRILANOV was a personal friend of NOSENKO and had mere or -
less treated NOSENKO as a protege and had taken many steps
to further NOSENKO's career within the KGB... It was felt
that GRIBANOV should have been aware of .NOSENKO's plans to
defect. Three of GRIBANOV's, deputies were elso expelled
from the KGB, one of whom was a Major General BANNIK : ‘
[BANNIKOV]. Of the 11 other Second Chie€é Directorate employees
expelled, some were found to have been personal friends of
NOSENKO and some of them were found to have confided to NOSENKO
details of operations in which they were working. S. M. GOLUBEV,
a KGB officer stationed in Washington, would be leaving for 7
Moscow because the {nvestigating commission had determined
that Yu. I. CUK, a mutual friend of NOSENKO and GOLUBEV ‘told
NOSENKO that GOLUBEV bad been assigned to the Washington Legal

described one such party. Thereafter, TARABRIN was

itive afforded a hearing and was accusséed of willfully concealing \.

present. NOSENKO said he twice provided girls
for GRIBANOV and TARABRIN, once in October or
November 1963 in circumstances similar to those

"NOSENKG, about 30-38, an officer of the Soviet Secret Police
organization, defected to the USA without his family about
two years ago and asked for political asylum in the U.S.:
it was granted toa him. This was the most serious defeat of
the Soviet Security organs as NOSENKO occupied important
positions in espionage and counterespionage departments and
also was closely acquainted with the country's leading
families and homes. NOSENKO's family consists of a wife,
35, two daughters, 10 and 12, a mother and a younger brother.
The family is not prosecuted (sic) but feel very badly about
the incident [the defection}. Very soon the wife will apply
to the Luternational Lawyers Organization for a divorce and
compensation. It is possible that this case will be given
much publicity. tis wife has not heard from him since he
defected, but it is obvious that he is still in the USA."
