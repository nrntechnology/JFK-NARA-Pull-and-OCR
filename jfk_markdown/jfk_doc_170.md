“who knew SZULC personally and also had, informants in the Polish Embassy,
"3. | There is little doubt that SZULC.was pro-communist at the time,
_ and that he. co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed
, by the Press Section: of . the Polish Enbassy, and provided him with

"information", , It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conolusion
that: this collaboration took the fora of espionage, since SZULCs does

: a ean find no evidence that Tgnacy SACHS was an intelligence

officer, but he seems to have been an active propagandist, He returned

to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,
stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute
