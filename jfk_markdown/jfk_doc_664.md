peration ANTRUNK III/IV which was mounted in August 1963 was
Successful in that the two principals of the team, AMICE~27
oo and AMICE-14, were abls to contact aod to recruit two princi.
“"" "pal agents and several other action agents to lay the ground-
work fo> the MHAPRON objectives of the AMTRUNK Operation. One
of the two internal P/A's, AMTRUNK~9, was oxfiltrated with the
- | Zour-man ANTRUNK infiltration seam for training and operational
. discussions in the JMWAVE area. In early September, AMTRUNK-9
was re~infiltrated into PBRUMEN in Operation ANTRUXK Vv, the
. . Same Operation which exfiltrated AMFAUNAS ~1, -3, -13 and -34,
“ ° . In late October AMICE-27 was separated from the clandestine
wo part of the AMTRUNK operation. The original objectives of
Operation AMTRUNK VI, postponed from December 1963 to January
1964, were to revitalize and re-direct the efforts of the two
internal P/A’s toward their primary task, i.e. to spot and re=
- eruit among high level figures who are dissatisfied with the
Castro regime. In late December, the scope of this mission was
altered by the receipt of a commercial telegram in open code
* . 230m AMTRUNK-9 indicating that he was in grave danger and wished
* °° to bs exfiltrated. The twin Objectives of Operation AMTRUNK VI
. then became: first, to exfiltrate AMTRUNK-9 and, this accom-
“plished, for AMICE-14 to proceed to Havana for his task of ree
" channelling ANTRUNK-10's responsibilities. The exfiltration of
AKTRUNK-9, who brought with him his entire family consisting of
wife, brother-in-law, and three szall children, was accomplished
- on 9 January 1964. The unexpected presence of AMTRUNK-9's
family, couple? with reports of increased vigilance in the infil-
‘tration area, forced AMICE-14 to exfiltrate the same night with-
, out attempting to accomplish the second part of his mission.

A. To re-establish personal contact with AMTRUNK-10 and to
secure his full cooperation in spotting dissidents within
the higher levels of the military for the purpose of or- %
ganizing a cou.spiracy against Fidel Castro. : a

B.- To obtain from AMTRUNK~10 operational information on a
other MHAPRON recruitment targets. . oO

pilot for Fidel and Raul Castro and an influential figure -
in civilian and military aviation. :

D. Through the AMTRUNK ratline, to transport to Havana and

infiltrated AMTRUNK radio operator. At the same tine, to
ot explore with ANTRUNK-10 and other internal contacts the a
il. possibility of safehousing and supporting a radio operator «

rn is -. 4085 IV (23° 14° 00" N and 80° 47' 00" ¥, H. O. 2624).

The AMTRUNK IC will then proceed to the vicinity of coor-
- Ginates 133511, AMS 4085 III. . At this point, AMICE-14 and/or
. AMTRUNK-7 will make contact:with either Oscar DIAZ Jabiela-
. Garcia or his son Antonio DIAZ Torres in Casualidac
_ (17654795, AUS 4085 III). These two individuals are knowl-
edgable of the fact that the ANTRUNKs may return to the in-
filtration area although they do not know even the approxi-
mate date. Oscar DIAZ and his son Antonio are prepared to _
activate the ratline consisting of three different taxis, to Soo.

AMICE-14's primary task vis-a-vis AMTRUNK-10 is to cement
the recruitment of AMTRUNK-10 and to obtain his full coopera—

tion to work toward MHAPRON objectives. In addition, AMICE~14
will teach AMTRUNK-10 an OWVL system and leave a receiver with
AKTRUNK-10. AMICE-14 also intends to give ANTRUNE-i0 a review ©

4 short biographical sketch of SEMIDEY: oo

rig. Gen. Jose SEMIDEY, ex-Comptroller of the National » ~
rmy and veteran of the Spanish-American War. SEMIDEY
studied for one year at Purdue University, Indiana.
He and AMTRUNK-13 graduated from the second class of
ANACRA Pilot Training School in 1942. SEMIDEY flew for
Expreso Aereo Inter-Americano and Cuba Aeropostal for
_ about 11 years before he became Interventor or Adminis-
trator for tie latter company after the Revolution. After
Cuba Acropostal was absorbed into Cubana, SEMIDEY held
various positions of importance in Cubana. He also holds .
the rank of Captain in the Rebel Air Force and reportedly -
has made reconnaissance flights and black flights carrying
arns and/or agents to and from other Latin American
countries. SEMIDEY has a close friendship with Victor
.,. PINA Cardoso, the Director of Civil Aviation, and i6 ree
) portedly close to Raul CASTRO for whom he is a frequent —
personal pilot. Because of the close former friendship
: between ANTRUNK~13 and SEMIDEY and’ because of reports
sv. + $yom AMICE-14's family which indicate that SEMIDEY has
‘+ become disenchanted with the Castro regime, both AMTRUNK-13
-, and AMICE-14 consider SEMIDEY a prime candidate for re-
cruitment.

. Recognition signals will be established with AMTRUNK-7
and -16 and AMAGREE-1 who will be waiting with the IC
in the mangroves in the vicinity of the lagoon at coor-
dinates 129498, AMS 4085 III. . .

The scheduled date for the infiltration of the AMTRUNK tean
at the DRP is 2200 hours, 7 February 1964. The exfiltration
of the five team members with the AMTRUNK IC and rendezvous
with the mother, craft at the DRP is 2355 hours, 17 February,
with an alternate on 18 February. If exfiltration is not
successful on either of these dates, the radio operator will
be in contact with the base and contingent plans for exfil-
tration can be set up through this mediun.

AMTRUNK-16 is a 41-year-old single Cuban citizen who, as
a commercial fisherman, lived and worked in the infil/ .
exfil area all of his life. He participated in Operation
AMTRUNK VI in December 1963 and his up-to-date knowledge
of the infil/exfil areafrom which he fled in late October
