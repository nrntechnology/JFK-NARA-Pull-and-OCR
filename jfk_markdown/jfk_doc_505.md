Perhaps a relative's description of RUIZ

suns up his personality - "a man of many

as intelligent; ‘mentally alert, competent,
hardwerking, and respected by his subordinates.
Pleasant, easy going, nervous, quick-tempered,

of being insecure in his position... At times

reported to-be a member of DSE in 1946,

He expressed dissatisfaction with

He has said that many Cuban diplomats

seemed to him that the Cuban government -
wanted to keep him (RUIZ) out of the

tho “Common people,” and ia from Spanish parents,
.and-has done ao much for the country. I asked hin
what his goneral inpression vas of life there and
ho replied" pnenomenal,” and I believe he seant it.

: C. ‘Some cozments that Subjoct made vould appear
to be inspired by Cuban’ Propaganda or a briofing. He
Saiduthat. JKLANCE 18 in-control of U.8, internal
“... Security and im forciag-a rightest swing fo ite fa~
ternal politics. Also, all people going to Ciba
we ‘fFom Mexico aro ‘photographed by JKLANCE people, whi)
: fv you" go.from Spain you don't rum this risk, .

co 1 ‘ m 4f there was good potential: for
“Spanish companies ¢ sing busitices with Cuba. He replied
that Cuba ‘is: a bridge: to Latin. America, Thia -seened
a strangé ansver, and I pointed: out that you didn't
“have to. go-to ¢ © get to Latin Anerica, He said, ~
th 8: true, her countries will change to the
-Gubaa ‘system aad. wiil héed technicians to assist them. .
Then we (Iguess he seant Spanich buniness wen doing
business with Cuba) ‘will have excellent possibilities.

D.

B. "Subject said “that -he knew the Cuban Anbassador
to Spain and. in fact visited him this morning and re-
ceived a large box of Havana cigars from hin,

. ¥, “Subject 16 about 30 yearn old, good looking
and makes an excellent first impression, He appeara
to have a good business background in addition to being
4 trained lavyer, Ho seens uggregsive, determined and
has a good imagination for business ventures,

G, "It would be premature to say that Subject leans

toward Comuunism.or has been had by the Cuban I.s, J Oo
-doubt that be would have talied so freely about his
admiration for Cuba if he is working covortly for then.
It is quite certain that he is being used by the Cuban
Eubassy for cormercial purposes, and I would estimate
that he would eake an excellent “froat man” tor Cuban
business ventures. . i me

“ ' B. "Y would recouzend against. trying to recruit
Subject ag a means of getting to the Cuban Ambassador, .
He would probably turn down tho pitch and ioforn the
Cuban Eabassy." . : i .

. 2, The obove report isan excellent beginning in cur assess—-
_ Beat of Subject and HARRIOTT must be commended tor his adeptness
at steering the conversation toward the relevant areas of interest.
‘Ba think the report stands alone and requires little commentary by
the Station; however, ve night add here that there is a atrong
probability that Subject vas indeed ‘BNOwsd vader by the impact of
his alloged. three-hour “talk with “Castro, Given Castro's charjaca
and persuasive qualities it woul not be difficult to “convinces”

a young lawyer, alien to the Cuban environzent, of the progress in
Cuba, Rot. withstanding HARRIOTT's fine report we feel that Subject
ts still wallowing ito the ebullience of this confrontation wtth .
Fidel Castro. His short relationship vith the Cuban Fabassy and
one visit to Cuba vould hardly make nim an. authority on Cuba.

“fine reports ‘submittéd by Headquarters on AMAUTO-1. His. -

ceharieter,, personality, ‘physical“and mental: ‘capabilities,
and to somé extent even his vulnerabilities, are succinctly.
outlined: in: your reports. In addition, you have appropriately
recognized the Hurculean task we have, to overcome his, strong-
mindedness and idealistic character,

2. After a series of discussions among the officers
involved with PBRUMEN operations at. the Station, we have
concluded that to execute a logically developed "traditional"
recruitment, we are faced with the challenge to recruit a
person, an intermediary, in whom AMAUTO-1 has confidence and
respect; an individual who iS able to plausibly carry on a
polemic argument with AMAUTO-1 without cither antagonizing
him or causing him to become suspicious of the intermediary! s
true role, Moreover, the intermediary must be intelligent
to be able to respond in an appropriate way to our instructions,
as well as show a genuine willingness to cooperate. Frankly,
we have no such person, currently on our list of assets and
to find someone with the attributes set forth in Reference aA,
will be difficult to say the least, but we are prepared to !

work diligently on this problem, :

3.. AMAUTO-1 confides in few people. From our reading

of QUTINID and QUDOZE; there are at least three persons

“ who could Josicaldy and effectively fill the role as an
intermediary. They are Identities A, B, and C. We can
categorically eliminate Identity A for obvious reasons, i.e.,
lack of direct access to him. Because of his relationship
to Identit: we can also tentatively climinate Identity B.
He: presents a which” we are not certain should be taken;
however ,:we would like “to add a comment on him in a later
paragraph, - Identity C. would seem to be the most logical

young and. one. With whom AMAUTO-1 frequently talks and whom
he often-see We know little about his political proclivities
“although. ‘ne & S$ -the impression of being a moderate analyst
of world events and: doesn't: sec to have a Strong affection |
or aversion for the -PBRUMEN Government. We have.a good
background on hin prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet;
however, aS-you:can well, imagine, the report concentrates on

*. the. economic side of ithe individual... We have made a number
of- ‘attempts here in the .Embassy to determine whether he has
any American contacts, but with negative results. His visa
‘file does not show where he visited in the United States or
the purpose, except that it was a business trip. He has an

_ indefinite visa and we are fairly certain that, if necessary,
we could use the question of -his visa as an entre to him.

We are curreitly reviewing with all Station assets their
knowledge of Identity C. In addition, we are also considering
assets such"as QUCASH-1 and QUSPOT-1, who could, under some
‘legitimate buSiness pretext, contact Identity C. Our objective
is to.develop -a warm entree to Identity C without compromising
any of our agents, but we are in need of an assessment of
Identity C by either a Station Officer or an asset working
under an officer’s instructions. We will keep you advised of
our progress. We are forwarding PRQ Part I under separate
cover. <A POA on Identity C was requested separately. There
are no derogatory Station traces.

4. Identity B would be an excellent choice if not for
his relationship with Identity D. This avenue might be explored
with QUSEQUIN-48 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint
operation. QUSEQUIN-48 could probably get the necessary
clearances from Identity D directly, or from one of Identity D's
aides, to contact Identity B. We will not pursue this until
we receive your comments.

5. It'is not too early to consider the emoluments we
might want to offer to AMAUTO-1 at the time a pitch is made,
As always they’ should be divided into two areas - for defection
and for recruitment and work in place.

‘I. The PBRUMEN government has approved the construction’ = *- 4,
n Madrid of ‘a now office building to be used as an Enbassy,. : fe
omiercial office and résidence for the PBRUMEN Miniater,
he site has been identified and-work is expected to begin

‘sometime wit the.next two weeks, The builders expect. to
complete the: building within eight months. | . .

-{-|° § Reference: OSMA 24774 |. So , ae |

; c, . 2. QUSEQUIN-37 is far more confident than we are, about
a the possibility of getting access to the building during the.
‘| : “construction phase ‘to possibly install various audio devices,

i We believe this operation to be a formidable one and we might
i . be challenged by the presence in Madrid of PBRUMEN security i

forees overseeing the construction, the presence of PBRUIMEN .
electricians and other professions, Complicating the access !
to the building. Wo believe AMAUTO-1 has the Bomaniaon. |
experience well in mind and-most likely will do everything i
within his power to overcome the possibility of an audio !
penetration of his building. : : : :
: '

3. We would be grateful for any information addressees
‘aight have on the. general modus Operandi of PBRUMEN security
forces in areas where PBRUKEN official installations have been i
constructed. Have they used PBRUHEN technicians, electricians, Jt
construction engineers, etc? Also wa. would like to know whether i
the PBRUNENS have installed their own telephone system or have
they generally relied on the system of the host country, We
would appreciate too, any comments Headquarters or .

"other addressees would like to make on the best i
course of action for the Station to consider. QUSEQUIN-37
believes he can get a copy of the. blueprints sfter the plan ; H

SOURCE “Ai “official Spanish service from a usually reliable ‘source
. who was able to read the memorandum reported below.

1. In a memorandum dated 30 January 1970 to Carlos A. .
Nedra. Garcia, official of the Cuban Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Cuban charge d'affaires in Madrid
“Gnaslermo Ru iz’ Perez outlined the salient.current
problems of most concern to his mission; i
i
-.a, Building construction. Ruiz submitted
a proposal to Havana in December 1969 for-the
construction of a building to house all the mission
offices including the embassy, the consulate, the
commercial office, the Cubana Airlines office, and
possibly the minister's residence. Ruiz had not . : F
received a concrete reply to the proposal and he . :
urged Neira to take it up again with the ministry.
b. Radio facility: Responding to a request
from the Director of the Cuban National Fishing :
Institute, Emilio Aragones Navarro, in :
December 1969, Ruiz applied to the Spanish authori- :
ties for permission to install a radio facility.
in the Canary’ Islands for communicating with Cuban \
Ships. The permission had been granted by late .
December yet Havana had failed to follow up the
“project with’ plans and instructions,

‘between the Wife of the Cuban’ Charge in Madrid and a Miss
"Lourdes" speaking for the Grolior Company in New York, Bliss

|, Lourdes-said that her company was undertaking some type of
publicity and wished to interview the Charge in this regard,
Whén questioned about-what:kind of work the company does,
‘MisS“Lourdes replied that Grolier is an investigation (studies)

J and consultant ‘firm with. central office located in New York City.

Lourdes gave.her local number as 233-7448. She was advised
that ithe matter would ‘be brought up to the Charge, Guillermo
‘RUIZ, and she would be informed of the results later,

. 2. Later that day Aristides DIAZ Ruvirosa, the Enbassy's
.Press officer and:a member of the DGI, called back to say that
he would see her the next day in his office at 10:30,
EEE ere .

. 3. According to QUSFQUIN, telephone 233-7448 is registored
in the name of Isaac BENDAHAN Sananes at Calle General Moscardo 8,
6th floor,. Apt. C, Madrid: There are no Station or ltaison traces

on BENDAHAN.

Pte family in Cuba, as he lived in a solar Ll: in

: bo . Work as an.apprentice butcher for a Polish-
noe an : “American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a
uf Sate o grocery store on Flagler St. ta Miami. He
did'so well in attracting Latin-American customers
to the store that he soon began to distribute :
meat in: ‘the area for SAMKO.

oe ‘He has said that when he left Miami -

in 1958 he turned over to his brother a house
in North Miami, a brand new car, and over a.
thousand dollars in the bank, :

. EDUCATION : Aside from the statistics course:
taken in 1960, RUIZ seems to lack, in the eyes
of some cbservers,.a solid, formal. education,
‘But he makes up for it by being an avid reader _ :
(five newspapers a day, plus books). This impression, .
‘however, may be wrong, for there ‘are indications - ie
. that’ he either studied’or wanted to be a CPA,

_ He utiderstands and speaks English and
‘French (fluency unknown), and has undertaken .

fach grammar to the embasay staff. roe

. ‘Sensitive to art, or so he says, he

| frequently complains of the general lack of |
culture in.Cuba, His vocabulary evel is rather
low, cussing quite often in the présence of .
‘others...

RUIZ is well-versed in world affairs, .
and does have an understanding of international -
trade, co , ;

He has read some of the works of José Martf,

- whom"he likes to quote. But there is another :
book that he also refers to repeatedly, Kim PRILBY's
the KCB spy who penetrated MI-6,

: He is up-to-date on current intelligence
publications, .

HEALTH : Blond, baby-faced, and blue-eyed ("Very

handsome," according to Anita, the young maid ),

RUIZ is known to be suffering from an undisclosed
., liver illness for which he takes.a medicine called

“‘bilidis, Late in 1969 he was. planning to go'to .

- Portugal on vacdtion following the advice of his
physician, Dr. Pedro CABAS ( telephones, 276-7746,
256-2294 ), but he did not make the trip. He coughs
frequently, is used to cold weather, and was thinking
of going to the same gymnasium as his son Alejandro.

Cuba. Furthermore, in his view Havana is always
trying to interfere with the Embassy in Madrid,

than lack of organization there is chaos in Cuba
today,") - : .

.. He directs almost the same criticism against

But perhaps the most serious censure of
his activities came in by telex (" Why worry?
The Americans and the Spaniards intercept all
messages anyway") early in October 1969, Havana

_ questioned the way RUIZ was handling trade
negotiations with the Spanish Government, [The
trade agreement was extended by mutual consent
to 31 December 1972,

_: In his reply addressed to Radl LEON Torras,

_ first vicé-minister of MINCEX and senior Cuban
“official directly responsible for the talks,
Guillermo RUIZ defended his right to be "informed"
and "consulted" in rather strong language.
Therefore, he rejected that his cable number 521

- was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ, a Cuban trade-
official who had been the source of the complaint.

In the last paragraph he told Rail LEON
that the indemnification question ( payment to
Spanish citizens who owned property in Cuba)
depended on his reply to Den Pedro SALVADOR,

a Spanish Foreign Office official, and not on -
“bribery” conjectures, ;

friends that he feels very loriely in Spain ~

‘and“Has had the desire to simply ‘board a plane -
‘return: to. Cuba‘ abandoning the Embassy.

Late in January 1970 he.was again de-

pressed, for he felt like an "exile" ia

Spain after two years of service ( " Even
thoiigh LEON played a part ‘in my appointment
I cannot work ‘for a man that I do not under-
stand, Maybe. he sent me abroad to get me out
of the way. I feel as if I were in Miami,")

Re ‘thinks he is "burned" in Spain, and
when he returns to the Island he will definitely
not go back: to MINREX, but to MININT. He has
told close friends his term in Spain is up and
he will be returning to Cuba probably in the

‘summer. In any event, he does not plan to be in

Spain more than nine months. Nilda, his wife,
has stressed that they are ‘leaving Madrid permanently
in July 1970.

PERSONALITY + Guillermo RUIZ is an easy-going
‘rather simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige
and success that he has had in Spain. :

He has. a strong personality, undoubtedly |
the predominant pole in his marriage. He seems
to get along well with his wife.( " If anything _
should happen to me and my wife wants: to remain
“in Spain, Ijwant my children to go back to Cuba
to study, Then they can decide for themselves :
what they want to do, ") :

in his speech, for he always refers to Negroes,
‘as niches, a contemptuous Cuban expression.

SECURITY : It is normal for any member of the ;
ban Foreign Service to exercise certain discretion
in the area of security, but Guillermo RUIZ is
ST . particularly sensitive in this respect, which va
ted _- perhaps could be traced to his probable involvement “
an : with the DGI in one way or another.

- "He is’ quick to warn visiting Cubans of the
CIA's efforts (" La Companfa Sociedad Anénima" )
to compromise them, even. before leaving Havana.
"Our Embassy," he says, "is the primary target.
for U.S. operations in Spain."

He keeps control of mail going to and
‘ coming: from Havana in tae diplomatic pouch,
“ and states repeatedly that his office is
.. bugged and telephone tapped (" There are micro-
. Phones. here ‘the size of olives"), In addition,
he thinks he is followed openly by Seguridad,

For all these reasons he has acked Havana’
/ for funds to build a new embassy, where he plans’
‘to have a shielded room free from microphones, ( The
. .. building, which will cost approximately $600.000, .

Therefore, he will probably resist any

But this does not mean that he is unapproachable,

to its efficiency. It is then a question of
how and when,

The. wery fact that he has made open remarks

by ‘The 10~mi lien’ ton sugar harvest, which ~
_ is scheduled to end on 15 July 1970. -

RUIZ has indicated that he is. unhappy in -

- his post--perhaps not really meaning what he-

says--, which he has occupied for over two
years, . :

As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans
a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest,
he himself may be one of the targets, Assuming
that his ideological inconsistencies have been
noticed, the DGI, in the absence of proof
regarding his loyalty. and considering whatever
support he has in Havana, may request his
recall’ at an appropriate opportunity: during
a major reorganization of the Cuban Government,

Ia any event, RUIZ does not expect to
remain in Madrid much longer, and is planning
to be back in Havana by the 18th of July.

Te Cuba is successful in harvesting 10

million tons of sugar, and they have already

for mid-1970, and “he. might consider himself as a victim of ©

that purge.”

e. A fact ‘which might affect timing is the arrival of
a child in May. If he were to persuade his wife (and his
governsent)- to have the child in Spain, rather than return
home for it, he would have 2 good excuse for requesting the

that AHAUTO-1 is prcbably immine to this type of approach.
Headquarters, therefore, still opts for a logically developed,
"traditional" recruitment build-up.

. DOB: c. 1932
‘Cuban Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain,
. accredited 12 Decenber 1967,
_ CHRONOLOGY ;
“a. RUIZ probably comes from a huinble family in Cuba, decause
‘he Jived in a solar (semi-slum area) and began to work when he
‘was only fourteen years old. This circumstance suggests that he
lacks a formal education. Iie appears to come from a “revolutionary”
family (his father was identified as a Communist and a leader of
the_barbers’ uhion- in UfGA-13595, and a. brother. was identified

"as a member of the DSE ‘as of 1964 in UFGA-~]

‘2, In the fifties’ RUIZ emigrated to the United States,
traveling throughout the cast coast and holding, minor jobs,

. 1957. he began to work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-
American named Alexander SANKO, who had a grocery store on
Flagler Street in Miami. He cvidently did so well in attracting
Latin American customers that he soon began to distribute meat in
the areca, working for SANKO (RUIZ seems to be somewhat preud
of this success). He also appears proud of the fact that when
he left Miami in February 1958, he left his brothcr (same brother?)
a@ house in North Miami, a brand new car, and over $1,000 in the

bank.

In

3, Although he did well in the meat Lusiness, he traces a
large part of his success to another acquaintance in Miami: an
American of Cuban. descent known as Joe LOUIS (or LUIS). Joe
LUIS was_an_ underworld figure who was at that time competing
with the Italians in the bolita (numbers) racket in Tampa, RUIZ
and MOLEON (fnu), anothey Cuhan exile, were each offered $800
a month by ‘LUIS to supervise bolita collections in Miami, (There
is no specific indication that RUIZ took his bolita friend up on

this offer). Furtheriore, LUIS went _so far as Co offer RUIZ and
MOLEON $5,000 apiece to kil] a man named FERNANDEZ (fnu), who was

also involvcd in the bolita racket in Miani.

4. In February 1957 (note the 1958 date, above; perhaps
an error.on RUIZ' part) RUIZ left Miami along with a man nared
VILLEGAS (whose first name might be Harry) and three other
members of the 26th of July Movement, They entered Cuba clandes-
tincly. ‘When the revolution triumphed in Cuba, Alexander SAMKO
went to Havana, where he stayed for a week as RUIZ' house guest.
“: GAMKO offered RUIZ a partnéyrship in the meat business in Miami
‘if he would return. RUIZ rejected the offer, saying that the
Revolution needed him.

and QUDUZE has hin appointed about that. tine as chief of. the

trade school at MINCEX, a post he held for two years. In 1967

he was appointed charge d'affaires in Madrid vice Francisco Ramon

CALZADILLA.

. ON. THE JOB :

7. There secms littic doubt that RUIZ excercise the full
authority that presumably he should have as Minister Pleni-
potentiary. The relations between Cuba and Spain appear to
remain static because of Spain's refusal to appoint a full
Ambassador to Cuba after LOJENDIO was expelled from the islam
by CASTRO in 1959. RUIZ is involved in and is kept informed
‘on all matters related to Cuban-Spanish relations, including

trade. He docs not seem to peruwit commercial attaches to bypass _

him when they, submit reports to their respective. home offices in
Havana. In addition, RUIZ takes a keen and active interest in
Cubana operations, and he has said that no one may travel to
Havana on Iberia without his permission. He insists that Cuban
officials arriving in Madrid consult with him before arranging
“visits to Spanish officials or factorics. .He seems to have
good working relations with Spanish government officials,
because he is always careful to “put all his cards on the table"
in meetings with them, (The tenor of his conversation seems to
emphasize that he likes things this way in all his relations, »
personal as well as professional).

8. Little appears concerning RUIZ’ unofficial contacts
with other diplexats in Madrid, except that he is close to and
exchanges information with the Alecrian Ambassador. (Accord-
ing to current records, this is Ahmed LAIDI, posted to Madrid
on 15 December 1966, living at Calle Tiemblo 3, Ciudad Puerto
de Fierro, Latest desk traces show this person as born 20 April
1934 in Oudja, Horocco, aud as of 25 October 1966 to have dbecn

consulting with Havana,

he makes 90% of the decisions without
explaining that: "this is the reason I am here."

: 10, Above all, RUIZ directs constant and bitter criticisa
against Havana, because of what he terms the ‘incompetence there.
In his opinion, this generalized incompetence’ will. cause CASTRO
to carry out a. major purge aftcr the 1970 harvest ig in. (He
specifically repeats that "no one in Havana wants to make any
sort of decision"). One of his favorite books is The Peter
Principle, to which he refers constantly, and .he uses this
pook to describe what is going on.in Ilavana, iIn RUIZ' view,
Havana-is always trying to interfere with the Embassy in
Madrid, a situation which results in a lack of, coordination
and cooperation. RUIZ directs the same criticism against his
staff in Madrid, because his personnel lack qualifications for
the jobs they hold. . He once told an associate: "They think
that I'm a fool, but I don't miss anything they do.”

JJ. In turn, he has also been the target of criticism

from Havana, first from Zoila COMEZ (2), who made a critical evalu-
ation of the Embass. RUIZ' reaction is instructive: ‘I decided
not to answer it. I took a librium, smoked a cigar, and forgot
all about it." On another occasion he complained to Aristides

regarding his program for the Embassy. Havana was complaining
that not much had becn achicved. RUIZ noted that the Embassy

to answer that particular criticism itt detail.

SECURITY AND SECURITY-CONSCIOUSNESS

15. RUIZ seems te be particularly sensitive in the area
of security-consciousness... This attitude can possibly be traces
to an involvement with the DGI in one way or another, but his
background and especisily his political views (see below).
would appear to argue sgainst his affiliation. RUIZ is quick to
arn visiting Cubans inst the efforts of what he terms "la
conpania, sociedad an ato compromise them, even before _

they Tcave Havana, indicating RUIZ' possible belief: in the

omnipresence and power of the sociedad anonima., He censors mail
going to and coming fron Havana, and he repeatedly states that
his office is bugged, s telephone is tapped, and that he is
followed quite openly e€rever he goes. He attibutes this
surveillance to the ridad, and he probably ascribes it to
the Spanish. (Note Th despite his “knowledge" that his words
go to hostile surveillsace, he still dares to express critical

opinions openly).

. 16, This securitr-consciousness is apparently the big

reason he has asked Havana for funds for a new Embassy building,
where he plans to have a shiclded room free from bugs He. intends
to have Havana send electricians for the job and Cubaa personnel
to act as doormen, etc., with the wives of the latter to be his.
char force. He scems fanatic on the subject of not having any
Spanish personnel in the building. (Note that one Sr. VILLARROYA,
of Constructiones Aznar in Madrid, _is handling the real estate

operation). - . . : : ;

° 47. RUIZ is particularly. aware of what he calls "traps."
He once recalled that he had been asked to dinner by the wife
of a VIP and, after accepting the invitation, was told that a
priest would also attend. Ne did not attend the dinner,
although it considerably upset his hostess, because he was
afraid of a scandal arresced by the police. He said that he
receives only in the > because through that. door can

enter only those whom

ies

14-00000

18. Neverthe] » RUIZ has several times mentioned that | -
he holds his really portant conversations at hone, .and that he
would rather sce more people at his home instead of at his .
office, (Iu this connection, it is noted that the house ‘next .
door to his ~-= Calle Triana 44 -+- which used to. be a hone for .
the aged) fs now enpty. The owner of the apartment building . oe
where he lives is Ignacic ARTERO, a Spaniard, eee - :

. 19. RUIZ has even suggested installing a radio transmitter
and speaking in code with Havana, The Cubans are in fact
_installing a transmitter on the Canary Islands, but RUIZ, -
ceharactcristically keeping: his actions correct, has stressed
to the Spanish that Cuba will not use the transmitter for other
“than legitimate commercial purposes. RUIZ even offercd -to-allow
Spanish citizens to operate’ the station in order to enphasize
his point. : . ,

20. Correct as he generally is in his professional we
behavior, RUIZ made what appears to be a mistake in discussing —
with members of his staff the possibility of telling Havana that
a Spanish foreign service officer scheduled for duty there (Juan
TORROBA Gomez, cf. OSMA-25692) might be open for recruitment, “If
one ‘recalls RUIZ' constant warnings that. his office is bugeed by
Seguridad, the discussion about TORROBA clearly exposes him to

action by the Spanish authorities.

21, RUIZ himself is the target of what appears to be
control by Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemus (201-733544) who is:
“allegedly the First Secretary in charge of cultural affairs
but who secms to be the "security man" in the Enbassy. (We
note that CURBELO's photograph was shown to ANBEDEW-1, who did
not recognize the likeness). RUIZ has complained at least once
that he needs a'“yeal" cultural attache. CURBELO has instructed |
the front-desk girl to pass on to him a summary of who sees whom
at the Embassy and for what purpose, including RUIZ' visitors.
(Given RUIZ' near-mania for running his own shop, CURBELO must
indeed exert an ,acknowledged security control).

' . 22, Despite security considerations, however, RUIZ appears
addicted to taking automobile jaunts by himself to the interior
of the country. He must have very powerful reasons to do so, for he.
is probably cxposing himsclf to attack by Cuban exiles. Given the
reception accorded to Carlos ALFARAS, Armando HART, and Carlos
CHAIN at the Barajas airport in June 1968, RUIZ might be
unnecessarily exposing himself. He has not told anyone of
where he gocs or’ what he does, and both his. wife and CURBELO
strongly disapprove of his custom. .

. . FAMILY

23. RUIZ' wife is Nilda VECIANA, who was reported on in
; UFGA-1900G, She,is probably in her carly thirties. She is
pregnant and due: to have her fifth (7) child carly in May 1970.

26. RUIZ' children are:

a. -Guillermito. He is the oldest and ig now 4
studying in Havana. Thore were reports that he was 4
unhappy there, and RUIZ asked on 16 October 1969 to.go
to Navana to settle a personal problem with Guillermito, i
If there were a problem, it seems to have been solved,
because RUIZ on his return quoted Guillermito as being a
very happy in his new school. (Some time ago, Mrs. Hector . ,
GALLO Portieles was constantly ncedling the other women
about not being “revolutionary” enough and took Nilda_

RUIZ totask for having her children with her instead of

to join them, before the older one returned to school.
RUIZ once told 2 visitor that Guillermito had been

left with his grandparents during their cxile “in Miami
and had been very resentful of it, so they had been
very careful cver since not to repeat that mistake).

b. Alejandro. He is about six years old. <Accord-
ing to those who know hin, he is the real devil of the

‘Yessons, goes te Colegio Fstilo, and swims at Cimnasio
Mascardo, Pilar de Zaragoza 99, (Nilda has talked to

swimming or exercise),

. 27. Al) four children arc very spoiled and have caused .
Several maids to Yenve their jobs. Severina itterly complains
thay the children snow no respect for their parents, and that is
the reason Sever-na gives for her hate for Nilda. ”

EDUCATION A* ND CULTURE

- 28. Aside. fron the two-year statistics course taken in
1960, RUIZ. appears to lack a solid, formal education, although
he makes up for it by being an avid reader (five newspapers a.
day plus books). Ne understands and speaks English and French
(fluency unknown) and has undertaken to teach grammar (presumably |

Spanish) to the Embassy: staff.

29. RUIZ appears to be sensitive to art, and he- frequently
. . complains about the general lack of culture in Cuba. (This.
~ , . might indicate thatRUIZ considers himself “above" the Revolution).
: . He shows some of the general inconsistencies of the ‘self{f-cducated,
For example, his vocabulary level is rather low, and he curses
frequently when talking to other male members of the staff. On
the other hand, he scems rather well versed.in international
affairs and has a good understanding of international trade. It
is probable that he has read some of the works of José Marti and,
although he dictates letters to his secretary, he types some of

his own reports to Havana.

HEALTH PROBLENS

30. RUIZ suffers from what his wife has described as a liver t
-dliness (not further specified) for which he takes a medicine

called bilidis, (This may refer simply to the medical words for

"liver disease" Competent. experts here guess that the medicine

is used for anything from chronic constipation to gassiness

and constant eructation because of inadequate digestion of fatty

foods. It is possible that RUIZ suffers from the hard- to-pin-down

mal de foie, which can be found in a high-strung, hard- -driving

person. Ruiz" evident use of librium (sce above) might also

suggest this condition).

3). Late in 1969 RUIZ was planning to go to Portugal to
rest, following the recommendation of his physician Dr. CAVAS (also
received as CABAS and CALDAS), and whose telephone number appears
to be 276-77-46. There is alse a mention of: a Dr. PERIU, but his
relationship is indistinct. RUIZ coughs frequently, is used to
cold weather, and was planning to go for his health to the same
Gimnasio as his son, Alejandro. :

32, A July 1968 mamorandum for the record stated that RUIZ
suffers from a spinal ailment resulting from a fall he had about
12’ years.ago. Since then he has had chronic backaches which were
particularly severe during the time that he was in the U.S.
- Haiti, and Santo Dominge. His pains have recurred since he’ : . r
arrived in. Spain, On 3 June 1968S he had a severe attack and was

00000

treated by the “s Spanish doctor VILLALANDA (rnu), who,
prescribed cortiso: lis condition was. diagnosed as incurable,
since it was doubted that’ the injury to his spine could be :
corrected by-an operation, RUIZ was further told that, the
condition. would continue to grow worse, and that within six to
ten years he would have a defective walk. RUIZ planned to send

‘the diagnosis and X-rays to ROA in Havana, who would pass them to

the Cuban specialist MARTINUZ-PAZ for review.

TRAVELS oe, re

33.. Following are the trips RUIZ - is known to- have made during

the 1 last quarter of 1969:-

- “a. To Bilboa, San Sebastian, and Burgos by car,
_on 28 November 1969, returning two days later.

; b. To Havana, to settle “a personal problem," on
20 October 1969 via "Yberia (first elass), returning to
Madrid on 29 October.

c. To London on 14 November for consultations with
Raul LEON Torres, returning two days later by air,

. d. To Italy with his family on vacation on 28 December
‘to pick’ up an Alfa Romero that he bought for the Embassy,
returning by car and arriving in Madrid on 6 January 1970.

CONTACTS IN MADRID

34, Little is known about RUIZ' contacts in Madrid. Aside.
from the Algerian Ambassador (see above), we know about: ; 2

a. Pedro RUIZ. A good friend who goes to RUIZ'
home frequently. According to RUIZ, Pedro is quite
influcntial and is a friend of MASSO(?).

—

b. Carlos CARRASCO, " Another person who calls
RUIZ frequently. In late October or early November 1969 -
CARRASCO went to New York, :

a c. Rosendo ‘CANTO (201-749310) . CANTO lives at Goya
54, Madrid. Wis friendship with RUIZ is interesting, given
CANTO'’s background, because their being together could be “
- very dangerous for RUIZ «unless he were using CANTO for
some reason with the approval of Havana. CANTO wants to go
to Havana for a year, live there for a year, and then join. the
Cuban Foreign Service. Referring to CANTO's desire, RUIZ
said on & January 1970: "He is.a fool!

CHARACTER . SG

35. Superficially, RUIZ scems to be an easy-going and rather
simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige and pusition he has
and the successes he has had professionally in Spain. He appears
to have a strong character and probably plays the predominant
role in his marriage. He and his wife scem to get along very well

way

rene. Oa the other hand,
encies in his public
aks like aman at war

together nad they are not heard to
there apy to be very decp ine
and private behavior, Some tines: he
with himself.

. 36. A certain degree of racisn can be detected. in his
constant. refe ence to blacks: as iches," 2 disrespectful
Cuban colloauialisn roughly comparabYe with the pejorative

word, "nigger."

. 37. RUIZ almost never discusses women with his -colleagues,
_ except for one off moment, when he mentioned a girl he knew .
in the United States:before. the Revolution. Perhaps RUIZ wisely
remembers that Nilda ‘also works at the Embassy and refrains
‘from mentioning women 6n her account. In any case, he is not

_ known.to be involved in any extramarital affair. (Still, one

- wonders about the custom of absenting himself by automobile
‘into the interior of Spain). uo

'38, His habits seem to be simple: he likes movies; he
has read Topaz (but made no comment thercon); and he receives

- people at his home for cocktails.

- POLITICAL AND. IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS

. 39. Although outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ gives much
more the appearance of a man with moderate political views
struggling to justify to himself the actions of his government,
especially in view of the political and cconomic realities of
his country. It is. possible that his feclings might lie

closer to the theory of the "betrayed revolution” ---but not _
for strictly ideological reasons. The incompetence of the
Cuban governzental bureaucracy, for example, has sabotaged the

revolution,

40. In the first place, RUIZ definitely does not scem
to be a Marxist and consequently he cannot accept the role of
"robot" (lis term) required by Party discipline and vertical
structure, : :

.. a. On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telesforo
DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX cfficinl: "Revolutionaries
‘should not be coerced by forms of political control.”

b. On 1] December 1969 he told a visiting
Agropecuario official from Havana that: " ... if I
disagree with orders, I question them because I am
not a robot nor do I have the mentality of one. As
@ human being I express opinions no matter what the
risk that I may have to accept personally."

ce. RUIZ s :
_to what he thinks - BS otd 20g
_ they may-be on the opposite s 3
from him, He once mentioned w he weat out of his way
* on the street because they had been
- The Cuban ‘exile evidently Curned away
. from him, but RUIZ defendéd his own action in initiating
the greeting.’ : :

* 41. Aside from the constant criticism of Havana's incompe-
tence, lack of vision, ‘and lack of realism, he is quick to point |
out the-dcficiencics of. life in Cuba as reflected in his directive
to his. Embassy staff not to celebrate Christmas together, because

“there ave hungry pcople. at home, RUIZ has also said that medicine

in general is quite backward in Cuba,

-: 42. Although he is probably an athfbst (or likes to think
of himself as one), he ‘ts Known to believe that "religion. should

“not be considered a handicap for persons. trying to return to Cuba."
-He docs not hide his-.views of the American people, cither, for
he describes Americans as "frank" and "simple". "They treated

me very.well," he told Raul LEON Torres in December 1969. On the
other hand, he refers to Latin American diplomats as bootlickers
because they use the. English language at parties, and he has
remarked that "capitalism -is no good,"

43, We seems to have a certain admiration for General

‘Francisco FRANCO, of whom RUIZ has said: "FRANCO is the only

reason that Spain is not Communist." RUIZ also called FRANCO
"one of the few most brilliant politicians of all time." These
seem like strange words for a man as security-conscious as he,

. 44, He appears to be well-informed on international matters.
Some of his views are contradictory at times, but they characterize
him as what might, be called an undecided realist: :

a. "Cuba is a political power, not a military or
economic power." . .

b. “The USSR has neutralized US sea power in the
Mediterranean," De

‘es. "Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever it chooses ~‘
to do so, although the base has lost its strategic value

to the United States.” :

dad. “US-China rapproachment should be feared, but
also a Japan-China alliance."

e. "US power is beginning to crumble, but the
Soviets are revisionists.” ‘

f. "The Egyptians harm us when they buy sugar from
Cuba and then resell to other countries,”

i

for two xcasons: -first fron ‘the nilitary

&. "We have to be'om the side of the Sovicts
and cconomle ©
point of view; secondly, because, whether right or -
wrong, they are on the same side fighting those who |

hk. "Cuba has had and now has major discrepancies
with the USSR, China, atid the US, but we.are on the .
side of Communism because we are against capitalism,"

Jovakian situation: .

- .. The Soviet ecceupation of Czechoslovakia: has’ been . ; .
a disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet’ action : '
would mean taking sides with the Azericans. A friend
may be criticized in private bat publicly be should be

side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons.
and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the

discrepancies with the Soviet Unioa, China, and the United
States but weighing the differences Cuba is with Coamunisa

.in Havana, I would like to tell you the following:
Firstly, Senor Joaquin AUVI’ Casals was.of interest to -
D. Pedro SALVADOR de Vicente; but because of the bad
record and activities of this’ man, it was understood
that his ‘departure would be denied....J.talked to Pedro
SALVADOR about this matter and upon mentioning this

man’s background he told me that his interest was due

to a phone call he had received from a friend of his in-
Miami. He considers that, given the background in this 1.
case, his friend was supposedly an instrument of "other :
interests". Secondly, regarding the other Spaniards,
oo we have no objection whatsoever to their departing the

i “source An official Spanish service from a source described as
: . sensitive and ‘usually.:reliable.

1. On 23 September 1969. the Cuban Minister to Spain,
Guillermo Ru iz’ Perez, called on Pedro S a lvador ts
de Vicente, the Special Delegate for Latin ‘American Affairs

’ Tn the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to discuss the -
_fortheoming tradé negotiations in Cuba . During the discussion
Salvador told Ruiz that the one and only question which con-

- cerns ‘the Spanish Government is ‘that of Cuban indemnifications
and pensions for Spanish employees, and he asked Ruiz what the
latter could say regarding this probiem. (Field Comment: The

’ indemnifications refer to property owned by Spanish nationals
which was confiscated by the Cuban Government,) Ruiz claimed . ‘:
that he had no. instructions on what he could say, adding that , ‘
. . the claims were numerous and that the paperwork involved was
Lo difficult and required a great deal of time. :

2. Salvador told Ruiz that the subject of indemnifica-
tions and pensions must be discussed during the forthcoming
negotiations, and that the Cuban Government must provide at .
least an approximate “figure.of what it is going to pay. He ‘
said that the indemnification figure must be based on the. en
value of the expropriated properties, less the amount of any © oO
taxes levied om ‘the properties. (Source Comment: Salvador co .
did not say what would happen if the Cuban Government failed L
to reach some agreement on the question but he implied that
negotiations would be delayed uatil the Spanish Foreign Lo .
Ministry received the ‘Cuban Government's reply to this oy
question.) (Field Comment: Since the conversation between . . 4
Salvador and Ruiz was held before the recent change of the ‘
Spanish Cabinet’ and: other. Government positions, there is no

_ The following comments ‘of ANAUTO<1 reflect Cuban thoughts
on the Czechoslovaquian situation, internal Spanish politics,
“and the effects of recent. changes “in the Spanish Government =
ont mpending ‘trade. negotiations between Spain and ‘Cuba. *

defended. (QULOZE, 19 ‘November.,). The Cubans have to

side -with the Soviets for military and economic reasons

and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the

Same ‘ideological camp. Cuba had and still has enormous

discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and’ the a
‘United States but weighing the differences Cuba is with

Communism as opposed to Capitalism. (QUDOZF, 3 November.) f

b. AMAUTO-1 was asked by his government to report . 7
on the new Spanish Government which Havana calls "Opus :
Dei". Toa visiting Cuban official he admitted that
he was at a loss to understand Spanish politics but
attempted to define them. It is not true that the
Spanish Government is in the hands of the Opus Dei.

There are’ some men in the government who lean. toward the
‘Opus Dei but there are others of a very different leaning
because they come trom the Falangist ranks, These men
(the Falang ists) may g0 along with the Opus Dei line
“because they allow themselves to be "carried by the tide”
but they are not of the Opus’ Dei. (QUDOZE, 19 November.)

Se. Concerning the inipending trade negotiations
with Spain, ‘in addition to the economic problem the
Cubans are now faced with another. impediment which
‘further delays the negotiations: the recent changes
odin the Spanish goverament. | It-4s difficult at this
‘time for the’ Cubans to approach any ‘Spanish official
because ‘of the climate of confusion among them. Most
Spanish officials have no idea.as to whether. they will
remain’ in-their posts or will be replaced. Therefore,
‘it is’ futile for the Cubans to press them for action ©
on the negotiations. The. most they can do is wait
patiently ‘until the situation is normalized. If the
negotiations are: not. ‘held within the 30-day expiration
_. period of the agreement, it iS possible that the present.
. Agreement. can be extended. for two months. This would
be advantageous to the Cubans because during the first
two months of. the year they. will be ablé ‘to acquire all
:the goods they will ‘need for 1970. (QUDOZE,, 1 ag * November) «

‘was actually that ‘of advisor on.consular matters but he exercised
po authority. The idea of helping him in his work is apt and
could be carried to the point where some officer like himself

(of similar category) could intimidate him in such a way that
‘Bis weakness Of character ahd susceptibility to outside influence
vould serve our purposes. There is no doubt that an attack
against Sr. Torroba in the way of making his task more difficult
would bring as an immediate result a greater influence on the
part of those who are interested in having him become a (word

even in the event that his work shculd not prove to be the best,
that another officer could be substituted that (word or words

"In order to. resolve the question of handling from this
Bubassy the departure of tho (word indistinct), please clarify
the reason why there hays been.a miSinterpretation, &verything
to the problems of Spain and Ciba through this Babassy will, of

translate accuvately and possibly more rapidly, they wenld
appreciate receiving seme original tapes iit addition to the trans~
cripts on 2 trial basis. Then when parts of the transcripts are
not understandable to the translater he would have readily avall-
able reference for replay.

‘Headquarters maintains its high interest in AMAUTO-1..

ng-range, in-place recruitment target. Much of this

 Anterest is kept alive by the excellent operational reporting
done... by Station Madrid:-over the past year, of which references -

| @ and D hereto are good examples

. '-8. Subject's position and total personality recommend
hin. to us as a high-potential target. He is strongly intel-
‘ lectual and emotionally committed to an ideal. At the sane
“tine, be exhibts certain vulnerabilities which could. be

- exploited.: We believe, however, that AHAUTO-1 could be
“approached only. in a.classic sense: a rationally devaloped,
long-range recruitment culminating in what would be essen-
tially an intellectual and even ideological pitch. This
course of action would take time and assets, but ve think

he would be eminently worth it.

3. First, his access not only is good now but seems |
destined to improve, Secondly, if he were our agent, he
has the wit and the acuity to know what we want and submit
information accurately based on requirements. Lastly, he is
a@ streng personality who could be counted on to move flexibly
but effectively within the target milieu.
