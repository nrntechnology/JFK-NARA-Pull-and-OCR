HEHXRAEDUM TOs PLAES
SUBJECT: Project HUVANOID

} Project HUVANOID {6 the most important single project of the San Jose

. Station, and the baais for ail existing ami contemplated 0S0 activities

: in the area. It is rejuested that the restrictions imposed uson project

mo HUVASOID, as contained in TRS-"-635, copy attached, be lifted at this time,
and the Chief of Station be authorized to direct the activities of HUMANOID
into the following channels.

: (a) Direct and close supervision of HUMAHOID-3, the Station's.
} penetration of the Vanzuardia Popular, Costa Rican Communist Party,
. in order to utilize fully the agente potentialities. HUMANOID.3
i ig intelligent, has a wide knowledze of Commist activities, plans
° po api personalities and is desirous of cooperatin: to the extent a his
fo ability. After a thorough de-briefing of WUAHOIL-3 by HUMANOID,
in order to ac uaint hin, HUMANOID~3 with the Station's apecific
interests and requirements, plus the subse yent close supervision waich
. Mill be exercised by HUMAHOID, and the continuing close cupervision of cee
: BUMAHOID-3 by EUMAHOID, it is felt that the etation will then bo in poo
r oa & position to provide intensive and ada:uate coveraze of tha objectives { f°
i @ssigned to it in the San Jose SOL. - . . . Po

Ro (b). Direct and close supervision of HUMAHOID-k, the Steticats
m , _ ‘penetration of the Yonen's Pronts affiliated vith the Vencvard‘a

: Popular. It is felt that the former cut-out HUCKLSBORS, who handled
BUYANOID-4 until 1 June 1949, was somewhat inept in his operational
dealings, which possibly may account for what seers to be @ lack of
Productivity in the HUHANOID-4 Project. HUNAHCID-4 hes an intinate .
relationship vith active CP members’ in Costa Rica, both on a low ani
digh leval, and possesses a definite potential Zor both ‘nidepenicnt
reporting, and for spottins a likely individual to be used.as a
Parallel to the HUMANOID-3 project. HUMANOID, who vill nov handle
‘HUKANOID-4, is capa>le of directing this agents efforts into the
proper channels, and ‘capitalizing fully on’ the talents possessed by
the individual. It te felt that this is enother instance vhereby
EUFAHOID, by vorking closely end directly with the inifyidveai can sake
& substantial contribution to the efforts of the San Jose Station.

: (ec) Direct and close supervisi{on of HUFANOID-1 ani BUMANOID-2,

Office in San Jose. Thy information that HUFAKOID-1 has access to”

@ very satisfactory type of azent. He displays a certain acount

of initiative in voluntarily performin: tasks not specifically
Tewuested by the Chief of Station through the cut-out EUKMOID.
BUMAHOID-2 hes deronstrated the qualities of villincness, discretion, .
and cooperatian.

(4) As to the principal avent of Project HUMANOID, the
following observations ere subnitted, vhich will indicate
unmistaxcably the value of this project, end its contribution
to the successful activities of tho San Jose Station.

» Evaluation of services - As the principal azent
and station cut-out, HUMAHOID ts cherged with the direction
and cuidance of HUMAROID-ls; HUMAKOID-2; HUMAROID-33
BUMAHOID-h, Hic handling of these agents is carried out in
@ professional an¢ efficient canner, and his personal comssnts

end corrections on their reports, based on hie long acquaintance ©

with local percumal!tica and conditions, are of considerable
value. Hia attitude remains enthusiastic and willing.

Evaluation of information - The information produced
by the agents being handled by HUMANOID is of great value
to the station. In addition to his ow production, this .
agents operations are vell suited to checking on information
received from other sources.

y COMMENTS - Despite the fect that HUVANOID has becn working umer
certain operational restrictions far a mmber of months, his value to the
station cont:mues to be of major importance. In addition to the tangible
and measureeble information produced by and through hin, EUMABOID has
Proved to be the single nost valuable source of background and orientation
data for the Chief of Station. His knowledge of the history of Cesta
Rican commmist activities and personalities, and hia crasp of the various
revolutionary movements and-fizures has been freely shared vith the

Chief of Station. These “briefing meetings” represent an intangible —
contribution to the over-all porformance of the Station. HUMANOID ts.
eager to expand his operations and upon the removal of present operatianal
restrictions it is believed that he can be given further responsibilities,
particularly in the recruiting of adiitional sub-azents. The station is
presently interested {n accomplishing a parallel penetration of the .
Coceamist Party of Costa Rica, in expanding routine investigative coverage
end in developing additional sources on political movements. It ‘s

‘believed thst HUMANOID can insure the success of these new ventures.

1. TaSW-685, which advises thet the expiration date of. a
this_project—has—been-cetermined-to be 29 February 1952, was :
received several days after the forwarding of TRSA-1056, which- | 5
recommended that subject be considered for czureer agent’ stctus. Al-
though TRSA-1056 furnished certain of the data requested by head-
quarters, the following additional information, queries and comments
oredect forth with a view So facilitating a final evaluation of the
projecte : . : a

0 2. Pursuant to the approval contained in TRSW-655,
dated June 29, 1951, HUMARCID has been and is currently acting as oo
cutout for HUMANIST-2, as well as for HUMANKIND-1 and KUKANKIND-3.  _ oan
It 4a therefore not clear whether pararraph 2.b. of TRSA-4G85 is to be ae .
interpreted as a new restriction on his activities which is to be placed . ,
into effect at this time. In other words, is headquarters’ approval :
of the suggestions contained in TRSA-950 now withdrawn? SO ,

3. As discussed in TRSA-950, assistance was extended

HUMANOID in setting up a photography and photocopy shop on the fringe
of the downtown area. Funds formerly used for rental of a safehouse
were applied instead as rental for his photo shop, with the purpose oe
of providing a safe meeting place between HUMANOID and HUMANIST-2 and.
to provide a more accessible spot for the processing of KUMAI!NKIND oi
material. Farly in July 1951, after two or three weeks experience
with photostating HUMANKIND material at the. studio demonstrated the
unsuitability of the arrangement, HUMANOID resumed his plotostatic
work in his own home. Tre studio has continued to serve as a meeting
-. Place for HUMANIST-2. fie following considerations entered into the

. decision to discontinue processing HUMANKIND-1 and 3 material at the
photo studio: 1). The conspicuous nature of the equipment in'a scall
shop; 2) the security risks caused by the prezence in the studio of ~
HUMANOID's local employee; and 3) the lack of any secure storage ;
“space for comprozising material o

FROM “Paul P. Paxton
SUBJECT: HUMANOID; Career Status

1. I do not feel that this man's position in the political
and social life in Costa Rica lends itself to our need for a
career agent in that area, His financial position negates hia -
accessibility to high-level information, and our reazirements
for Costa Rica should not be satisfied through outright subsidi- '
zation of an agent in order to place him in a position of influ-
ence. His wife's knowledize of his work for us is lamentable and
her Costa Rican background with substantial local political ties

our part for increasing his knowledge of our operations, Admit-
tedly, he has performed a Satisfactory service for the San Jose
station, tut his efforts are not so vital that his termination, in
the event he decides to sever connecticns with us because of -his
failure to achieve more prandent status, wold be a permanent blow
to our effectiveness there, * With respect to his knowledge of
future possibilities with 4S, we cannot be held responsible for

for a 6C-day wisit. He would then like to travel to the
United Stites hirnself in late December for a trief visit .

. with his parents in Illinois. This would be his firet visit

authorities at the cert of entry into the United Stetes May cemand a
$500.CO U.S. bond in substantiation of her intent to return to Costa
Rica after the 60 days. This station 1s therefore consicering
advancing subject U.S. $500.00 in orter to enable him to present the
bond if it is demanded and to obviate the possibility of tis spending
. everal hundred collars in travel money for his wife to a port of :
"entry end return to Costa Rica if entry were denied. This money .
would not be used by subject for any other purpose anc would be re-
turned to staticn funds after successful entry of his wife into the. .
United Stetes. |

&. In view of the fact that this Station has no basis
for comparison with regard to possible salary firures which might be
offered subject if ccreer arent status is approved, no recommendation
in this rerard is being made. However, it is pointed cut that subject
has worked for the orranization for almost four years, thet his
efficiency has been excellent, his rrasp of intelligence requirezents |
above average, his potential attractive, and that his rresent position

RANDUM FOR MR. THARP:

SUBJECT:~a>"“HUMANOID—

b&. Technical Surveillance in Costa Rica

HUMANOID is an American agent used as a cut-out in several
San Jose operations. He was employed in the technical surveillance on
the home of Juan Bosch, as one of the two monitors. He also handles
the photography incident to the HUMANKIND project, which work. he _
_ __.... performs_in his own quarters: (This may now be pérformed away from
: his home, bet until very recently it was done at home. )

‘HUMANOID's PHS shows the following points which Dave Wright

(see TZP-A-365, Part I)

1. His wife is related, through her mother, to the family of
CALDERON. This might be a connection with the "Calederonistas" who
are alleged to be the group of Costa Ricans responsible for mysterious
bombings early this year.

setae sen eee nee

2. Subject's mother-in-law,

who resides with him, is described

_as follows; “strongly inclined to Sr.

Calderon GUARDIA and Leo CORTES

during their respective regimes in Costa Rica, and she is now (Oct 1948)
enthusiastic about the Junta Government of Jose FIGUERES. However,
she takes no active Part in politics."

3. Other friends and associates of his wife are: Sr. and Sra. -
Miguel Corrales (San Juan Tibas Costa Rica). Miguel Corrales was a
radio operator and intelligence operative for Jose. FIGUERES during the
Costa Rican Civil War in the spring of 1948. .
7 Jose FIGUERES and Juan BOSCH were the target personalities
- of the technical surveillance. FIGUERES made the statement that “one of
his boys told him all about the surveillance."

From the above circumstances, it appears possible that HUMANOID’s
intelligence activities are probably known to either his wife, his mother-in-
law, or his friend, CORRALES, and that one of the three could have been
the source through which ‘the surveillance was blown. Would you discuss
this informally with Dave Wright, please? 7 :

Reference is rade to TRSA95O and Tisw-655
wherein subject's operations,as planned by this
station and approved by headquarters, were set
out. These operations have continued as
outlined without incident or danger to the
security of this agent or this station.

' QTHFR FACTORS:

- Subject is devoting increasingly more time to-
the coverage of mail intercepts, their photo--
stating, and enlarging coverage of seme. The
intelligence conscicusness as well as the trust
he has built up in HKumanist-2 in reporting on
top level Communist ectivities hes teken tire
and has produced food results in effective .
coverage. In view of his importance to this
station, his ability and his willingness to
devote time to the work when needed, it is |

“. recommended. that. subject be considered fora

will enable subject to devote a sufficient
anount of time to this work without being

. 1. Inquiry made of Humanist regarding the statements Sot |
. he made before the police during his interrogation reflects that ™ ;
he reportedly refused to testify before the police but made his
i. deposition before the Procurador as to his part in the technical 7 i
|) * installation which implicated only the writer, and this only after
Roo he wes told that Roddy had been identified. Humanist's testimony, as : :
well as the line of questioning to which he was submitted, revealed . ,
é the authorities! concern and their efforts to ascertain whether he
f had been engaged in or knew of any other similar installations on : |
: any other people. This he denied and maintained that the only !
instzllation was on Juan BOSCH. Humanist claims he made no mention
‘of Humanoid, and he believes the police know nothing about hin.

7 : 2.. Humanist's claims also tally with the account of
ho his confession as given writer by Manuel VE'TURA, Presidential aide.
bo Humanoid has been on the alert and has noted nothing of a suspicious : i
4 nature which. would indicate his activities being under observation : !
or investigation. This matter. of suspending his operations, as. a t
suggested by headquarters, was discussed by writer with Elio R.
‘Langtry during his recent visit in San José and the following”
suggestions are made for headquarters’ consideration:

. a. Humanoid at the present time is acting as cutout and
ehief agent for Humanist-2, Humankind-1, and Humankind-}3. There
is no other agent at the present time to whom these contacts can
‘be given. It is believed that if these subagents ere allowed a
.. 6=months vacation, they will become practically worthless when i
’ picked up again and have to work for the money they have been i
receiving, aside from losing interim information and developments.

oe .b. In an effort to establish a more secure, as well as a
‘2¢ comercial, cover for Humanoid, tunis office has acceded to

’ Humanoid's desire to set up a photography ana photocopy shop in
the downtown area, and has encouraged him in it by allowing funds

paid-for-—reéntal=of=a~safehouse_to—be=apo: ed-instead—as rental -
_ for his photo shop. This provides Humanoid with a good cover in

i . a business which he iz enthusiastic about and is a more natural
Place for Humanist-2 to make unobserved contacts. It also | i
supplies Humanoid with a more accessible Spot and efficient means 5
to photostat mail intercepts and return them to the post office. i
in tine instead of com.uting back and forth from his home in :
the suburbs of San José.

|

I

'C. Therefore, it is sugzested that Humanoid's semi-weekly
| contacts with Humanist-2, instead of being cancelled, be changed
to a weekly letterdrop, and a live contact once a month to take
! care of salary payments and briefing: This letterdrop can be

| effected by Humanist-2 passing by the photo shop at night and

1 “t dropping his messages through the slot in the door usually used
I . for after-hours delivery of films to be developed. The film
I

|

i

drop will be into a padlocked box, accessible only to Humanoid.

d. Regarding Humanoid's contacts with Humankind-1 and
Humankind-3, these are conducted in a thoroughly safe manner.
Mail extracted from postal channels by them is deposited in an
envelope and placed in a post office box. It is checked daily
by Humanoid, and if anything is there, it is removed, photostated,
and returned by him the same day. If anyone is noticed hanging
around the post office boxes, Humanoid does not go near the box
and returns later when the way is clear.

e. Another factor has erisen since the last dispatch which
has made this post office overation more secure in that the
Director of the Post Office is now beholden to Humanoid. Ina
recent legal squabble noted in the press which was raised by a

‘local Comunist complaining about the government confiscating
his mail from abroad, the government cesired to prove that this

*. mail was Comcunist propacanda which they had a right to confiscate, |
and the President therefore requested the Director of the Post™ .
Office to furnish sazples to prove this point. ‘With this "heat"?
on him,,the Director made a frantic appeal to Humanoid, who was
able to procure these samples for him, which satisfied the
President, and for which the ‘Director was truly frateful.
Therefore, no trouble is expected. from this intercept operation

_ 48 long as the present personnel are being used, and ample warning

+ will be given Humanoid in advance of any change in the present

attitude.

FDP and with ur. Johnston of your office, the following nodi fications
and additional data concerning. this project are set forth, - ~~

2. On 8 Mareh 1951 a technical surveillance was installed on the
residence of Juan 3OSCH, a Caribbean revolutionary leader, utilizing the
services of a telephone ccxpany employee, Yarcos Aurelius Salazar,
throush HUMANIST. HUNANOID and ITUMANIST. carried on the nonitoring in
shifts, but at separated intervals. ‘Shortly thereafter, 1it-wags noticed
that sone natives living nearby wore unduly interested in th: activities - |
of ‘the nonitorin: house, and; at the sare tine, mysterious bocb exulesions ; 4

i

were occurring in San Jove, HUMANISI learned that the police had received

‘ "a report that unimow persons were spying on the airfield, which adjoined

~ ; : . the monitoring post, and periaps were manufacturing the bombs. The aut |
3 veillance was discontimed and the equipment moved on 20 March. !

_ ~ 3. It was deemed necessary to brief Salesar on a possible investi- nn

gation and provide him with a suitable cover story, It is believed that 4 i”

Salazar becane frishtened, went to the police, and implicated HUJANIST, ,

\ who was subsequently arrested. After three days, HUMANIST confessed and
implicated the chief of station.

. 4. Tha chief of station, through his strong personal comsctions. ©
‘with the Viee President and other high officials, was able to convince
the President this activity was not detrimental to the interests of
--.* + Cesta Rica and the whole affair was quashed. HUMANIST was released fron
“... "Jail and the ehief of station contimes to enjoy cordial and amicable —
relations with the Costa Rican officials concerned. :

S. It is planned that the chief of station will be transferred in
'. the near future, at which tine IUYAIST will be terainated on the pretext
that all operations are baing discontimed. The only other current.
operation which HMANIST knows anything about is HUANLST <2, whom he was
dnstrunental in reeruiting in July 1919. He has had nothin: to do with
HUAANIST=-2 since then and has never knom who handles hin or even if he
