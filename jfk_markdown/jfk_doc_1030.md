Q Now, was this a special group within the NDO or was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

that -- when Harvey left, §

Wey Fitzgerald took over, it becane Special Activities Staff.

Q And Task Force W was created immediately after the

i A Well, not immediately. I think sometime around --
in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

- Q And that subsequently became the Special Activities

A Special Activities Staff and consequently became the

Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went

jj back into the Western Hemisphere Division.

A No. Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing-

MR. MANFREDI: On the record.
BY MR. MANFREDI:
Q Mr. Sturbitts, are you familiar with a gentleman by
the name of Frank Sturgis?
A Indeed.
G Is your familiarity based on what you have read in
the press?
A No. It is what is contained in the files.
Q Have you caused a search to be made of CIA files,

particularly the files of the Western Hemisphere Division,
in an attempt to determine whether Mr. Sturgis ever had any

connection with the Agency?

A I have.

(0) What were the results of that search?

A Absolutely no connection, never has been.

Q When we talk about connection, are we talking about

an employment relationship?
A That is what I am sneaking of.
Q Was Mr.Sturgis ever an independent contractor of

the Agency?

A No.
Q Was he ever a contract employee?
A No.
‘
Q Was he ever a regular employee of the Agency?
A No.

How did you learn of those operations?
Through the newspaper. And through FBI reports. 1
@ Now, are these recent FBI reports?

29 i A I don't see how. Frank Sturgis is a soldier of
‘i :

BY MR. MANFREDI:
Q Have you caused the Agency records with respect to nicl,
~ . ‘
Sturgis to be assembled in any one location? :
A Yes. Ihave custody of them.
i
Q And what is the volume of that material?
i
A As I recall, there are five volumes. Your Committee
1
i

called for them the other day after the article in the paper,
I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and

they returned them Monday afternoon.

Q Do you know who examined those files?
A No, I don't. :
!
a: . , |
Q You indicated a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD office in Miami with some frequency, is that correct? ;

A Well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information. ‘

Q Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

A Recently it has been.

Q Has Mr. Sturgis been encouraged by the DCD office
in Miami? . |

A Mr. Sturgis has been told by the DCD office in Miami

to take his information to the Drug Enforcement Agency or the

FBI. |

Hy A No manner.

nD

Q Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to

Lon

| collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A I can't speak to that but the records that we have

2

| @ontt reflect anything like that. Before they would contact

‘ 8 somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file
iH .
. 9 i on Sturgis, they- would have to coordinate with the Latin

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because
the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our
own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped

it in through thicd countries in Europe. It did hit the target.

The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the
automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a coliplete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because
Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going
extend the credit.

The railroad system was in total disaster. The
Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus
the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment
because they were used to good American equipment. And these
were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

Q In your experience at the Agency can you think of

A What did you have in mind specifically? You mean the

Puerto Rican thing?

A Well, that is one of the things I had in mind.

Would you describe that for me?

A Well, this is, I guess you could term it a target of
opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban sugar
to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to
it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the
1
drydock or wherever it was, they had to remove the sugar and
|

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody cane |

a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the
individual, and some of this was done. And then when it
leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

firm buy it back from the Soviets.

Q Yes.

A No. Not that I recall. You see, Cuba really -~ in

those days the only thing, Cuba was exporting sugar and nickel.
The agriculture sector of the economy was in absolutely total

chaos. God, they didn't have any citrus, they didn't have

anything, and the poor people in Cuba were literally starving.
i
There just wasn't anything to eat. And Fidel was going around

with this big plan -- of course, there were a number of

experimental cattle ranches in Cuba. King Ranch had one there.

I forget -- several other European and American companies that
had experimental cattle ranches there and they were experiment-|

Fidel was preoccupied with this. He went up to

Canada, and paid $100,000 for a bull and -- so he just put it

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined '

that obviously she was receiving messages and she was

sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillan->

‘on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and

indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found

it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was oen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved
in. .

Q Were there many activities of that type?

A, Not really. You have got to remember that the
Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a larie
squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty reda-
tive, This was one of the reasons that obviously fron --
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reportin:
toicase Officers and they would report on things in the

community, of people they thought were suspect and this type

_ of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau

and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

A Source of information of another aqent. Another

0. Do the Files of the Agency reflect anv matter?

A To my knowledae I don't recall anything like that but :

it is entirely possible that that could have happened without
being a matter of record.

0. Do the-files of the Agency reveal any instance what-
ever in which Frank Sturais “as ever asked to undertake anv
kind of an operation or activity on behalf of the Agency?

A, To my knowledge, nothing.

0 Do the files of the Agency reveal any evidence
whatever that Frank Sturgis was ever paid anything directly or
indirectly by the Agencv?

A To mv knowledqe, no.

Qa Now, when vou sav “to my knowledge, no", in answer
to some of these cuestions, do I understand that to mean that
you are giving us the full benefit of your knowledge on the
basis of a full review of the Agency's records and files?

A On Frank Sturgis, ves.

Q And they are on little cards down in your files?

Q Why nave those records been maintained? Is there
any reason those records have been maintained?

places in the country that has been conducted by Cuban
groups?

A I was not aware of it until I was told of it.

I still don't know whether this was a spontaneous action on

Watergate trial. Some of these allegations that came out

and I think they were carried in the Anderson column but we i
made file checks and this tyne of thing. One particular
activity was supposed to have been carried out in Rockefeller |
Center in New York and it turns out it was taken out of
context. It was a training mission and ~- training exercise. |

These guys were being trained in surveillance in New York |

supposed to diagram the layout of the bank. And this to some

does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban

situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

A No. Well, let me explain that to you. We do have
a career agent who has been with us for a good many years
in Miami and we do use him to contact relatives of Cubans
who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S.
who have relatives in Cuba.

; Now, this is done principally with the idea of a
recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths, this
type of thing. He does contact these people all over the
United States. If we come across an individual that looks like
he might be recruitable, or perhaps we could even double hin,
we will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we
find out where relatives and these types of people are, we
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact
these people, be it. New York, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-
ever. .

Q So you use Cuban, now citizens or aliens in this

country, aS access agents.
