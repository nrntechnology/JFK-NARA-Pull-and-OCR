THE VNQDD ‘STRONGHOLD, THE TXPT, ALTHOUGH COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF FORMER
VNQDD MEMBERS, WAS ESTABLISHED ESSENTIALLY AS A BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION
‘AND HAS BEEN LEGALLY ENGAGED IN CIVIC AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES SINCE

ITS FORMATION. CLANDESTINE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION NAS PROCEEDED

FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING NEW, YOUNGER LEADSRS, AND OF DENYING
THE OLDER PASSIVE TENETS OF BUDDHISM AS WELL AS THE OLSER LEADERS

2, THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE REMINDED LUC THAT THE ORGANI-

‘ZATION WAS IN A POSITION TO HANDLE A COUP ACTION IN) CENTRAL VIETKAM
EFFECTIVELY, POINTING OUT THAT THOSE MILITARY UNITS NOT CONTROLLED
_ COULD BE NEUTRALIZED AND THAT THE AIR BASE AT DA NANG COULD BE
CONTROLLED THROUGH THE AIR FORCE. THE COMMITYEE STATED THAT, AFTER
1! THE ANTI-BUDDHIST ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PEOPLE WERE READY
(FOR AN UPRISING. BY TAKING NGO DINH CAN AND ARCHBISHOP NGO OINH

THUC INTO CUSTODY AND BY GAINING MILITARY COKTROL OVER THUA THIEN

; AND QUANG"NAM PROVINCES, SUCCESS COULD BE ASSURED IN CENTRAL VIETNAM,
THIS WOULD PLACE THE TXPT IN A POSITION OF USING PRESIDENT DIEM'S

AND , AT THE-SAME TIME, THEY WOULD BE-MOUNTING A COUP AGAINST THE
REGIME IN-SAIGON, WHICH wouLD TAKE PLACE NO LATER THAN THREE DAYS
AFTER THE ONE IN CENTRAL VIETNAM, .
+3. LUC SENT A TRUSTED FOLLOWER, ONE VIET TO SAIGON TO DISCUSS
THE PLAN WITH AN OPPOSITION ST SYMPATHIZER AND GET HIS VIEWPOINT. .
VIET WAS ADVISED TO TELL LUC THAT ANY SUCH ACTION WAS PRECIPITATE
AND DANGEROUS. ALTHOUGH IT WAS PROBABLY TRUE THAT THE FORMER VN@DD
_ MEMBERS IN. CENTRAL VIETNAM HAD THE POWER CLAIMED, A COUP THERE,
| WITHOUT SIMULTANEOUS ACTION IN SAIGON, WOULD LEAVE A VACUUM WHICH
THE VIET CONG (VC) COULD IMMEDIATELY USE TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE.
VC REACTION’ PROBABLY WOULD TAKE THE FORM OF GAINING CONTROL OF ALL
AREAS “NOT EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED BY THE COUP GROUP, WITH THE:

_ ULTIMATE POSSIBILITY OF PARTITIONING CENTRAL VIETNAM, OF BEING IN A
POSITION TO FORM A REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT, AND FINALLY, OF BEING
ABLE TO CALL FOR NEGOTIATIONS. THEMSELVES. ACCORDING TO VIET, THIS
FOLLOWED Luc's THINKING, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE HIS FOLLOWERS WERE NOT
INA POSITION TO ACT IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. VIET

THOUGHT THAT ‘LUC WOULD INSTRUCT THE TXPT CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN.
CENTRAL VIETNAM TO TAKE NO ACTION AT THIS TIME, AND THAT LUC'S

ADVICE WOULD BE ACCEPTED.
