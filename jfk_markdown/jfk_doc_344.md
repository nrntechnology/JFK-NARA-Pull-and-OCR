trative activities are conducteé. and where zectings of union leaders are
held. $o far meetings have not ‘taken place at work centers. i

“'§. Transactions beb-een labor. and the government are‘carried out by labor
delegates Celio Gonzalez, through the Ministry. of Labor, never directly.

6. Labor, as such, does not subscribe. to any one particular political party. |
fhe Marxist theories do not appear to appeal to Labor Unions. However, .
many oi’ their menbers. do seem to be leaning towards the Liberal Party. 5

eo °Je On the surface Labor Unions' actions in Honduras appear to be denagogic
at tines. éy make demands on the goveriiment, industry and businesses
in spite of their knowing that their demands may prove to be harmful to. :
the economy of their country. It would be rather unfair to always hold :

* ghe Honduran Union Leaders responsible for this demagogism, because __
frequently the union members themselves are guilty of pressuring their. »,
leaders to execute some specific demand, even though they hud already :

been wamed of the possible paraful effects. i

of preparation. ]

1. .Presiceat Oswaldo Lonez Arellano is interested in a second term. This opin—
ion is based on a growing cozseasus among Congressmen, Zoncuran business
leaders and the military that Lopez desires to remain in office for another
term. The thinxing in these Honduran circles is that the lack of disclainers
by Lopez is, in itself, a strong indication of his "continuisno” plans. Ap-

imately ten cays ago Herasn Fescua, =anezer of the tetional Railroad,
headquartered in San Pedro Suia, nad a ‘Ciscussion with the President éuring
which Pascua passed the recarx that he would lixe to reszin with the railroad
&s long as Lesez renained in office. Lopez mace no specific rejoinder to
this but Pascua ieft the President's office with the distinct imoression that
' Lopez wouid run for reelection.

2. Lopez would probably be reelected with relative ease. Tce oppositioa Liberal
Party is diviced internally and lacks bora an effective cz Jidate and the
capital necessary to offer a serious chaliezge. .

, 8. The power and influence of Ricardo Zunisa has declined érastically in recent °
'/ gponths. This is not due to acy s::cifie act but more toa growing realization ;
by Presicent Lopez of Zuniga's cishonesty,. axbition for pewer and his in- wi
" ebility to get along with some governcent officials and prominent nilitary \
officers. President Lopez was particularity discayed at Zcniga's handling of
Bonduraa propaganda during the recent Honduran/El Salvaécran border war.
st Lopez allegedly felt that the invective agaiast El Salvezor often mirrored
-i >: .* tthe type used by Cuban Cocmunisn. sy

4. Miguel Andonie Fernandez, a self-appointed presidential candidate, is an
honest, sincere and well respected man.~ There is a suail group of ‘roughly
ten Arad and- Jewish businesscen in San Peéxo.Sula known as the "economic
mafia" because they control so cuch of Honduran business’ activity. This

‘of ‘ears. He bas social and business contacts with officials of the
government, the armed forces and the business coummity.

{This report was developed by an Army representative assigned
to the office of preparation. ]

For over five years I have been in close contact with Hondurans of.

different backgrounds and social position. Never before have i seen the
anti-American sentiment which is sweeping Honduras at the present time.

The feeling is not only evident among student and labor organizations,

but anong sectors of what is considered to be the best informed and :
educated individuals in the country. Most of them are convinced :
that the US has. the influence to exert diplomatic pre.sures on El Sal- ae
‘yador in order to settie the pending border dispute, put has failed

to do so. ‘They see the US Government as favoring El Salvador.

During conversations with several government officials they emphatically
stated that Honduras was not going to open the Pan American Highway to
Selvadoran treffic. This is the attitude of almost everybody that I
talked with. This single issue has served to unite the country like
never before. There is a new feeling of patriotism which was lacking
before the conflict with El Salvador. : :

3. The campaign againse Salvadoran: products has resulted in an incentive .
for Honduran investors. I have had several inquiries from Honduran

businessmen who are interested in establishing production facilities for
consumer articles which were normally imported from El Salvador. . 3
These individuals are eager to invest and establish factories in order $
to £411 the deomad for products which were imported from El Salvador. i

-&. Honduras has been purchasing arms and armsunition froa Portuguese and }
"- Belgien sources. Some of this armament has arrived in the country. i
According to @ military informant most ef the armament has not been i
delivered, but is expected in the country before the end of the year. |

armed forces, and the business: community.

“During the meeting Colonel Coreccolli inquired about the possibility of a legal
‘or illegal purchase of approxieately 2500 M-1 rifles and an undetermined amount .
‘of .30 caliber ammunition from US sources. He. explained that the weapons were
needed to arm personnel with prior military service in case of a renewal of
hostilities with El Salvador. These individuals were considered to be 2 re-
-perve for the Honduran Armed Forces. : '

‘My associate explained to Colonel Coreccolli that under the circumstances the
US Government would not issue an export permit for the armaments. As for il-
legal sources my associate disclaimed knowledge of any. He also considered ;
the transportation problem. Colonel Coreccolli stated that if acquired the os
‘weapons could be smuggled aboard a Honduran refrigeration ship which was an-
chored in the Miami River at that time. Following this Colonel Coreccolli :
closed the meeting indicating that he was going to explore other possibilities. |

Following the meeting my associate had a conversation with Rigoberto Sandoval, *

a@ member of the Planification Board. Upon being informed of the meeting, Sandoval
warned ay associate to be careful in any dealings with Colonel Coreecolli, since

he was known as a corrupt government official, a "thief". Sandoval stated that;
this was the opinion of President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who distrusted Corec- |

Cuben national, en engineer, vho has worked and lived in Hondures for the
last tvo years. During this period he has developed social end business £
contacts with officials in government, the armed forces and the business :
commnity. .

[his report was developed by an Arzy representative assigned to the
office of preparstic:..] . .

The arned forces are doing & splendid job in their civic action projects. .

Their prisary interest seems to te the construction and repair of roads ‘ wee
‘throughout the Republic. In conversation vith a liaison officer between i
the army and other government agencies he centioned that the only diffi- 3
culties they ere fecing in their progress is tae lack of adequate equipment,
and the leck of cooperation by the Public Works Office. He told me that - .

dn wost instances the requests made by the arny for the use of additional
transportation or utilization of existing equipment are disregarded by 5
minor officials. This creates: problems requiring the action of higher :
officials, who are given the inpression that the arny is the originator of

these probleas.

“2B. Considering the available resources end fecilities of the country the
arned forces are well trained snd disciplined. During the latter part of
1967 President Anastacio Somoza and a group of other Nicaraguan dignitaries
visited Honduras. Several groups under Communist influence deconstrated
against the visit. I had the opportunity to observe the development of
the denonstration, froma s meeting to 8 riot, frou a vantage point. .Despite =
the fact that the army riot control troops vere stoned and abused they 3
were disciplined enough to prevent vhat could have been a serious incident. ;
They did not attack or fire at the cob, as would have been the desire of ;
‘the leaders, who incidentally alvays remained behind the mob and utilized .

’ other people to direct and incite the deuonstretors. The troops and junior -

. ; 7 officers vho were present during the denonstretion were highly praised by

woe iees - he responsible elements of the society. . ne

_ 2. During the same private conversation, General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano was
quoted as having stated that it world be futile for him to lead a coup
d'etat unless there was hope of izproving the welfare of the sasses and
the general economy of the country as well; he fimly believes it would
be impossible to accomplish that goal until a change in must of the above
conditions were met prior td*any coup d'etat in which he would be interested.

3. Selected Honduran army officers have attended special courses at an arny
facility in Peru since approximately 1967. According to an army officer
the number of candidates sent since early 1972 has not only. been increased :
but also each has been ordered to specialize in any one cf the brwches of - - -

their choice. They previously attended the various courses given at that ° ; i ‘

facility.

4. The army gives an outward appearance of being in sympathy with the present
regime, but in reality not all the members sympathize with President Cruz.
In private conversations some speak of him in a derogatory manner, espec—
jally young officers. ” : £

3. A man who contimes to wield a gecat deal of power in Wonduras is Ricerdo
Zuniga Augustinus, Minister of Government and Justice, also leader of the
Nationalist Party. quniga's ability to continue wielding power is due to
bis being a very clever, astute, wealthy man. He always knows exactly
what he wants, and does not hesitate to utilize his personal character

- istics and his wealth .in obtaining his objectives.

6, Zuniga's present ambition for continued power has forced him to feign
being a Firm constitutionalist. That is, he is claiming loud and clear

that commitments made between the government and political parties must 5
Zuniga does not clain i

this because he really believes this to be a moral obligation, or because — .
he is a fervent democrats The fundamental reeson is that he knows he is A $
as well as having becone :

the recognized leader of the Nationalist Party,
influential in the Liberal Party. He believes these parties are the ones

sustaining the present regime of President Reson Ernesto Cruz in power
Therefore, he calculates that through these two parties he can protract

the power he has today.

4. Today relations betwen General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano and Zuniga are not
as cordial as they were previously. However, one must not be led to be-
Jieve that this situation is unrepairable because if Zuniga needed Lopez
Arellano's help, or vice versa, the former pleasant r *ationship would
be hastily nursed back to life. It is just possible cat if a coup d'etat
led. by General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano should take place, and be successful,
Zuniga would make a great effort to settle any differences existing between -
them. This might not please some of the army officers who dislike Zuniga.

due to, his character and the procedures used by him to obtain power. 5

. Up to the present time the Armed Forces do not appear to be leaning towards —

the left®, They are naturally desirous of improving their way of life. :
The Air Force has recently organized a company whose entire net profits
will go to the Air Force for the benefit of its members. General Oswaldo

i 7 z Arellano is investing in various industries and small private

. industries. He has very recently established a company called Empacadora |

de Carnes (meat packing firm) whose net profits will be for himself alone.
_ Fhe Areed Forces hold General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano in the highest

° aa esteem. This knowledge is based on his observations and personal contact
; with officers and enlisted men. } :
