A Military Profile !
i

ITCHELL WERBELL Is a short, ;
N wiry man of 52, quick with a
quip and quite sensible until he begins
laiking about communism or other so-
clal issues. He has the face and bear-
ing of a Prussian officer, an image he
cultivated by wearing a musiache and
occasionally a morocle. He often
dress military clothing of Indetcr-
minate origin, and he embellishes the
image by talking §n slightly clipped
sentences peppered: with military |
phrases. There is nothing phony in
this, WerBell has a strong aftachment .
to weapons and to warfare, and he has -

“been Bround them so ‘long ‘that the

ideas and styles they foster are an in-
grained part of his personality.

He comes by beth his militarism and
his anticommuntsn honestly. His

(nicky situation,” says Mitch, “He was
a citizen of both the U.S. and Russia.
In those days you could do that.”

The elder Werfell fought against ;
the Bolsheviks, but before the collapse
of the czarist redime he wiscly secured
4n -appuintment*as ‘liaison otficer be-
tween the . Russlan and American
forces—stationed in the U.S. He lived?

he was head ‘of the department, and
soon after that he went on his own,

In the mid-'50s, WerBell pulled out
of his agency and then formed his

but Nis business :cok on more and

flavor,

Before long, he was dabbling in
Latin. American dictatorstips. “Before
Fidel took over in Cuba, we were

with a grin, “Our function was to keep

Fro alt this, even WerBell doesn't
Know evactly how, came a passionate
conecrn about communism. “| decided
to devote whatever time J could to
anticommunist activities,” he says.
At first It was sort of a hobby, but.
then il became my main drive In life.
What I'm doing now'—here he kes:
tures at the arsenal on his office walls
“affords me a damned ood Iving.
But the living ts not why I do it.”

The Heart of It
N 1948, WHILE anticommunism was
sul a hobby, albelt a paying hobby,
WerBell purchased the Dobbs estate.

That's a Int of bull. The best way to
get their hearts, if they're the enemy,
is ta shoot ‘em and cut the hearts

While he experimented with weap-
ons—quiclly, to avold problems with
the federals—WerBell proceeded with

his personal brand of geopolitics. He

made himself avaitab!e to anticommu-
nist regimes that wanted help in fight-

WerBell was already’ active in the
anti-Castro movement, and he brought
to it a sense of dash and discipline that
the ragtag, bickering bu of Cuban
exlics had seldom seen. Perhaps his
major antt-Castro exploit was'a speed:
boat foray into Camarioca, on Cuba's
Southern coast. The sion. was to
drop a swimmer, apparently a spy, off-
shore, and to pick up the family of an
exile leader. The boat, flying the Con
federate flag on the radio antenna,
foundered In high seas, and the raiding
party was captured. The Cubans, the *

‘The answers to “why” WerBeil got in-
volved are, in the language of the sub-
committee report, “at vanance” with
each other:

JAnswer No, [: °° (felt then and I

effort or any activity that any American
can give to a group that is attempting to

the Western Hemisphere deserves every
effort. This was my fundamental! reason
for going into it. This was why I agreed to
assist them and why I did everything 1
could to assist them up to the point
where I felt the whole program was ridicu-
lous.”* .
~ Answer No. 2: "1 took this whole proj-
ect as a rather entertaining comedy. I’m

and I continued to do so. | felt that this
was @ Very amateurish attempt at some-
thing which I didn’t know really what
was going on, and it was an interlude of
entertainment as far as I'm concerned.”
The role he. played is also unclear,
.From the point that CHS entered the sit-
uation in May of 1966. WerBell appeared
at various times to be a network consul-
tant, a CIA operative, a CIA operative
impostor, a leader of the invasion, a U.S.
government spy on the invasion, a gun-

-munner and a wired-for-sound observer in

an attempt to shake down the Haitian
consul in Miami for $200,000 to call off
the invasion. .

Suffice it to say that the entire episode
was typified by tne fact that the 68-foot
sloop Poor Richard, a beat WerBell had
leased for the expedition, was repossessed
while Werdell and others had it docked
at the Ocean Reef motel in Key Largo.

WerBeil. ‘Charges . against WerBell,

_. WerBell now -declines to’ discuss the
mechanics of how the charges against
him were dropped, except lo say that he
was “in constant contact with the govern-
ment” during his participation in. the in-
vasion altempt and that he “did nothing

* wrong.” In 1970, however, WerBell told

an.Atianta magazine writer, “When you
work for the company, they take care of
you.”

“The company” is generally used asa

euphemism for the Central Intelligence

Agency — an arm of government WerBell

says now he has never had anything to do
with, except to sell it some guns. The
company he was talking about, he says,
was CBS. Over the years, however, Wer-
Bell has spoken often. of his association
with the Company. Producer McMatlen
quoted WerBell to the congressmen as say-
ing he had * revious experience” with “the

" company.” “And when I asked him what
company he meant, he said the Cla,” Me-

Mullen said.

“Everybody always gets that impression
about any goddam thing we do,” WerBell
says. It is a conclusion that is neither
difficult nor illogical. It may not, however,
be accurate. .

his : firm's revolutionary silenced sub-

al?

To quéstions such as these, WerBell’s
standard reply is, ““I guess I'm just lucky.”
More than just luck, howevez, WerBell’s
propensity for being in'the crucial place
at the crucial time seems to stem from 8
combination of machismo, the profit mo-
tive, aknack far developing sums otly rad-
ical weaponry and a plug-in tothe Old Boy
Network.

The Old Boy Network — “And don't you
ever kid yourself that there isn’t such @
thing,” says WerBell — is the cloak-and-
dagger types’ answer to the union hiring
halt. It is a loosely structured help want-

- ed-situatiun wanted grapevine. “I became

friends with a bunch of guys who are now
four- and five-star generals,” recalls Wer-
Bell of his days as an OSS captain behind
Japanese fines in World War I. :

Mhemorabitia of the OSS days and sub-
sequent adventures hang in WerBell’s
home and in his psyche. The walla of both
his upstairs den and downstairs “war
room" are decorated with dozens of hunt-
ing (upstairs) and military (downstairs)
weapons. Six unsheathed swords are
mounted cn the dvor of the liquor cabinet.
Two glass display cases in the den, each
locked, contain handguns ranging. from
standard .45 automatics to single-shot
assassination pistols. Daggers, bayonets
and throwing knives fill the in-between
spares as bric-a-brac. Photographs of
short, slant-eyed generals hang on walls
and stand on tables. Between two wild boar
heads above the den entrance is a framed
certificate from the Vietnamese Airbome.

The biggest war souvenir. though, isn't
on WerBell's wail. [t is in his head — the
way a man of 55 acts after more than 20
years of being in and on the fringes of vio-

lent conflicts. Some of it, obviously, is ©

affectation. Some of it is genuine. And
some of it just seems strange to sn outsider

Mirror (circulation five million) that he
was: I) four-square for the cause of the
Council for a Free Abaco, and 2) récruiting
British mercenaries “for a project J have in

said WerBell. The fruit of the interview

WILLIAM R AMLONG oa Heraid stati writer, -

was a front-page story headlined: “Mutiny
in Paradise . .. The Island That Wants to
Stay British - A Call Goes Out fur Mer-

- Genaries.”

- Such were the initial tactics in the Bat-
tle of Abaco, a cause that, for swhile in the
British press, seemed second in anticipated
ferocity only to the Catholics-vs.-Protes-
tants strife in Northern Ireland. Joining
WerBell as a comrade-in-press release was
Lt.-Col. Colin (Mad Mitch) Mitchell, a
right-wirig House of Commons member
and a hero of the Battle of Aden during his
days with the Argyle & Sutherland
Highlanders. Mitchell, who was muttering
tothe Bntish press ‘about. secret missions to
Abaco and the such, recently visited Wer-
Bell in Powder Springs, WerBell said.
‘While there are some people who: admire
fldmboyance atich as WerBell's, there are

WerBell’s former business associates, a
group of New York investment bankers
who bought WerBeil and Bennett B.
Bintliff, an associate, out of the Military
Armament Corp. (MAC) that' the pair had
founded. “He's been headline press all over
England, ond we're just 6 quict little man-

Reeves, however, says he doesn't dislike
WerBell — he just doesn't want to be
associated with him in the arms business.
“like him a great deal. He's amusing and
he's a character. But letting him run Colt
or jetting him run MAC is like turning
loose a high-school hot. todder to: run
General Motors.”

WerBell and his associates in Powder
Springs have now reincorporated under the
name of Defense Systems International
Inc. and have hired away several of MAC's
former weapons specialists. They are not
overly fond of Reeves and his people either.
“Tunnel vision” is one phrase they use to

direct descendant of the white Tories who.
settled Abaco immediately after the Amer-
ican’ Revolution rather than be separated
from the British Crown. He savs he was
referred to WerBell through persons he met .
while organizing a demonstration against
allowing Air Cuba to service the Nassau
airport. “The people f met there, basically
right-wing. were able to put me on to Wer-
Bell.” Hall is secretary of the council.

With a budget that they wiil desenbe 20
more specifically than to say it is less than
350,090 and made up entirely of small can-
tributions from Bahamians, the group is
paying WerHell and Marger an undisclosed
fee through Zeta, a dummy corporation
founded solely for the Abaco venture. Why
it was necessary to establish such a
company is unclear. Of its name, WerBell
says, “I think it’s Greek for war.

But just what the Zeta Co. or Operation
Zeta — it’s referred to as both — 1s doing
for the Ahaconian secessionists is some-

‘what uncertain. So far, there has been
some lobbying of Parliament in London by. -

Marge rt, a lawyer with U.S. lobbying expe-
rience and a background in.intemational
Jaw, but about as un-Brit‘sh a fellow as

there is. There. have been some saber.rat- -

pers. There have been conversations with
Mad Mitch. And there has even been note
of the plight of the Abaconian secessionists

E quartor's Traces on the Military Armanent_Corporation._
sciew ence MHANGS ART OAS Stated in Paragraph Three ,

Reference: Port Louis 12011, 17 May 1973.

... 4. There are no Headquarter's traces on Dr. George A. Winkler,
but there are traces on the Military Armament Corporation and its
Board Chairman, Mr. Mitchell Livingston WerBell IIf (201-259910)..

In 1967 WerBell organized a firm called SIONICS, Incorporated

(Studies in Operational Negation of Insugency and -Counter Subversion),
+Specializing in producing silencers. In 1970, Werbell Bskged with .
Quantum, Ordnance Bankers and the new firm was named the Military —
Armament Corporation with werBell-as Chairman of the Board.

.2. “WerBell- was, born.:on..8 March 1918 in Philadelphia,’ Pennsylvania.

He’ served in: the OSS \and:was ‘of interest to BKHERALD in 1959 when it
was discovered-that.he was. involved :with anti«Castro plotters in
‘| the Dominican Republic. “He was granted a POA in August 1959 but this
“Was cancelled in. October .1959:-when his information Proved to be of
fd. le. Value and it.-was ‘suspected that he was using BKHERALD funds

/ to promote personal interests. He has subsequently attempted to

~ pass himself as LNBUZZ connected. and as a BKHERALD employee. Mr.
-WerBell's lengthy.201 file shows a long history of his appearing in
areas’and situations where he can make a fast buck.. He is character-
ized-as unscrupulous, a "wheeler dealer", and a promotor of grandiose
schemes, WOTACK advises that the arms WerBell offers for sale are

of good quality, but that the selling price is considered excessive.

3. In that Mr. WerBell is a WODUAL citizen, the above infor-
mation should not be. passed to CGPAT/1. -However, the Station could
inform CGPAT/1 that ‘the Military Arriament Corporation has an unsavory
reputation and, although it may have permission from NVIDEA to export
-;-arms; -it~ has” no“ LNBUZZ connections and that any dealings with the
-¢orporation should be approached with extreme caution.

Contact Service is to receive information which individuals
feel is of interest to the United States Government. The office
is overtly sted in the telephone book under the Central Intel-

If Mr. WerBell suggests an affiliation with the Central

- detaiis of his alleged affiliation in the hearing go that he may

not use ostensible security as a means of avoiding answering

SUBJECT -: Washington Evening Star Article entitled "The

. “Story of CFS and the Piot to Tavade Haiti”

which. appeared in the 26 february 1970 Edition

- 1. Subject article reported that a CBS cameronan,
Janes, WILSON, “had contacted CIA agentes in Houston while
- on a. space shot assignment ina 1966, end ‘that the CIA bead -
- informed the FBI, who called on WILSON and referred hin |”
‘to U.S, Customs. ~ , , .

2. WH Division has, ascertained that on 30 June 1966,

‘a James WILSON called the CIA Duty Officer of the Donestic |

Contact Service (DCS) office in Hougton,. Texas, and sub-
sequently related a story akout a proposed plot being
__Btaged in the 0.8, to invade Haiti and overthrow the

Duvalier Governrent, and that CES had convinced the parties
involved that -they should allow CBS to photourapbh and
televise a Special Procram on the preparations. WILSON
requested aad received sasurances from the DCS officer

that he would not be identified as the source of this

.... inforantion.

3. On 6 July 1966, WH Division sent a blind penom
vandum to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
Department of State which forwarded a resume of WILSON's
story to the DCS, without identifying the source. The
remorandum stated that the source's motive for disclosing
this information was to alert the U.3. Covernment to &

potentially enkarrassing situation if tt were involved
in an ingecure operation. The JM#AVE Station also passed
a resume of this information to the U.S, Customs Puresu
An Kiand. . : : :

In consequence we have prepared a pilot program with the objective
of neutralizing she Co:nmunist terrorist threat in Thailand. We

- “have enti.led the program "Neutralisa:ion of :he Communist Terrorist

enconipasses jive major phases and. spans a twelve mon‘h program.
Basically we ofier a proven program based, in part, on the out-
giandingly successtul.U. S. Sth Division Sniper Program in the
Delta of Vietnau:, Finally, and most impor-.an:ly, thie program
is also besed on Special Operations programe executed by members

g wartime, counerinsurgency and

South Asia, Europe, South America,

guerrilla operarions executed in
Dominican Republic, and Vietnam,
We have selected a .eam of highly qualified experts whose ‘combined .
