REF: UFGA-%425 dated 19 June 1962

‘1. SUMMARY: In the period since ref prorress report
AMDENIN=-1 has been primarily enraged in keeping his fences mended
with the various exile croups inthe area in anticipation of. mov-.
ing inta.a.pesition in the AMBUD-l-oreanfzation in which he will
-a_respensible for coordinating ‘the seledtion of paramilitary =~
dates. From these groups, In additidn to this he has prepared

a nuater of reports providing backeround information,-and on cur-

"fishermen thru his own fisherman contacts. Details follow: .

OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

2. In response to a Station request subject provided an
estimate of the current situation in PBRUMEN. This report
stressed the points that the farmers and the fishermen. in PBRUMEN
are the most willing and capable of providing support to resis-
tance activities as a result of their having suffered the “most at
the hands of the current administration after being largely —
responsible for its obtaining power, He also provided a general
strategic plan of Oriente Province in which he defined the main
-areas in which guerrilla elements can survive and how they can be
reached fron coastal resupply points. His ability to do ‘this is
based upon his being a native of the area and one who has been
primarily interested in its geography due to his former large.

“agriculture holdings there. _ aaa

3._ He has had one meeting with AMBUD-1 for the purpose of
maintaining contact. His main question to AMBUD-1 “was with regard
_ to the latter's ability to actually control the people on his staff.
He was disappointed by the reply which though positive could not be’
supported with an example of where AMBUD-1 had actually brought ~~

about the dismissal of anvone who had proved to be ineffective,
AMDENIM-1 is a rood friend of AMBUNeL as a result of his father's
long standing relationship with hin, but at this point has very

, little respect fer him as a result of, as he says, AMBUD-1's

Following his belief that the most incortant job at hand

_ is the development and maintenance of maritime reception points

.. time to readying assets anong his exiled fisherman friends to make

PBRUMEN. The foundation for this activity is quite. tenuous asa

to organize this group in order to be able to take over its more

on to help bring the UR into the AMBUD-1 orpanization as a means
of creating the appearance of greater unity among the exile

community. .

8. COMMENTS AND FLANS: While no spectacular achievements are

resulting from AMDENIM-l's efforts at this point he is steadil
becoming more and more susceptible to KUBARK control and more

“pro stona 3 efforts. A recent example 18 the critique he
gave his fishermen for not realizing more information out of the
refugees they met at Anguila Key while waiting for their inside
contact, They had failed to adequately debrief two young men, who
had succeeded in surviving in PBRUMEN for over two. months on their
own, on the basis that they were too young to be knowledgeable. .
As it turned out the two refugees had used the cover-of’ 2
salesmen and had been able to travel from Havana to. $a itiago de
Cuba without being stopped once. On learning of this’, AMDENIM-1
was reminded of a good cover he has heard about, namély fighting
