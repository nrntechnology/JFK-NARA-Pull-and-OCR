two other Soviets were alréady there fishing in front of the ©

“the Soviets came to the cabins. and Nick greoted YATSKOV and

introduced his Mexican friend to him. YATSKOV did not introduce | /

the other two.Soviets by name but they all did shake hands.
: Nick invited them all into his rooa but only YATSKOV came; *
He accepted a drink and.left with it, Later outside Nick -
asked: one of. the new Soviots ‘his. name ‘and. got the. answer,
“Vasilio,” The ‘other one ‘then used an. English. word and Nick
‘asked. if‘ho spoke English. This. Soviet said his nano’ was’
Viktor and that he’ spoké a. little English. Nick then asked
‘YATSKOV which of thé other. two was the newly arrived Soviet.
YATSKOV said that it was Viktor. Nick then lent them his.

“3 The next ‘day both: groups. fished. Separately at.
Sabanita. About noon-YATSKOV came by and: noticed that Nick
