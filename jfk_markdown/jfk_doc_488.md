you. would provide us with the” results of your interview

“with Miles as well as personality toformation about bina

that she may acquire in the future. ~

3. We would also like to have your comments, about
considering Rodriguez.as a potential penetration of the
DGI in Cuba.” There is the. possibility” that Hiles might
‘be used to assist in approaching Rodriguez if, for.

: 3.. I asked. ‘WUSLAB/1 what he considered the possibilities -
’ of recruiting’ Vieta were. He thought an important factor would
be ‘Viera's liking.of comfort and security. .He would not be
| motivated by money, but he aid like good living. ‘He ‘Also pro-
bably did not, like living in’ Havana, and would not: like to stay
there for a very long period. W/1l thought that if Viera came
out to a country such aS Spain that contact with him could
oo : easily be ‘developed. In the United States Viera was on his
ary “guard, Also in the. United States Viera did not ‘nave -high level
: » contacts with the - local government, whereas in other countries .
“he would be expected to have such contacts. Some of those con-
tacts might then be also in contact with U.S.-officials and you
could get a cross-check on Viera. I ‘told WUSLAB/1 that we would
finish the PCQ fora on Viera the: next time we get together.

have been able to state evidentially as to whether VIERA or JIMENEZ Escobar

DGI Station Chief, We both, however, tend to regard JIMENEZ as car rying the
most weight in terms of operational activity and in terms of effectiveness, Now,
with the arrival of BOZA Hidalgo-Gato (who reportedly has been the deputy to
Ramon OROZA Naveran, head of U.S. operations for the DGI, per our last

than VIERA or JIMENEZ. With JIMENEZ, VIERA, BOZA, and PRENDES
