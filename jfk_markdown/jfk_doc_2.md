MENO FOR THE RECORD yF _Osw4sn's Stay ~y BORO Ae Jovwh)
QU
° 1. At 0900 this morning I talked with Frank Friberg receatly
returned COS Helsinki re Warren Commission inquiry concerning:
the timetable of Oswald's stay in Finland in October 1959, ineluding
his contact with the Soviet Consulate there. (Copy of the Commission
letter of 25 May 64 and State Cable of 22 May 64 attached.)

2. Friberg gave me the following information:

a. It takes 25 minutes to drive from the airport to
downtown Helsinki;

b. By taxi, it would take no more than 5 minutes to
reach the Soviet consulate;

c. The Seviet consulate probably closéd at 1300 hours local
time on Saturdays in 1959; ;

qd. Passenger lists Qnanifests), at the U.S. Consulate in
Helsinki are retained for six months only and then are destroyed.

Mr. Robert Fulton (CIA) was U.S. consular official there at
the time.

e. A copy of State's cable inquiry would go to the Helsinki
Station and they would assist in preparation of a reply.

ee 3. Mr. Friberg agreed that it would be worthwhile to cable che
Station concerning points not covered by State in their inquiry. He
suggested changes incorporated into the cable sent to Helsinki.
