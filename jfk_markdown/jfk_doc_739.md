Attempted R.I.8. Penetration of Bell Telephone Labs

Ref: MX Reports 2988-3 and 2989-3

1. We thought the attached reports would be of interest to Lincoln’
8taff from a Soviet realities standpoint. We also felt that they should
be brought to the attention of Division management because the M.O. out-
lined therein is becoming 4 mJjor factor in dealing with sources who have ’
contact with Sovbloc nationals. It hag been our experience that the type
of activity outlined haz been on a mrked increase, particularly since
the establishment of the KOB 10th Directorate. Although such activity
by Sov legals is taking place throughout the continental U.3., undoubtedly
its greatest impact t# being felt in the New York and Washington, D.C.
“areas because of the larg Soviet Government establishaents in both of
these cities. For this reason it would seem imperative that both WAFO
and NYFO be extremely vigilant for auch activity in companies and insti-
tutions with which they are dealing in order that it my be recognized
in its earliest stages and appropriate CI/CE countermeasures instituted.
In order to assist other offices in this respect, ve plan to vrite in the
near future an article for the Division Newsletter, outlining some of our
experiences along these lines.

2. We were somevhat disappointed in CI Staff's reaction to our
recent request for assistance in defensive briefing of the subject of

one of the attached reports. It seems to be quite clear now that our
original assumption concerning his being R.I.8. targeted was quite correct
and that there to a strong likelihood that his current trip behind the
Curtain will be utilized by the opposition for provocation and/or an
actual recruitment attempt. We wonder in future cases of this nature
exactly what support we may expect from Angleton's shop. Although we

“feel that we have a fair capability for handling such matters here in

Bew York, we do admit that, at least on this one, we would have felt
slightly more comfortable had a CI specialist been along, if for no other
reason than to preclude any possible Monday morning quarterbacking by the

Subject: Attempted R.I.S. Penetration of Bell Telephone Laba

3. Judging dy the attached mterial, it would appear that, despite
established Bell ‘policy (see our 16 May memorandum re Case 39,790), the
opposition has seen fit to deflower at least tvo of Bell's scientific
virgins. We serfously wonder at this point just how many other Bell
people. might be in the same boat. Perhaps, as a result of ali this,
some representation by Bell management to the KOB will be forthcoming,
spelling out..to that organization, as was spelled out to our ow, estabd=
lished company policy pertaining to such mitters. In any event, it would
appear that at least one or two Bell scientists, and there are probably
more, have been giving the 8.1.8, more cooperation and reporting than the
Agency. Let's hope that in the near future Bell management takes some .
effective steps to rectify this rather ludicrous, and patently: dangerous, .
aituation. se

1M 0930-1230 hours J Juuc, Manfred 4. Senrueder ci Bell Labs
received a strong defensive briefing in conpection with his June-
July trip to the YSSk und Sulguria (eee map 7 May Coorlinatlon Out-
line for subject)* During Schrveder's briefing, Magic ellelted
from him that prior to a trip to tae USSR in 1959 he bad been en-
tacted by an individual. who represented hinsel? as u West German
Intelligence Officer. More importunt, we eise learned that, ut
about the same tiue, RIS cultivation oi Schroeder apparently began.

f. 2. Concerning the West German approach, Gchroeter indleated
that his mother, who resides in Hamburg, wa. ue aned in Loos by

an individual who cleized to be an old acaun.inuance of her son's

and who was interested in contacting hin concerning employment in

the US. The caller left a phone uwnse~ and rafi that he would ap-
préeciate 1b if Senroeder could call hin nexe tam: he was iu Hasburg.
Schroeder's mother relayed the message .o ite con, and, os requested,
he telephoned the caller just nrivr to his ivy, USGR junzct. The
individual he called identiried himselt ar West Gerwnn inte) Livence
Officer and said that be would likn to mes. ochrecder as coon ag

and expressed interest in Senrocder's urly t ta: GSR. According ta
Schroeder's account, tke West Geran Invelligence Officer gave him the
old “keep your cyes and vars open” pitch, and 4:14 him that he would
contact him in the ‘iret West German city wiiek he touched dow
after his USSR trip. Schroeder was convacted in Stuttgart promptly
after returning to Germany from the un his way puck to the US.
Because of his US employnent and the fact thay Zell paid tor his trip,
Schroeder became very apprehensive about any further contact with the
West Germun service and et the time of the call indicated tact he nad

10. ateer Schrveder visits the USSR on his current trip, he
-. plans to fly to Sofia to spend approximately a week with his wife's
“family there. Schroeder had not mentioned the Bulgarian visit in
outlining his original itinerary to Bob Martin of this office, there-
fore, it vas not mentioned in Schroeder's Coordination Outline.

11. All of the above would seém to indicate quite strongly that

" Sahroeder, ag we originally surmised, hao been targeted by R.I.3. In-

briefing Schroeder, we ran through soma of the typical entrapment

situations fabricated by the opposition, e.g., women, homosexuals,

‘ purdbase of drugs for Sov citizens, black mrket activity, acceptance
of letters to mail outside the USSR, commitments to disaffected Sovs,
etc. In addition, we stringently admonished Schroeder against any
notetaking or photography which could in any way be construed as com-

. promising. We also alerted Schroeder to the fact that some attempt

‘ might be made to use his ife's family aa leverage in a recruitment

attempt. In this connection, we pointed out to Schroeder that there
was @ strong likelihood that the R.I.S. and/or Bulgarian service would
make an approach to him during his forthcoming visit to Sofia. An
approach in Bulgaria would give the Sove an opportunity for disavowal

° and also would provide the proper setting for maximum utilization of

* relatives. When Schroeder mentioned that his sister-in-law, FNU
Mensckik, bad indicated several times in the past that she would like
to leave Bulgaria, we etrongly admonished him against making any com-
mitments to her, pointing out that she may possibly be co-opted by
the opposition. We told Schroeder that any representations to gain
an-exit viea for his sister-in-law should be channeled through the
US Legation in Sofia, Schroeder was told that, if any pressure were
applied concerning his vife's family, his best reaction would probably
be a noncommittal, "I'll think it over when I get home?" All in ali,
we alerted Schroeder as best we could to the opposition M.0. and pre-
pared him on how best to avoid some of the not so obvious pitfalls
which might be in store for hin.

12. Prior to our briefing of Schroeder, Bob Martin alerted Bell
management to all of the remifications of Schroeder's travel behind
the Curtain. The management was informed by Martin that we felt it
our obligation to point out to them the strong possibility that Schroeder
had been targeted in order that they would have all of the facts avail-

able before signing off on his trip.

; - 13., Asseaament of Schrueder: Subject, a very accomplished
ie - scientist, heads up all acoustics research at Bell. He reads _ : (Nr
‘Russian and is flucnt in Cermen, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, :
and English. He impresses us as being a rather savvy, discreet, - 4

: cooperative, mature, stable, well motivated individual. We attri-

po bute Schroeder's apparent lack of discretion in his dealings with

1 the Bove more to the subtlety of the Sov approach than to his own

: paivete. It has been our exyerience that most US businessmen and

i mo scientists are very susceptible and vulnerable to the opposition

. "approach mainly due to somewhat of a lack of realistic public . +
education. concerning contacts with Sovbloc nationals. We feel .
that Bchroeder's degree of cooperativeneas with US services has

been enbanced conaiderably by his feeling that he has really been

taken for a ride by the opposition.

Incidentally, when we asked subject for permission to release this
information with source disclosure to the FBI, he was at firet some-
what apprehensive and expressed the desire to talk it over with one
. of big Bell superiors before he made eny commitments. He finally
. agreed, hovever, when we convinced him that it would certainly be in
‘ his best interest to get on record vith the FBI as soon as possible.
: Most of his apprehension about the FBI seemed to be attributable to
the fact that he has just been granted US citizenship and, in addition,
is now somewhat concerned that hie activities with the Sova in some
way mny effect his security status which in turn could be very detri-
Sental to his career.

i Based on our limited contact with Schroeder, we have every reason to
Hl believe that he would be suitable for operational use, should the
; Bbareau choose to pursue such a course.

: 14. We would strongly recommend that all of the above be passed

. to the Bureau ASAP in order that that organization my effect contact
with Schroeder and provide him with proper guidance concerning any
further approaches by Sov or Bloc nationale in this country.

1. During routine debriefing of Donald 5. Thomas of Bell Labora-
tories in connection with his recent USER visit to attend the Popov .
Soctety Meeting, 5-14 May, Moscow (see NYOR 8878 for Coordination Out-
line)+ subject mentioned having had recent contact with a Soviet Govern-
tment representative in this country. The Soviet in question tdentified
Chimself to Thomas as Gleb Aleka? Pavlov and gave his address as 1216

. First Avenues, Manhat! yy

2. Accbrding to Thomas, his initial contact with Pavlov took

Place in late March following the International Convention and Show
“of the I.B.E.5., 25-29 March, New York City (see Case 39343). At the

: couvention Thomas became friendly with two Soviet counterparts in

; attendance, A. VY. Tiel and Anatole Trutka, both of whom Thomas invited
to his home for a social visit during their US stay. When the Sova
departed fo¥"home following the convention, Thomas saw them off at New
York International Airport. It was at the airport that he first met
Pavlov, who apparently was seeing off all of the Sov I.E.E.E. delegates.
After the Sov delegation had departed, Thowms and Pavlov returned to
Vanhattan together and, on parting, exchanged addresses. ‘

3. A couple of weeks after their initial meeting, Pavlov tele-
phoned Thanas at his home and :told him that Tiel and Trutka had asked
him to send their warmest regards to Thame and thank him for the
hospitality which he showed them during their trip to this country.
During the conversation, Pavlov expressed an interest in renewing his
acquaintance with Thomas, and suggested that he would enjoy visiting
him at his home in Madison, New Jersey. Thomas said that he would
enjoy seeing Pavlov, but that he was currently preparing to leave on
a trip to the USSR and Europe and was not scheduled to return to the
US until late May. Thomas suggested that, in view of this, perhaps
early June would be a good time for them to plan on getting together.
Pavlov replied that he, himself would be in the USSR then, but would
contact Thomas when he returned in early suly- Incidentally, Pavlov's

Phone call to Thomas vas made on a pay phone. In fact, when the opera-

‘tor cut’ 4a for overtime, Thomas called Pavlov back at the pay phone.

Thomas mentioned that he Possibly might have the phone number written

“down. somevhere. .

4 efter the phone call from Pavlov, Thomas called John
McVicker $f the State Department and inquired if any clearance of
Pavlov's proposed trip to hie home in Madison would be necessary.
MeVicker told Thowas that any such clearances were Pavlov's worry
and that he need not be concerned about. same.

53. During bis recent trip to the USSR, it would appear that
Thomas was exposed to two incidents which possibly could have been
of opposition fabrication. One involved an approach by a Soviet
interpreter by the name of FRU Petrov, who took Thamss aside and
asked him if he could do him a personal favor by getting him a sub-
scription to National Geographic Magazine for which he, Petrov, would
reimburse Tkomas in rubles. Thomas politely refused. (Py fe sestny £30
“A enF est vesh
6. The other incident jnvolved Thomas ptt Se Notographed with:
attractive young fi inte: shkina. According
to Thomas, when one of the Soviete in their party war was about to take
4@ picture of him standing next to Ludmilla, another individual stand-
ing nearby vas pushed out of the way apparently so that he would not
be included in the photograps. In addition, Ludmilla attempted to .
strike an affectionate pose with Thomas for the photograph by slipping
her arm through his. Thomas claims to have pushed her arm away Just
as the photo was being snapped.

7. Assesament of Thoms: Subject strikes us as being extremely
naive and unrealistic. He appears to be more apprehensive about his
dealings with CIA than his dealings with Sovieta. In fact, when Thomas
was asked if he would mind if a tape recorder were used for debriefing,
he became very nervous and expressed a fear that, if such a tape vere

‘mada, perhaps the Soviets might gain access to it and use it aginet

him in some way at a future date.

Thomas had an outline in his own handwriting of the sessions of the |
Popov Society Meeting. When we asked for a photostat of same, he :
again expressed misgivings and indicated that he would prefer to have
a typewritten copy prepared for us instead of a copy in his ow hand-
vriting because ke was fearful that it might fall into Soviet hands. .

.! 1. I attended the Taint International Congreas on Aroustico, 1-8 Sapte oy,
Stuttgart, West Cernany.

2. While at this Congress I met a Soviet femle acientiut, L Chietovich,
who is connected with the Mavlov Inatitute of Physiology, Leningrad. -
One day during the Congress I took a walk in the Hlack Forest with
L Calatovich and another Soviet scientist. After a short tine, the
other Boviet acientist excuse! himuslf saying that he had t> rejoin

hie colleagues.

3. In Jume 1963 Manfred Schroeder, an acoustician with bell Telephone
Laboratories, vee in the USSR. On hin return tu the US he told me that
he had heard while in the USSH that L Chistovich, on her return Crom

the 1959 Stuttgart Congress, had been placed unler house arrest. He

also said that he had seen L Chistovich while he wan in the JSuR, anil
he had asked her’whether tt was true that she hai been placed unier
house arrest on returning from the Stuttyart “ongress. He raid
Chistovich's only reply was to blush,
