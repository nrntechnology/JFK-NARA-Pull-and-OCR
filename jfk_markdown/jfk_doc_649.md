below, which we plan to initiste on 1 June 1949. In view cf
the comment contained in psrsgrarh 2 of referenced communi -~

Cation, we ére assuming that ccazencenent of this project cn ;
a@ simple exploratory basis has already teen apprcved by head- : 1
Quarters. ho further ccmmitzeats, otier thea those descrited :
below, will be made, .

A. Objectives . . !

| FROM ‘ Chief of Station, Ssn José, Costa Rica

(1) Cutout services, as suggested by headquarters, - i
‘ in an effort to test Sudject's abilities.
f (2) As a basié end continuing assignnent to pernit - :
| Py and enccurege develcsnent cf Subdject's best : .
} ~ local contacts es we-l as in the hope of filling 1
8 long-felt need in cur operational béttiern, he . i
will be sssiened to the general topic of labor; j
specifically, communist penetrétion of local . i
non-communist labor croupds and theoretical
developments which are of interest regardless
of group designation. :

to possess an unusual appreciation for cpderational

ways and mesns, which is seldcm encountered.

For this reason, none of his assignments will

be exclusive, and he will be enccurssed to follow ‘
, up such leads end opportunities as erise in the . !

i B. Targets oe ° so

(1) Subject will Conmence by serving as cutout for , :
Hugger, who has always held out €reat promise but
never been properly developed or directed,

) In the labor field, the principal and ‘only terget
fet the moment {s the only lebor federation, the
‘Rerum Novarua,

! (3) Subject will represent our cnly contact among the
. student groups end certain allied "intellectual"
societies. Any sctivity in this category showing . ;
promise may subsequently become an assigned target. ol

C. Cryptonym end Essential Data on Personnel

The designation "Hydropathic", heretofore applied to

Subject individual, is hsreby discarded. He will

hergaéter be designated by San Jose Station Symbol

Now 25) For essential deta on personnel, see TZP-A-365,
and II. :

D. Control and Contect
zontrol and Contact

Judging by Subject's background data and his elreedy
denonstreted cooperative attitudes, we do not feel that
control and direction of his activities will be any
Problem. Contact, owing to the nature of this project,

A u will be frequent and carried out in any convenient ; :
j manner, generally in ome or the other of our respective . :
homes, !

B. Cover : i

i
|
i Subject had planned to and hes established himself in : .
| Costa Rica for entirely personal reasons, prior to any 5 i
contact with this office. He has a Costa Rican wife, o ,
| attends the university, and lives a perfectly normal :
life which any assignzeats from us will net disrupt, ,
Our only anticipated rroblem is that of mutine coatacts ‘
between Subject and the Chief of Station, at matter
will be handled with cere and discretion. Pt Crpios
ih

F. Cost Le dad
~~ ; aw 2.93
Subject has agreed to serve for @ salary equivalent to

$50.00 per month, to be paid in colones. To offset
this expense we plan to dispense with the services of

Hucklebone who is presently Teceiving $400.00 per xonth,

Our preliminary itoterviews with Subject lead us to : :
believe that he will be the interested and relis ble '
American cutout for which this station hes long felt
H a need. His grestest virtue in this respect appears’ . bof
to be an understanding of operational methods end an. * oe
appreciation of relative valws with respect to infor-
: ; mation. It 1s hoped to make this a permenent project,
ed. but our plens and our srrengemens. with: Subject are
. considered to be probationery, dependent entirely
upon his development and future usefulness,

TERMINATION SECRECY OATH

I, Ross L. Crozier . » am about to terminate ny
association with the Organization. I realize that, by virtue of my duties with
the Organization, I have been the recipient of information and intelligence which ;
concerns the present: and future’ security of our country. I am avare that the
unauthorized disclosure of such information is prohibited by the espionage laws

of our government which specifically requires the protection of intelligence
sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure, Accordingly, I SOLEMNLY SWEAR,
WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DURESS,

AS FOLLOWS:

1. I will never divulge, publish, or reveal by writing, word, conduct, or other-
wise, any information relating to the national defense and security and partic-
ularly information of this nature relating to intelligence sources, methods,
personnel, fiscal data, or security measures: to anyone, including, but not limited
to, any future governmental or private employer, private citizen, or government
employee or official without the express written consent of the Chief of the
Organization or his authorized representative. .

2. I have been invited to submit in writing any monetary claims I may have
against the Organization or our government which may in any way necessitate the
disclosure of information described herein. I have been advised that any such
claims will receive full legal consideration. In the event, however, that I am
not satisfied with the decisions of the Organization concerning any present or
future claims I may submit, I will not take any other action to obtain satisfac-
tion without prior written notice to the Organization, and then only in accordance
with such legal and security advice as the Organization vill Promptly furnish me,

3. I do not have any documents or materials in my possession, classified or un-
classified, which are the property of, or in custodial responsibility of the

On qualifications - there just aren't any in the
civilian or industrial category - The university work in
Economic Sciences was real, not cover, but interrupted before
I got the degree (5 years). However, I specialized in Economic
Theory, wrich when considered that I studied in three “atin
American Universities (Costa Rica, Guatemala and Cuba) does
give me some qualification as a. "Latin American Consultant".

The classfication as "Research Analyst" is cover excerpt
for that part of which the in American" backgro could
be utilized. TEESE a BE

Although I have had no business experience in an admidstrative ©

or executive capacity, I am sure that I could qpalify in that
work, especially if if were in connection with Latin America or
utilizing my Spa:.ish language ability.

As you can see by the above, unfortunately there is no
com :ercial "counterpart" for the type of work I heve been doing
for 15 years or more. My feeling is that we should consult the
"local outplacement” man first, on the possibility that there is
a local opportunity, but the opsortunities in the ~atin American
field whill be greater. :

{In acdition to the above, I might add that I have verformed
best in "operations" work"- which involves planning, direction.and
coordination.) : :

1, The Station would appreciate any information which Headquarters can
provide concerning an ETD for Harold R. NOEMAYR and his family and an
ETA for NOEMAYR's replacement, -NOEMAYR's tentative ETD of 1 January
1960 is only slightly more than one month away and he has visas to obtain in
addition to other departure preparations, see

2, NOEMAYR was instructed by the Station to proceed with the necessary
correspondence with Mexican, Costa Rican, Cuban, and Panamanian authorities
for the required police certificates for his wife since she is not a citizen of
PBF IME and is applying for an Immigrant Visa, He has already received the
necessary documents from Costa Rica and Cuba and expects to obtain the
Mexican certificate within the next two days. No reply from Panama has been
received as yet although it should arrive shortly, As soon as the Panamanian
clearance and that from Mexico is obtained, NOEMAYR will submit all papers
to the local ODACID installation and request the necessary documentation for
the travel of himself and his family, As Headquarters is aware, the Immigrant
Visa for NOEMAYR's wife will be valid only so long as she travels within four
months of the date issued,

3. An early reply to this dispatch would be appreciated.

Reference: HAVA 755

1, Distuseions of the whole problem of VAIVADA’s early TDY to Headquarters _
were held between the agent, the field case officer, and the Chief of Station on ;
13 and 14 January, as a result of which it becane clear that, unless Headquerters
has a compelling reason to the contrary, 1t would be advisable that the conten- H
Plated TDY be postponed until about the end of VAIVADA’s current contract year, an
i.e., the period of July-August 1957. :

2. A number of important personal problems dispose VIAVANA to accept the
delay in acquiring staff status that would accrue from such a postponement. His
wife is sufficiently 111 at this time from a form of nervous colitis as to recom-
mend that she not travel now. His children would have to-lose a semester of
their schooling since the current semester began on 7 January. Moreover as he
and family have resided in tropical areas for a number of years, VAIVADA would
have to make a rather large financial outlay to purchase needed winter clothing
for himself and his family which does nct seem justified for a period as short |
as two months. Owing to several routine but time-consuming inquiries being made
by the local ODACID in connection with his wife’s visa anplication, there is no
guarantee that VAIVADA would be able to depart Cuba before February 1957.

3. On the operational side, in spite of the original Station request that
VAIVADA’s trevel be expedited, advantages now of delaying his TDY outweieh the
disadvantages, from the Station’s point of view. Most imoortant of these is that
two promising sourzes currently under development by the Station, namely AMPHODARCH-
6 and APHODARCH-10, were originally contacted by VAIVADA and he has since been
the person working most closely with them. To substitute him with a relatively
untrained cut-out at this point in their development is not desirable, On the
basis of the original proposed timing of bis trip the Station has however proceeded.
with firm plans. to transfer handling of two other sources, AMPHODARCH-1 and AMBI-
VALENT-5, to a reliable P3PRIME cut-out. This plan can be initiated whether
VAIVADA departs now or later, and provides the ideal opportunity to take two low-
level sources off VAIVADA’s hands thereby freeing the latter to undertake new

development of specific student Commnist and Yeuth targets the Station has ;
already lined up, Both these sources have passed through an {nitial period of i
trainine and have fully demonstrated their reltabtlity and ability tocantinue i
to perform effectively via a cut-out. In handling a half-dozen sources, as :
VAIVADA has been doing, he reached the limits of reasonable span of eentrol and
has not had the time to give to such new developmental work which 4s his forte
and upon which 1t would be most desirable to have him concentrate rather than
upon the mere routine handling of relatively tested sources,

hk. Delaying VAIVADA’s TDY as Proposed herein would place VAIVADA at :
Headquarters at or about the end of his current contract year; where he would be H

interest in having VAIVADA reassigned to Habana for at least one additional year

if possible, and to note that VAIVADA has expre:sed a personal desire to that
effect, :

i
5. Regardless of the deciston as to timing of his travel, VAIVADA is i
Proceeding to change hia residence. He will try to obtain a suitable house :
Possessing a telephone, something he has lacked heretofore, thereby carrying

through plans previously reported to Headquarters in para-raph 6 of HKH-A-3lkh.

: 6. Therefore, unlesa there exist truly urgent reasons for VAIV:DA’s
: travel to Headcuarters Prior to about July 1957, it 4s recommended that his

trip be postpmed until that time,

“ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES oF

3. JMWAVE has reviewed the status of contract porsonnel

assigned to this station and has related the circunstances of

their assignment to that of staff apents with respect to the
application of the station housing allowance. Certain of these
contract personnel are not indigenous to this area, have*been .
transferred or assigned to JMHAVE froa other areas on the same
indefinite basis as staff agents, and suffer the same inconveninces
and uncertainties as staff agents which were recognized in the
. Headquarters approved housing policy. The rationale for granting
some degree of financial relief under these circumstances, in

the form of a housing allowance, is considered equally applicable
to these individuals. Gased on JMVAVE initlal survey of the

status of- contract personnel the station requests. that Headquarters
approve extension of the housing allowance to the following
individuals: f

f

HAROLD R. NOFMAYER PHILIP D. GLAVASCO
PETER J. DICERVENO IRVING C. DEVUONO
HENRY J. SLOMAN ALICE P, JENRETTE

IRVING G. CADICK
2. Upon approval JMHAVE will forward to Headquarters copies
of the proposed amended contracts and will pay and administer the
allowance in the same manner as is now applicable to staff agents.
