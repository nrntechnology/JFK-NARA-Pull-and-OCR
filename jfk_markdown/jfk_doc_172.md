MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General
SUBJECT “; Howard Hunt

1. At the recent request of the Deputy Director for - ;
Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched . -

its records to determine if we could find any payment to

Mr. Hunt in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required -
no accounting. | Ss oe, . es

2. We have searched the following records:

a. The expense runs for the period July. 1964 to.
- June 1973 for the immediate. Office of the DCI, _
the immediate Office of the DD/P, FI Staff, ~“*.
CI Staff, CA Staff and the Office of Security. —
We have checked various items that were re- . .
: ‘flected in these expense records but have
identified nothing relating to Mr. Hunt.

a IS- a 7

b.. The| Madrid Station, JMWAVE and FR/Washington
. Office acfountings to determine if there were

. funds passed by the Stations to Mr. Hunt during
the year he served under non-official cover in.
Madrid. We could find no payment to Mr. Hunt ‘
either in his true name or his two identified ««
pseudonyms. oO . eS

c. Mr. Hunt's travel claims for the period
: 1960-1972 and have found nothing in these
travel claims that were not consistent with .
normal travel expenses, i.e., transportation,” «
- per diem. . no , oe

d. We made a specific analysis of Mr. Hunt's
advance account for the period he was under

non-official cover (July '65-Sept '66) and have

determined that $33,500 was advanced to him
for travel and transportation of household
goods to and from Madrid with one trip to
Paris for he and his family to renew their = ;
Spanish visas. All of this advance was fully
accounted for. However, in his accounting, .
one item appeared unusual. It was an CL
expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive.  __ oo ;
operation which was approved for write-off by Mr. | So
- Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without ;
further accounting. 4

-- 3. Also, we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts: .
were established for Mr. Hunt during this period. ae ce

_. 4, At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it _
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The
_ BUR Division accordingly requested we open an account at the. |
Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr. Hunt's name to receive all non-_ ne,
‘salary payments. (Mr. Hunt had an account at Riggs National ~~ - Poe]
’ Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The. bE
following deposits were made to the account during 1965 and.
1966: . :

Account opened: 13 July 1965

13 July 1965 7 $10,000 :
a2 July 1965 5,000
15 September 1965 a 5,000 oe
6 October 1965. ~ + 5,000
‘19 July 1966 mo, 5,000

. $30,000.

All o£ the above have been accounted for by submission —

of travel and transportation accountings.

- 8. We feel at this time without specific guidelines that
further searching would be somewhat fruitless. One strange
aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that
all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the ;

. BUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people. -

“are usually assigned to a project...It is unusual to have as...

“case officer abroad for one year on-an operational ‘assignment -
without him incurring operational expenditures. =: | Le

SUBJECT: -Howard Hunt

6. The Office of Finance has not found operational
' expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above. ;
Therefore, it is suggested that: Mr. Karamessines be questioned
_as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational
expenditures if incurred . would have been charged.

7. Another possible. course of. act} jon is to request. the
Director to approve my asking la cleare at contact] at. Chase
. Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of all entries into.
. Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account. : .

; ' 8. We are currently reviewing records of all cashier's
checks prepared and issued by Monetary to determine if any - ,..
- were payable to Mr. Hunt. Hopefully this effort will be. ee
. £inished A by the end of the week.
