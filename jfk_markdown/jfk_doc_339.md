1. There are no traces on Cl
(201-357-029); born 21 April 1923 at|Gonaives, Haiti, who
ie President and General Manager of| the Commercial Dank of
Haiti, in RID or at the WH/Baitian ‘Desk. In March 1963,
Biographics, Register prepared a summary of information on
Mr. CHARLES for inclusion in the Biographic Intelligence
Report on Haitian Opposition Personalities, ‘This summary
ig made up of information obtained ‘from several different
sources. One source classifies CHARLES as ajislippery
eharacter who is active on the Haitian scene/and refers to
him as a "promoter" rather than a uusinessman, who endeavers

to attract United States "venture" capital for various
Haitian projects and then becomes a partner by virtue of

the promotion. Biographics Register ‘has a very high opinion
ef this Source, who is the State Department's Haiti Desk
Officer. During a. debriefirg on CHARLES, in) February 1963,
this same source stated that CHARLES |ia a confidant of
President Duvaiier.and that he hasiemerged as an active

businessman by virtue of his priv. aged position with the
t

President. .- 8 if
2, Another source of information regarding CHARLES'
business interests; is the President .of the National Bank of
Haiti who considers CHARLES, hinmsel?, as dishonest. For
example, according’ to Source, CHARLES approved a loan of
$14,000.00 on his daughter's signature alone. Algo, the -
GonmercialBank of Haiti held a worthless portfolic made wu

3. Attachéd to this memorandum is’:a copy of Department
of State Airgram No. 4-325, dated 16 February 1963, from ~
the United States Embassy, Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, subject:
Banking: Balance Sheet of the Banque Ommerciale d'Haiti'
which includes some information on CHARLE LESY life story. You
will note the comment in the last paragraph of Airgran A-325
that reads, ". . . Be all that as it may’, the Embassy has no
strongly adverse information concerning ‘Mr. Charles' integri-
ty or banking honesty.. And as the balance sheet shows, his
bank, if not thriving, is at least still a going concern.

4. It maybe that a check.with 00/C through Mr.
Schreyer's office and:a request ‘for field station traces will

as “Papa Doo's” {beaker ond financial: manager. Mr Charies, as vould
be expected is. “very close.to. ihe Palace” and has ready eccesa to
President Duvelier. As for his' character, he is described es "a
crook and a poor liar.” In other words, ir Charles is truly a Haitian
political charecter end not t'be trusted under any, conditions.

I nited that Mr Charles uentiond his activity in 1954 es @ negotiator
on behalf of the Enitian Goverment with the General Electric Co of -

As-a result of tis contract Tait experienced one of its greatest

‘pulitical ocandale for.the contract was for Us$4 millon, and the

actual delivery of products wao only US$1 million. I, likevise,
observed that Hr Charles io president of the Haitian Banana Corp -.
which we originally operated by Erie TMippenhauer and Colonel Prosper,
end subsequently was bankrupt beceuse of financial micmanugement.
Still further, Essential Oils Co was at one time the exclusive domin
