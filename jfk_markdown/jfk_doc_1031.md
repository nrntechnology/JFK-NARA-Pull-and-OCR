priefed, probably by both BISSELL and EDWARDS, on
the Phase I assassination plot run by Sheffield
EDWARDS and James O'CONNELL (Office of Security).

According to Dr. GUNN, HARVEY asked about the

pills he tested. Gunn briefed Harvey, who told

him to brief SIDNEY GOTTLIEB about techniques
but not targets. (27)

Pills given to ROSELLI by O'CONNELL are passed

_ to TRAFFICANTE. (27) ROSELLI reports to O'CONNELL
that pills reached ORTA in Cuba. ORTA returns

pills in couple weeks. (27)

O'CONNELL... gives, pills and money to ROSELLI who
passes them to VARONA. (32)

Bay of Pigs invasion fails; JFK appoints Taylor
Committee.

Beginning of PHASE II: BISSELL instructs HARVEY to
apply the ZRRIFLE assassination capability to .. .
Castro. (39) Harvey takes over the criminal syndicate
contacts developed in Phase I. (39) HARVEY is told

by HELMS that he is to take over the CIA Cuba

brief MC CONE (41). Harvey thereafter begins
regular reporting to Helms on. Phase II. (41)

HARVEY passes the pills to ROSELLI in Florida. (47)
Roselli was to give the pills to Varona, who had an
asset in Cuba with access to Castro's restaurant.

At this point Roselli is using Tony VARONA and
"MACEO" as contacts with Cuba rather than Trafficante.

©. (47-8)

HARVEY, with help of Ted SHACKLEY (Chief of JMWAVE
station in Miami), loaded arms and equipment in a
U-Haul truck which was left in a parking lot for
Roselli, who delivered it to a Cuban contact. (49- 50)

Intense contact between HARVEY and ROSELLI. Roselli
reports that pills are in Cuba at the restaurant
frequented by Castro awaiting | the opportunity to
use them, (50)

EDWARDS and HOUSTON brief ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT F.
KENNEDY on PHASE I of the assassination operation. (62a)#

Edwards tells HARVEY of.the briefing of RFK. (65)
Harvey says that he briefed HELMS about this and
advised against briefing McCone (DCI) or Carter
(DDCI); Helms agreed. (65

HARVEY is told by EDWARDS that the "tacit approval"
of the DCI should be obtained if Roselli was to be
used any further. (65) Harvey told Edwards that
Roselli would not be used any more. (According to
Edwards' memorandum of 5/14/62.) (42)

ROSELLI tells HARVEY that VARONA has sent three men
to Cuba to recruit others for the pill plot. (51)

Special Group (Augmented) meets on OPERATION MONGOOSE.
HARVEY and MC CONE said that McNAMARA raised the

_ subject of assassinations at this meeting in regard

to new plans.

General LANSDALE'S memorandum assigns to HARVEY the
drafting of an outline of intelligence, political,
economic, and paramilitary activities for the
implementation of MONGOOSE. The task includes
planning for "splitting the regime, including ligquida-
tion of leaders".

* RFK asks to be told before the CIA works with the Mafia again. (62a)

TOP SECRET

HARVEY writes a memorandum to DDP HELMS saying

that he advised Lansdale's aide FRANK HAND to

excise the words "including liquidation of leaders".
from the LANSDALE memo because of "the inadmissibility
and stupidity of putting this type of comment in
writing in such a document", Harvey also tells Helms
that he has “careful notes" on MC NAMARA'S discussion
of assassination at the Special Group meeting of
August 10. .

Pills still in place; HARVEY learns that VARONA is
ready to send another team to Cuba. (51)

CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS

HARVEY and ROSELLI agree in Los Angeles to call off
the operation, although not to break precipitously
with VARONA. (52)

‘HARVEY and ROSELLI have last dinner in Washington

and are observed by SAM PAPICH of the FBI, who has
ROSELLI under intensive surveillance. Harvey asks
Papich to let him know if HOOVER is going to call
MC CONE. (53-4) Harvey briefs Helms and Helms

agrees not_to brief McCone unless it appears that
McCone will receive a call from Hoover. (54)-

Spurred by a Chicago newspaper story of the same
day, HELMS sends MC CONE the Edwards memo of 5/14/62
of the RFK briefing. (69)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director (Plans)

SUBJECT

Operation MONGOOSE

1. Action, None. This memorandum is for your information,

2. Reference is made to our conversation on 13 August 1962,
concerning the memorandum of that date from General Lansdale,
Attached is a copy of this memorandum, excised from which are.
four words in the second line of the penultimate paragraph on
page 1. These four words were "including. liquidation. of leaders,"
3. The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel Castro,

Special Group (Augmented) in Secretary Rusk's oifice on 10 August,
It was the obvious consensus at that meeting, inanswertoa ~
comment by Mr. Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject which

has been made a matter of official record. I took careful notes on
the comments at this meeting on this point, and the Special Group
(Augmented) is not expecting any written comments or study on
this point, : : :

4. ‘Upon receipt of the attached memorandum, I called
Lansdale's office and, in his absence, pointed out to Frank Hand -
the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this type of comment in
writing in such a document. I advised Frank Hand that, as far
as CIA was concerned, we would write no document pertaining to
this and would participate in no open meeting discussing it, . a
I strongly urged Hand to recommend to Lansdale that he excise nl?
the phrase in question from all copies of this memorandum, in-,
cluding those disseminated to State, Defense, and USIA, Shortly
thereafter, Lansdale called back and left the message that
he agreed and that he had done so.

5. For your information also, in your absence and since .
the attached memorandum already had been distributed and in
view of the possibility that this might come to the Director's

_ attention, I informally briefed Walt Elder on the above.

i : Project ZRRIFLE-

l. Identification: The purpose of Project ZRRIFLE is to spot,
develop, and use agent assets for Division D operations. Agents will be
spotted in several areas, ‘including the United States, but for operational
security reasons will probably not be used in their countries of residence,
Present developmental activity is being conducted in the WE and EE areas,
but it is anticipated that this will be extended to other division areas. The
project will be operated against third-country installations and pers onnel,

2, “Objectives: The objective of this project is the procurement of
code and cipher materials, and information concerning such materials,
in accordance with requirements levied on the Clandestine Services,
primarily by the National Security Agency. Since these réquirements are
subject to frequent revision, no listing of targets would be valid for the
‘duration of the project. Specific operations will be mounted on the basis of
need and opportunity. The project will be conducted by Division D with
assistance from area divisions and stations as needed.

3. Background: In response to the increasing requirements for the
operational procurement of foreign code and cipher materials, Division D
in 1960 began the spotting of agent assets as a developmental activity.

During the same period requirements from NSA became more refined and in

many respects more sensitive, Because most stations are not equipped to

‘conduct this type of operation and because of the desirability of completely

control over this entire effort, it was determined that Division D, which is

in closest touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the

- activity. The spotting activity has now advanced far enough to justify

removing from the OOA category.

4, Operational Assets:

(1) Personnel: QJWIN is underwritten contract as a principal
agent, with the primary task of spotting agent candidates. QJWIN was first
contacted in 1958 through the Chief of the Luxembourg I.S. by the Chief of
Station, Luxembourg, in connection with an illegal narcotics operation into
the United States. For a period of a year and a half he was contacted |
sporadically by cos, Luxembourg, in behalf of the Bureau of Marcotics.
Files of this Bureau reflect an excellent performance by QJWIN. In
