L1- by. horns. wé explained to Subject. the delay: -A telegram’ nad been sent:
certain co Teagues” in Paris who Were supposed to write a letter to be for =
rded: te ‘Subject. The man: to whom tne telegram was. sent was on ‘leave -and upon
urn he’ waa not notified of the telegram we sent; consequently,’ Subject was not
infornied ashe should have been. We are terribly sorry and hope that Subject would
appreciate, such a minor matter..-In any. event, we reminded Subject that he had not
een promised a letter cn ‘or about 1 February but rather told that he could expect
2 hear from. us then. Subject agreed ‘this was - so. . .

oan Subject was far less interested in explanation than a decision. He rhetorically

asked whether he was accéptable, adding he was obliged to assume he was not, and
commenting that although there are “many “two legged: pecple in America also” he
thought he was probably a unique perscm from the point cf view of language ability,
experience as an operator in dangerous ‘sit tuations, etc. We replied thus: One man
(the psychologist): has already come’ all’ the way from the States just to see Subject
and -ariother was on: shis” way. From. this Subject could - fairly conelude the importance’
“Headquarters” ‘attaches: to Subject's candidature and that far from being a dead
‘issue, Subject" ‘s prospects were good, although all depended on him. .

. ke then turned. to the matter of Subject coming ‘to Paris. - Subject éxplained ©
that Paul ( ) had been sent by the Paris station
‘te ‘Annick: and had ‘not done very well. He had failed to convince Annick that he was
sent by Mike (Friganza) and apparently altholgh we did net go into tne details of .
this, he did net get the message straight. In any case Subject immedi ately said
that he c6uld come to Paris anytime although he would be cbliged.to travel
illegally. Thi bee use he had permitted his Identity decunent to expire as of 14
February 1959. wever, Subject feit he could make the journey by train without
being caught because the police are not checking most trains, He did not want to:
travel.by car ‘because. he had heard there are cccasional road blocks (this. may be
true for the undersigned ran inte cne.on the drive from Paris to Ambert). Subject
also said he eculd Stay as long’ as need by but it was absolutely essential that he
not be cbliged to stay at a hotel -- he could either stay with annick or at-a place
pat at his disposal. by us.

‘kind but profoundly selfish, but wtio would nevertheless give you the

family and was happy, when: he saw others happy. However, subject is con-

39. However, the question which arises in this examiner's mind is
why Subject panicked in his flight. It could have been that he un-.

to this aspect of ‘subject’ s personality as regards planning the project.

appear to be: his -so- called aéeident pronéness. He 1s ‘like the. cat in the
Disney film who, while chasing the mouse and, having his entire attention

“ dtrected to the catching and incorporation of the mouse, inadvertantly

gets himself run over by a truck. His first reaction to being splattered
by the truck is one of disappointment as regards not arriving: at the goal;
i.e., catching the. mouse. He thereupon. acts” ‘upon feelings of revenge en
the mouse for having caused, ‘his unfortunate accident. -In ‘addition, this,

. example signifies that Subject is iikely to keep his eye too much upon the
; geal: and. ‘insufficiently upon ‘the hazards involved in Feaching the goal. “It

may be argued that Slibject's philospphy in his past operations are related
in some manner to his lack of-attention to such details. His history is
that of the unlucky cat who manages to get himself run over sucessfully.

critical of himself din relation to. the superior. In other words, he would
Tike to be as useful as possible in, order ‘to. express his. loyalty, but “may

from AEPADDLE. Ee vas recruited in April 1959 by the Frankfurt Station,

ter psychological assessments and LCFUJPTER examination, it was decided
to recruit subject.. He was assigned the eryptol AEASPIC.) In April 1959

5. Security:

‘The: agent is very. security conscious and will follow &uy direction
in the interest of secuirty - : :

6. Control:

. Ca this point here are several aspects for consideration. Fe is

- under contract to us and although‘he is not too interested in money, he
does enjoy its benefits and realizes that it will continue so long as
he does.a good Job. The more. important built in control is the fact
that he will be under false documents, and being stateless, he is com-
pletely dependent on KUBARK to- perpetuate his quasi legal existence and
to eventually legalize his status. Added to’ this is the control which
stems from the prospect of. resettlement in another country. ‘This vould
give ‘hin status as a citizen. Realizing these points, subject is nore
than wilting to play ball with us. :

7. Prior contacts with ‘any security service:

As stated in 3B (2) above, the. only brush subject has ‘hed ia the
Past..was with Gestapo and French police. - These were prior to his re-
cruitment by KUBARK and were not as 4 resilt of I.S. activity.

8. Training of agent: | :

_ Re -had received training in covert black berder operations, In ad-
dition, he is being trained in small arms and demolition.

be made to pay this money back from his profits. After the loan is .
‘paid off, WIROGUE is to keep the profits he may make.

Re will initially transfer $1000.00 to a bank in Leopolavilie. We
. are certain that he will not abscond with the funds, since his docu-
‘mentation will be false and his pay and allownnces total $8500 per
annum, he would therefore stand to lose @ great deal more than he would
gain...

Being a ‘contract agent, there is ample control if he shows signs of
spending too much time in the pursuit of profits from his cover business.

His salary and allowsnces will be paid in part to a personal account
in Switzerland (separate from his business account). This money will
ostensibly also represent his savings. The remainder will be paid
directly at: “the station.

C. Security Estimate:

WIROGUE had beén recruited in France and exfiltrated black from West
_ Germany to SR/DOB. He has bad no kmown IS, connections in the past. He
“will ‘be surfaced in West Germany and will proceed to Leopoldville. He
will be documented as an Austrian .

“4. Background

The need for various technicians to stabilize the chaotic conait tons in
Leoroldville coupled with an urgent need for controlled assets in-that city gave
rise to this project... WIROGUB's particular talents, expertence, ability and
training open up & wide vartletyof possibilities,

“49 August 1960

: Agent ‘AEASPIG

le At 1400 hours; 19 “August, SR/DOB ease , officer;

Fred: Kirkpatrick and ‘Jerry. Pochron from Defection Coordinators .
: Office of CIA met with’ Clay Calendar and Jim Myers of TSD/IB
re-documentations ‘arrangements and travel routing for possible”
resettlement of. AESENTINEL agent AEASPIC. The following
arrangements were proposed by Mr. Caléndar and Mr. Myers
‘for SR/DOB's consideration. TSD/IB suggested that Subject be
sent by black flight from here to West Germany, and there

“ surfaced with an‘altered Greck passport which fSD/IB now has
-available. A suitable cover story would of course be incorporated
re the possession. of a Greek passport:-by Subject, while Subject -
has no. Greek language capability. Since this passport is a valid
_one, {and was, in fact, purchased by TSD/IB) and is therefore

on backstopped : in name, Subject could apply at the Mexican Embassy

in West Germany for a Mexican tourist visa by presenting this
passport. Once in Mexico, Subject could request emigration
action upon declaration of intent to become a Mexican citizen and
upon submitting proof of sponsorship by an employer in Mexico
City. -

2. Upon your concurrence, Mr, Pochron will arrange for
Mr. Kirkpatrick to.meet with Mr. Coolidge, the CLA contact used
for introducing agency designees into Mexican private industry.
Mr. Pochron has already talked.with Mr. Coolidge on two occasions
and has passed him Subject's file. From their talks, Mr. Pochron
has assured me that-this arrangement is entirely feasible, Gillete
Company of Mexico City being cited as one possibility.

3. AEASPIC would then openly proceed to purchase plane
tickets in West Germany for Mexico City and upon arrival there,
would be waiting for him: -The time table for this entire operation

- was estimated at about five’ weeks. Of course we did not discuss
Subject's monetary maintenance for the interim period.of travel,
‘hor until Subject could begin earning his own living.
24. Mr. Pochran expressed his concern and the concern
of Mr. Pennington of Alien Affairs Staff about the knowledgibility:
of Subject re pass. Agency. tie-in and. Agency assets. It will of |

-.¢oursé be our. job to assure Security that Subject is not knowledgable
: and will entail'a minimum of .risk.to-transport and: to resettle in
- Mexico.’ -In-view of this.concern; all arrangements offered for
-DOB's | sideration by TSD/IB were tailored to afford step by ~
:Step denial or participation by.the U. S, Government. In effect,
‘all items procured by Subject for: resettlement could just-as .
‘easily. be-obtaine he European black market as well as from

. this Government. abject williin effect be briefed and taken by
~German’ Station asget to, obtain his documents ostensibly on the

‘black market. Monies due Subject would be. withheld pending

. destination arrival, The letter head and Supporting sponsorship
documents to be used by. him for ultimate employment in Mexico
would be prepared. in such a manner as to be either legitimate or
forged. In addition it was suggested that Subject be closely ,
handled and advised by someone known to him to ensure the’
security aspect both to Subject and to this agency, :

5. The meeting was closed by TSD/IB's request to be
"informed whether these arrangements in theory meet with the
approval. of SR/DOB, and Office of Security. Mr, Kirkpatrick
was assured that Documentation aspects by TSD/IB could be
accomplished within one week upon ‘authorization by SR/DOB.
With your permission Fred Kirkpatrick will proceed to affirm
Mexican employment arrangements for AEASPIC.

1. This, will confirm recent discussions held between |
Mr. Fred Kirkpatrick of your Office and Mr. Lee Jungen of ny
Staff relative to the proposed W/T training of AEASPIC. As
was explained by Mr.. Jungen, ‘W/T training of an agent on &

pull or part-time basis, is contingent upon the approval of a”
_ specific project with supporting communications annex. While

we have on occasion participated in “holding” training of
agents without benefit of a definite requirenent, curreat
operational commitments now make this impossible. .

. 2. Should a definite requirement for the operational
“utilization of AEASPIC develop we will arrange for the w/t
aptitude -assessinent and training. Prior to our initiating
puch action, it is requested that a representative of your
Office discuss, operational details with en appropriate
Foreign Division within the office of Communications. This
will enable us to tailor subsequent training in terms of
specific equipment and procedures as required by the project.
In this respect, further information can be obtained vy
contacting Mr. Lawrence Eisler an extension 8137.
