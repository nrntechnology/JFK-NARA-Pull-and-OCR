TRAP

Londoners face a new hazard,
another plt in the treacherous bog
of regulations that surrounds
today’s law-respecling citizens.

‘This week, careful sidesteppers
along the narrow pathways of
rectitude learned that the phone
may lead to a fine.

In our public telephone boxes
are Pwo buttons; after the money
has clicked into the box and some,
sort of response ‘been evoked the
caller presscs Button A so that
the other end can hear him. If
he gets the wrong number or none
at."all he presses Dutton B and
gets his moncy dnd!
Sumetimes, the meehdhis.. ap-
pears to develop anlumisunl con-
trition tn_its behaviour find: pours
out a shower of coins. wikby in
execrss of the Button Bo presser’
due TH now, this pleasant quirk
has invested the dull business of
telephoning with a certun spert-
ing quality, No call is complete
without a hopeful linge at But-
ton B.

‘The other day, it seems, 9 youth
uyins to phéne his: pirt-friend
was getting no reply, which is
trouble enough, anyway Pressing
Button B, he was rewarded with
mghtpence, five more than he
wns entitled to If there's one sout
in the whole of London's ten
milion who wouldn't have pocket-
ed that extra fiveponce it certalnly:
wasn't our young swain, Unfort-
unately, somebody spotted his
transaction and the Ind eventuaily
found himself in court as wrong 3
number as anyone ever got.

They fined him ten shillings,
saying that he should have ret~
urned the other tivepence to the
box or a post-office. The author-
ues) explain that people who
forget to press Button B to regain
their money claim on the Post
Office and, therefore, snyone
pocketing money thus hurled at
them ts robbing the Postmaster
General. here may pessibly be
people who claim for the odd
forrotten threepence, but thus
column has never met even a
remate friend of one.

So something of the sport has
gone out of hfe. And a lot of
people are confratuinting uhem-
s‘lvrs on 4 natrow escape from

d@serace ‘There, but for the grace
af God.

‘The lad seems to have

FRANCE IN MOROCCO
= HERE hes always been d'scussion about the pecullar
trait of humen nature which f'nds oxpressicn in a feel-
fov of pleasure In contemplating the misfortunes of

others, Tho great Lucretius in his poem “De rerum natura”
tells of the satisfaction enjoyed in witnessing, from the safety

(> of the shore, the shipwrecked mariners struggling in the

sg: but he does not seem to have found anything reprehen-
© in ‘the sentiment. Nowadays we should, of course,

.indignantly deny any such baseness in ourselves, though

we may not be so sure about “the other fellow” who is quite
capable of putting a banana—skin on the path for our specla]
benefit. However this may be. it cannot be Iqnored that
the “foretgn” press tends to gleat over the difficulties of
Great Britain, formerly in India and Palestine, now in Iran
ond Egypt, conveniently forgett'ng the fact that no country

as being convincing evidence that. the great nations of
Europe, and the United States wih thom were in no way
disposed to accep! the concept of “the twilight of the Weat”
or to renounce thelr “mission civilistrice’.

How stands that Colonial Empire teday? It has to be
‘remembered that France, as a colonial power had a ‘great
asset shered by no other Western nation—-the absence cf

a rigid colour bar. The extending to “native” peoples of the
full rights cf French citizenship went beyond legal formulae;
mixed unions are not frewned on and “a touch of the tar
brush’—or of yellow pain! in the Fer East, conveys no stigma.
whatever other handicaps may have to be oveicome.
Moreover, colonial France has called forth the energy, and
“in not a-few cases, the genius of great soldters and admia-
‘Istrators, second to none, and whateyer may happen in the

the=ficcleur still flies over many lands and over millions
