MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
RETURN To CIA

. ‘ ckground Use
SUBJECT: Herbert Itkin Do Not Reproduce!

1. A meeting was held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.

Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications

of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.

It was concluded that additional information was required on
03(Thomas Le Roberts) and (Robert Delsog.°> 1 contacted the Director

of Security and requested the security files on these two individuals

and was advised that we could not have the security files but that

Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss

their contents openly,

03 2, On 29 Fanuary, Mr. Greene brought the security files
on (Roberts) and elson) and was most cooperative in explaining
their contents, “Attached is a chronological rundown on the
pertinent information on (homas L. Roberts} affiliation with
the FBI, CIA and Itkin. 03

3. On 30 January a *reeting was held°with Messrs. Houston,
Warner, Rocca, and fugene Milligan), ccs /LPGLOBE, to discuss
the operational use of Mr. Roberts, Mr obert9) has been a
Staff Agent of CIA since 3B August 1961, From March 1964 to
alpyember 1964 he spent time in (West Afric writing a monograph
on (West African legal)problems. /° It should “be noted that this
task was performed under a grant from a foundation which was
blown in the MHDOWEL exposures. In November 1964 Roberts) oF
was assigned for Cover to the(Radio Corporation of America zy
legal) staff where he remained until March 1965 and then went
to (@aka?,

4, The facts in the attached chronology are subject to
question since they are the result of (Roberts} own explanation of
his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from
independent sources, The most critical aspect would appear to
be the owledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of

O Roberts affiliation with CIA. This knowledge is borne out by

03

( 2pf

the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly bring? oberts¥ name
into the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations.

One of the questions to be. answered by @PGLOBE personnel is
whether or not (Robe2ts) reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva,
Switzerland, in March 1966. There appears to be no record of

(Roberts having explained why he never pursued the Itkin debt or

what his financial contribution was to the (law firm of Itkin, Robertso&
and Greenbaum.)

5. Mr. Rocca was advised by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI
that the New, York District Attorney may be considering prosecution
against Rovéeey for having absconded with funds received from
negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate
the likelihood of criminal prosecution. It may be necessary to
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office,

Pe)

6. With regard to Robert Debsos) there appear to have been
two operational considerations, one having been a request to use
him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations
Division for his use on Project WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO
Division advised Security that (Delson was not going to be used
on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca comniénted that there are some rather
ominous allegations against members of the firm of (Delson, Levinu&S
and Gordon)) indicating that one member of the firm was a card-
carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time
Mr. Rocca is investigating the DITPILLAR use of Mr. (Belson)
