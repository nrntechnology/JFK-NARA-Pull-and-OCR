ACTON RRQ - CEES

1, For your information, we no longer carry Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV
(201-779495), guard at the Soviet Embassy in Tehran, as PCS, He was not listed
on ROGWEN's April 1971 Presence List nor their December 1971 list, We assume
he has departed PCS,

2. During OBYEDKOV's tour in Tehran his wife, Yelena, served as principal
at the Soviet school. His som was apparently in Moscow living with Yelena's mother,
On 23 October 1969, ROARC reported the grandmother calling to.check with OBYEDKOV
regarding a tutor for the child, They discussed the possibility of the tutor coming

for three times a week, at five rubles per hour, but OBYEDKOV, after checking with
his wife, decided on two times a week, OBYEDKOV seemed to be very fond of his
mother-in-law, According to our AESCREEN transcriber, she was the only one that

could tel OBYEDKOV what to do,

3. The following are comments made by our AESCREEN transcriber on OBYEDKOV
on 8 July 1970;

“He fs very security conscious, especially in dealing with "official people” or
superiors, He mentions his name to his friends freely, but refuses to say his name
when ke knows that one of the superiors is calling, “this is the duty officer” OBYEDKOV

- would say several times, He often lectures people when they violate security regulations
when talking on the telephone. OBYEDKOV has to be persuaded several times or even

ae appears better educated that his duties as a guard would
demand, because he seems financially better off than other
Soviet guards and because of his apparent association on
equal footing with Soviet RIS officers, DERYABIN in 1955
advised LNERGO that the surname OBYEDKOV was familiar to him
as the name of a person who was in the Guards Directorate of

|
i

the MVD in 1951, | —
In September 1967 DERYABIN and RASTVOROV said that they /

neither recognized the face nor the name of the Subject.

(Both Ivan Ivanovich and Ivan Dmitriyevich were seén by the |

defectors and they did not recognize either of them.) |

B. MEXI-4485, 19 August 1965

1. Reference A reported the departure of Subject from Mexico on 4 August
1965, The Station now believes that Subject departed PCS, and that he has possibly
been replaced by Ivan Petrovich KARCHIN, whose arrival on 14 August 1965 was

reported in Reference B,

2. According to LIENVOY, KARCHIN has been answering the telephone at the
Soviet Enbassy, a duty for which Subject was. previously responsible, According
to LICALLA, KARCHIN has also been taking guard duty at the entrance gate to the
Soviet Embassy, which Subject also had as one of his duties.

2. In addition, LIENVOY reported that on 17 Auguse 1965 that "a new school
director" had arrived at the Soviet Embassy. OBYEDKOVA' had previously been the
director of the Soviet school in Mexico, and the fact that she had been replaced
indicates that she will not return to Mexico. The identity of the new school
director has not been established, although it may be XARCHINA,

. 4. The attached Soviet Pergonality Report (SPR) on Subject represents

@ summary of Station information on him. It is noted that Subject is listed as
guspect RIS, service unknown, his previous designation as suspect KGB was based
primarily on his presumed identity with the subject of 201-121531, which has now
been established aa incorrect. -

‘Although Subject acted as a guard at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico, he
appeared to be fuirly well educated and was not subservient to any of

the other Soviets, with the exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich
KAZANTSEV (201-028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be
helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy Stepanovich VISKO
with her arithmetic homework, On another, Subject was asked about methods
of producing metal wire, a subject on which Subject was well informed as
a result of his having once worked for a wire factory (1).

: Subject had a tape recorder at home which he Likedto listen to. He also
: no occasionally went fishing with other Soviets (1).

Subject told "Boris" /paragraph 7c‘above/ in Moscow to build a large
garage, because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also asked
wheter "Boria" had bought a refrigerator and TV for the apartment. On
another occasion he was negotiating for a can of paint to take back to
Moscow with him to repaint “the Moskvich." Subject and his wife were

: both buying watches just before leaving Mexico. (1). /From the above it
.f appears that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard/.

hovever, because Subject appears better educated than his duties-as a guard would

he is considered suspect RIS, It is further noted that Subject's predecessor was

suspect GRU.

1, Weadquarters agrees that Subject i3 probably not identical with
Ivan Lvanovich OBYEDKOV (20f-121531) as was earlier believed, and has
accordingly assigned ivan tmttriyevich 201-779498 . A full Headquarters
trace under that name tirrned up no informstion other than that originating
from Mexico Lity Statien, which has now been re-classified into the new
file, We age puzzled by the fact that MERXL-1850, dated | Septenbder 1962, the
first piece of correspondance from Mexico City Staticn on Subject, reported

him as Ivan Ivanovich,

2. A photo comparison of the two individuals in this case is not
satisfactory proof that they éx ia fact two people because of the difference
{n years and exposure in the photographs. The pre-Mexico City traces on
Ivan Lvanovich reflect only a date and place of birth as identifying data.

It is hoped that Mexico City Station can obtain soon identifying biographic’
data on Ivan Daitriyevich in order to firmly resolve the matter. :
