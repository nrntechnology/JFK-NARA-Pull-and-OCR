Stan,

Feteral Bureau of Investigation :
Attention: ‘Hr. 8. J. Papich : bo . 1

¥\9)

PROM +: Deputy Director for Plens i
SUBJECI® Lyle STUART

Reference is made to your menorandus dated ] June 1964,
in which you provided this office with several questions you
gighed to have passed to Miss Viola June COBB regarding
Lyte STUART. There Yoliovs the information provided by
= RET bm meow te Wit inquiry:

1. Regarding Lyle STUART, Juan Jose AREVALO, and i
Antikomuntsra em Asesica Latina: _ . ; : i
Early im the spring of i962, in Bexico, AREVALA told
we that STUART wus prodding hiss about getting another of his
ed, to take advantage of the publicity around
‘i hark © the Sardines 1 was already tar beyors
Bpcahing teras with Bis und therefore declined to have
anything further to do th bin. About three months later,
ARZVALO told mo that BIUART was going to puplish
Antixozunisne en America as. and that a young Anericaa
Student, married to @ Bexican, Angela delli SAXTB ABROCHA
(gio bad written Arevalo, pauunder conten ranco, ywudslished
by Comte Awic, 1964, financed by Alg £2 evolucionario
de El Salvador) was doing the translation into English.
Early 1m 2565, AREVALO told me that the translation badz't
been gatisfectory and therefore STUAKT had obtained 9 re-
trenslation, by Charleton BEALS. :

When STUART was here in Hexico in June, he told
Dr. OSRGUEDA that he was very happy sbout the way the book
was selling. : ;

Yrasmuch as STUART haa paid AREVALO only 10 per cent

of moneys received by STUART on the Shark aad the Sardiace a \
gales (in contrast with sore book contracts in which the author {
receives 10 per cent of the money represented by nunber of
copies seid multiplied by the retaih seles price) i would
agauae he i6 uO Bore gencrous Sith Ant Lkomnisao. ;

14-00000

I know of no affiliations of STUART with foreign

political parties of government. His attempts to get cicse
to Fidel CASTRO in 1960 were motivated by a desire to exproit
the journalistic advantages of an interview. His original :
interest in The Shark end the Sardines was apparently :
motivated by money-making {ntercats ond by the hope that
he might spark a sensation - exactly what he did manage to

- do with hia outrageous advertising. He geened to calculate
that there might be libel suits possible sgainst the firag
and the newspapers he could provoke to attack hin.

The original contract of AREVALO with STUART was
superseded by another in Novenber of 1961, granting STUA&T
certain rights witha regard to other foreign language editions
, of The Sherk and the Sardines and, I believe, establishing

suet CRTT ET cenntd bawe Fiver antian aw ather ARKVALO booka

translated into English. t

Information about STUART's dealings with AREVALO
and whatever othera, could be obtained (with guiie) fron v
. Edleen BRANT, who was ils eriitor at the tine of the firet
‘contact with ABEVALO, She subsequently broke with hin
because of deep and bitter resentment against him, then .
returned not too long ago to collaborate vith hiz. She igs - 4
‘Ris wife's sister. She is certainly working with him now ;
snly because he finally offered her a little better pay. FPor~ ad
her to have changed her sind about him vould be almost i
impossille, I believe, in view of the long history of tucideats 4
that had brought her to have contempt for hin, at the tine :
I knew her.ia 1961. She knows his operation inside-out. i
ln order te get information from her, it would be absolutely
necessary to approach her from some angle that would give 3
no hint of government investigation. She is very gregarious. *
Ehe ia a fortyish medium-attractive, lonely, New York single
woman (unless her status has changed since i knew ber). If
contacted by somebody she would assume to be a writer, nad
who would be a bit friendly with her and see her off-hours,
she vould probably talk freely about STUART. But ehe is :#
quite clever and rather worldly in some respects, So that must :
be kept in mind in case she 18 contacted. SHE HAS A VERY i
DEEP AND LONGTINE NEGATIVE “ATTITUDE, TOWARD ALL GOVEBNENT $

2. Regarding. Lyle. STUART, Dr. Baul OSECURDA, Bartolome >
COGTA Amic, and Mario EONTEFORTE Toledo: oo

Dr. OSEGUEDA apparently has had a secret longing to
ect something of his owB printed in English. He geized upen
the opportunity of commenting BEALS’ introduction ts

LYLE STUART
AREVALO . < :

Barly in the spring of 1962, here in Mexico, Arévalo told me thet Stuart
wes prodding him abozt getting ansther of his books translated, to take ad-
vantege of the publicity around “The Thark ani the Sartines". I was already
far beyond speaking veras with Stuert and therefore declined to have anything
further to do with kin. About three months ieter, Arévalo told me that Start
vas going to publiés “Antikomicisso en Americe Latina” and that a young Acerican
student, married to & Mexican, Angela delli Sente Arrocha {who hed vritten
"Arevalo, Fensador Ccntemporaneo";* was doing the tranalstion into English,
Barly in 1363, Arévelo told me thst the transiation hadn't been satisfactory
and therefore Stuart had obtained 6 re-translation, by Cherleton Beals.

_ When Stuart wes rere in Mexico in June, he told Dr. Oseeueda that he was
very happy about the wey the pock vas selling. 7

Inasmaich as Stuezt has paid brévale only 10 percent of moneys received by
Stuart on “The Starz and the Saricnes” sales (in contrast with some book con-
tracts in which the author receives 10 percent of the money represented by ©
munber of copies sold multiplied ty the retet> gales price) I would assume he
is no sore generous with "antikommiamo", I cen esk Dr. Oseguede the exact
terms, but I haven't been able to see Osegueda this veek.

‘I know of no affiliations of Stuart with foreign political parties of
governnent. His attempts to get close to Ficel Castro in 1960 were motivated
by a desire to explicit the journalistic advantezes of an interview. Ais:
original interest in "The Shart 2d the Sardines" was. apparently. motivated by.
money-saxing intercs~ and by the hope thet he might sperk a sensation - exactly”
what he did manage <o do with bis outrageous edvertising. He seemed to calcu-
late that there might be libel suits possible egainst the firms and the news-
papers he could provoke to attack him. . .

X as gure you tave it on file, but Iwill enclose a copy of Arevalo’
original contract vith Stuart. It was superceded by another in Novenbe> of
1961, granting Stuert certain rishts with regard to other foreign language
editions of "The Shark and the Sardines" and, I belfeve, establishing that
Stuart should have first option of other Arévalo books translated into English.

be obtained WITH GUILE from Eileen Brant, who vas bis editor at the time. of the

Lyle Stuart

Dr. Raul Osegueda
Bertolome Costa Amic
Mario Monteforte Toledo

Dr. Osegueda apparently has hed a secret longing to get something of his

‘own printed in English. He seized upon the opporcunity of cormenting Seals'

introduction to "Antikom:niemo” in crier to wrive to Stuart this spring. Stuart
wrote very cordially back to Osegueda, hoping to zest him on a trip to Mexico
in June. When Osegueda confessed to ze his correspondence with Stuart, he
sought to make me see it as an attexpt to speak with Stuart about the royalties
Stuart has never paid me.

When Osegueda finally did see Stuart here during the book congress in June,
he only very timidly and very, very triefly touched upon the royalty groblem, end

‘{ndeed went to a great deal of trouble to serve Stuart by introducing aim to

Costa Amic and to Mario Monteforte Toledo. (Stuart had expressed interest in ©
getting in touch with some publisters and writers.) Oseguede bustled shat,
taking Osegueds and Monteforte Toledo to lunch vith Stuart, even maneged to get
the Monteforte Toledos to invite Scuert to dinner at their epartment. Tnere —
were tentetive discussions of collaborating in the distribution of Costa Amic ©
pooks. in. the United. States and of publishing some book of Monteforte Toleto's.

. However, both Costa Amica end the Honteforte Toledos tola re that they
found Stuart offensively vulgar and vere pot at all enthusiastic about having

anything to do with him, 3
‘No weeks ago, Csegueda sketched tne outiine of @ book (coatemporeary history

of U.S. and Latin American reletions) he hopes Stuart will want to publish, and
sent the outline up to him. :

to determine if the subject has violated the Registration Act. His
firs published the 1964 Americen ec.tion of the book entitled, "Anti-
Comsunism in Latin America,” written by Juan Jose Arevalo, former :
President of Guatemala. The nature and extent of subject's relationship
with Arevalo is therefore pertinent to our investigation. :

‘As you know, Viola June Cobb, known to your agency, personally
knows Arevalo and worked with him on the translation of his book, "The
Shark and the Sardine.” It is therefore possible that Cobb may be in
@ position to furnish some information which can be of assistance to
this Bureau. We would appreciate if your agency vould interview Cobb
and endeavor to obtain answers to the following: :

| (1) What information does she have concerning the relation-
ship between the subject anc Arevaio regaraing tae ovon, “Autint meee
in latin Anecrica"? ,

(2) Does she have any information indicating that subject.
is in any way affiliated with foreign political parties or governnents?

. (3) Does she knov of any contractual agreement existing
between subject and Arevalo or between subject and any other foreign:
principals?

(4) Does she know of anyone elss who may be in a position
to furnish information concerning subject? .

(5) In the event that Cobb is in a position to furnish infor-
mation concerning any of the above points, we desire to be-informed if
abe would be willing to testizy in court. A

REF: HMMA-22258

1. LYCOOKY-1 was granted an OA on 27 January 1964 for use as
outlined in the P8Q II forwarded with HuMA-22758. The OA as
granted, however, was restricted to approval to use LICOOKY-1 in .
such a manner that information is taken from her, but that as little
classified information as possible is to be passed. Specific
requirements should be passed only when necessary, and should be
mace in such a mann. that sensitive operational or ODYOKE programs,
Plans, and objectives are not revealed. The office granting the
OA also indiczted that the limitations proposed in the Station's .
comments in Section XVI of the PZQ Il should be. implemented.

2. If LICOOXY-1 is ever to be used as a directed and fully
controlled asset, without the limiations expressed above, an .
amendment to the OA will be necessary. .

{

3. Reference is made to Section 4, para 1 of the PRQ IT
forwarded in ref, which indicates that LICOOXY-1 may be given a
bonus for a particularly outstanding joo. The Station is reminded
that since LICOOZY-1 is a Contract Agent, and PBPRIX® citizen,
her contract must be amended each time 4 bonus payment is
contemplated.
