volume, page by page?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir.

Mr. Klein. Did you go through any of the other volumes?
Mr. Nosenko. No, sir. .

Mr. Klein. You told us that an officer named Matveev

Mr. Nosenko. Right.

Mr. Klein. Do you know who wrote that summary?

Mr. Klein. Do you know who, in particular?
Mr. Nosenko. No, sir, I do not know.

Mr. Klein. And did you ever have an opportunity to read

Mr. Klein. The Russian word “spravka", does that mean -
Mr. Nosenko. Is summary, right.

Mr. Klein. And why were you not able to read the summa

Mr. Nosenko. Well, the file was taken in the First

Department. I was working in the Seventh Department.

Mr. Klein. Did you make any attempt to read it?

Mr. Nosenko. It was the decision of the Chief of the

Second Chief Directorate, given big importance to this questign,

that a resume will be prepared by the most prestigious depart+
ment, American Department, and that is why we couldn't even aa.

Mr. Klein. So it was not unusual that you were not

of the employees, one of the workers, who was helping to or-

and promotions when they induced people to recruit?

Mr .Nosenko. Right.

| Mr. Klein. And despite that, Lee Harvey Oswald, when |
1G | he asked to defect, you turned him down without even speaking} to
a? him, to find out if he had any information; is that right?

students, -but“particularly ‘those students who are studying

“the Russian language, Russian ‘history, Russian economy.

Mr. Klein. And would they have any interest in an

professed Marxist? Would they have any interest in that

kind of person?

b
i
|
|
|
Mr. Nosenko. Here were are coming to a very interesting

[ i
1
'
i
t
{
i

American who had strong anti-American views and who was a |
|
i
| .
and sensitive question. From mid-1950, by the order of '

Central Committee Communist Party, Soviet Union, KGB was
prohibited to make any approachment and recruitment of

!
Members of the Communist Party of the West.

Mr. Klein. I am not asking about a member of the
|

Communist Party.
;
|
Mr. Nosenko. Your question is, and if he. is some type

of Marxist here, the question maybe he is possibly a member

of Communist tParty, and to check it for KGB very difficult

if he is a member of !Communist Party or not of his country.

Mr. Klein. Would they ask him if he is a member of

the Communist Party? :

|
Would they check it?

Mr. Nosenko. No, they would not ask him.

Mr. Klein. They wouldn't ask him?

i
i
Mr. Nosenko. No.

Mr. Klein. Would the Soviet Union be interested in

someone who was in the military and worked with radar equipment?

Mr. Nosenko. It depends. If he was corporal, private,

is no big interest. If he was officer, maybe they would be ,

cy

interested. “

ue

Mr. Klein. The jfact that he worked with the equipment

de

| wouldn't be enough; they would want to know what his rank was

ba nn nen ae en nna

S| .

| Mr. Nosenko. No, sir; it is not enough because they

7 had sources.

5 | Mr. Klein. And in ‘1959 would the Soviet Union. have been

sl interested in someone who served as a radar operator on an air

o base where U-2s took off and landed? |
4 Mr. Nosenko. . Yes, sir; it would be very interested.

2 Mr. Klein, It.is your testimony that Lee Harvey Oswald,|-

Q . . 3 | who was a student, who was a professed Marxist, who had -- ;
i Mr. Nosenio. Students? -I never heard that he was a

student.
Mr. Klein. -- who had been a radar operator and had

‘| worked on a base from which U-2 airplanes took off and _ i

landed, that he. wasn't even interesting enough for the KGB

for KGB to snow about such base -- that base. We knew it
in '50's when I worked in GRU at the Navy, in 1950, '51, '52.
We knew every base and in Japan, at this Atsugi Base, and we

knew what kind of airplanes had been. We didn't know about

U-2, no. Sure, it is very interesting, but when Oswald
applied, requested to stay in the Soviet Union, ,we didn't kno
-a word about his knowledge, anything concerning U-2 flights. |

Mr. Klein. And you didn't ask him if he had any kind of!
information about that when he wanted to defect, is that i
correct?

. Mr. Nosenko. No.
Mr. Klein. And you told us that one reason that no .one

i

was working on Oswald was because all of your people were

concentrating on the American Exhibition in 1959, is that
correct?

.Mr. Nosenko. , Yes, sir. Not only American, Exhibition,
there were other ‘tourists and among them were interesting
‘targets, very interesting targets.

Mr. Klein. You told us yesterday that things didn't -- |

Mr. Nosenko. I can explain you why, because ‘an american
Exhibition in Moscow was by the information which’ KGB had,
I don't know how much it's right, how much it's ‘wrong, but it
was suspected quite a number of people from American intelli-!
gence community who were working on American Exhibition in

Moscow, and when the work is going on against such targets,

Mr. Nosenko. Well, I meaning fair ended when left all
the “people. involved in work on American Exhibition, Americans
when they left,’ and they were staying quite a long time
after it was closed. It was closed for visits for Soviet
citizens, but. it took quite o time for them to leave.

individual to marry a Soviet woman, and then this mentally

Soviet citizens.with foreign. A foreigner can marry a Soviet;

citizen, by the law, There is not a thing that KGB can in any

way try not to give, not to make it possible, but this is in

Ww

cases when the person who is marrying a foreigner worked in

aa

some sensitive place, let's say, in missiles, rocket

i || industry production, was in process of .any place of his workr
ing seeing classified material. In these cases, KGB will try

, | to put different type of fences. But it is uniawful. In

‘Mr. Klein. You testified that not only was Oswald not
spoken to when he first said he wanted to defect but even aftér

the decision was made to allow him to remain in the Soviet

12 Union, still nobody from the KGB spoke to him, is that correct?

Is that typical way that a a@efector would be treated in

Mr. Nosenko. Every defector will be watched but, sir,
when you mentioned what he received being in Russia, it is very
little. I can give you only one example. When defectors
Martin ‘and Mitchell, employees of NSA, who cooperated with KGB

abroad, and then they defected to Soviet Union, they received

extraordinary help. It is not like Oswald. Oswald is nothing.

Mr. Preyer. The amount of money?

Mr. Nosenko. The amount of money and other things,
extroardinary.

Mr. preyer. For Oswald were not extraordinary?

Mr. Nosenko. No.

Mr. Preyer. You mentioned the other three defectors that
you had known of. What sort of treatment did they receive?

Mr. Nosenko. I will tell you what Martin and Mitchell --

Mr. Preyer. were they two of the other three?

Mr. Nosenko. These two, for example. I can mention others,
what I heard, I never work with them, what I heard. Martin

and Mitchell, by decision of ‘Soviet Government was given them,

up to death. And each one was helped with work. Both were

assignéd with:.some .type.of- research: work..where they had given

But amount of pay of his was analogical to the amount of pay

of the Director of this Institute, besides what he is

Mr..Devine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Were you solicited to be a defector?

Mr. Nosenko. No, sir. No, sir..

Mr. Devine. Why did you defect?

Mr. Nosenko. I défected because I. for years of my life

has come to number of conclusions that. the whole society, the

whole system, is dictatorial system, nondemocratic system,
the true police state system, and especially working the
KGB opened eyes for me. My defection was strictly on ideologi
cal basis.
Mr. Devine. Had you been out of the Soviet Union prior |
to your defection?
Mr. Nosenko. Yes.
Mr. Devine. Other than’ to. Geneva? :
Mr. Nosenko. ves, I was in England twice, then I was
passing through a number of. countries, staying day, two,
France, Belgium, HOlland. I was in 1960: in Cuba.

Mr. Devine. You were a married man in” Russia? -

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir.

Mr. Devine. Had a child?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, two daughters. : _

Mr. Devine. Were you having some domestic difficulties?
Mr. Nosenko. No. I tried in 1960-'61, I tried to arrange |
to go to work abroad with my family, and in the last moment

it:fell down, and I understood I cannot go abroad with ‘family,

UP SECRET ae

and that is why when I contacted CIA in '62, I =- psychologicall

I was ready, ideologically was ready and psychologically ready
to defect, but. the question of family was bothering me.

Mr. Devine. But not enough to keep you there?

Mr. Nosenko. Not enough to keep me there. And in '64
I has come knowing that I will never return.

Mx. Devine. You were willing to abandon your family?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir, because I didn't see possibility

to take family out. I was living the last four or five years

fas a man with two souls, splitted personality, one I must show
and was showing, as good KGB officer, as a good Communist, as

{a patriot of the Soviet system, the Soviet Union, and the other

| part of me, the true part I am not believing in what I am

itelling, I am not believing in the system, I do not like it,
iT do not want it, and I consider what phony things are going
jon because I was working in KGB, I knew it. I simply couldn't
| more tolerate to be with this double splitted personality.

Mr. Devine. How did you dispose of your children and your
wife in Russia?

Mr. Nosenko. The thing was psychologically, my had, had
in my mind. help me. My mother was rather rich, after death of |
father, she was very rich woman and she had a lot that will be

| enough not only for my children but their children and grand-

children. From the point of view of material they will never

Mr. Devine. Yes,but as a defector would there not be
reprisals taken by the Soviet Union against your family?
Mr. Nosenko. sir, before the death of Stalin it could
be taken drastic measures against the family, but after the
death of Stalin, from middle 1950s, quite a little changes took
place in the Soviet Union, and: the family will not suffer.
Another thing, oh sure, wild be certain things. which they
cannot achieve. Let's say my brother who studied later in
the same Institute what I finish, Institute of International
Relations, he will never have possibility to go. abroad, but
he will never ‘be put in jail, can never be exiled from Moscow,
the same, nothing happened with family.
Mr. Devine. The fact that you were a KGB man didn't your
defection catise some irritation among those in power over there
Mr. Nosenko. Sure.
Mr. Devine. Did they want to get you back, didn't they
want to get even with you?
Mr. Nosenko. Oh, yes, and they are looking for me.
Mr. Devine. But they took no reprisals against your famil
Mr. Nosenko. No.
Mr. Devine. How do you know that?
Mr. Nosenko. Well, I do not know exactly, but you see, |
there were some defections before. The family didn't suffer Like
it was, let's say, in '40s and maybe up to death of Stalin.
Mr. Devine. Were those KGB defections?

Mr. Sawyer. But he might have been a cryptographer in the

Marine Corps. He might have been as an enlisted man, he
might have been a eryptographer and know all our codes and
code methodology that might help break codes and that sort of
thing, but nobody ever asked him. That is what I don't under-
stand. And I can't believe it, very frankly.

Mr. Nosenko. I understand, sir, but I am telling you he
wasn't considered interesting target, and ~~

Mr. Sawyer. But they didn't have any facts to know
whether he was interesting, and here is a guy that wants to
talk to them.

Mr. Nosenko. But the judgment made on each person to work
actively against him on the basis of his questionnaire.

in questionnaire will be said he is, let's say, professor,

department, but for the Federal Government, or he is an officer
sure, on him will be paid attention.
Mr. Sawyer. Well, all right, we can drop that ‘for a

teacher, let's say he is working for the government, any
minute.

But now, he got a visa’'in two days in Finland. I happen
to have been in Finland four years ago and wanted to get a
visa, a sort of a last minute decision, to go to Leningrad, and
I was told there is a minimum of 30 days before you can get a
visa. Now, to issue him a visa in two days for Russia, that

is very unusual, apparently, so they must have had some

interest in getting him there. >

Mr. Nosenko. Sir, what I know, there wasn't any interest
to get him. He managed to get this visa.
Mr. Sawyer. All right. .
The other thing I am curious about is when they interrogated

you so carefully here, why someone like Oswald, a known defecto

and who could well have been now a Russian intelligence agent,
comes back to the country, apparently CIA .or FBI, or nobody
paid a bit of attention to him, andilet him wander around the

country with a Russian wife at will.

ry These are the items which I have picked up in the last

two days that,.would .tend to lead some people to believe the

The rejection of. Oswald's offer to defect makes absolutely
no sense to me.
Mr. Sawyer has’ just pursued that momentarily. I think. that

~The exposition, taking you off to worry about the. exposi-

No reprisals against your family:. Nobody was working {

to eight large files, you only read the first portion of one

‘file. You said no KGB ever ‘talked to Oswald regarding

letting him defect. The reason you gave us for that was that h
slashed his wrists and you concluded he was unstable. Yet prior
to that discovery of his instability, you granted him a visa
in two days.and he asked to be permitted to defect prior to
slashing his wrists, and therefore you had to make the decision
prior. to slashing his writs, prior to knowing that he slashed
his wrist, that you were going to reject him. That doesn't
hold. water either.

Finally, you said in your testimony american defection was
very rare. ‘All the more reason, if it only happens once every .
year or a couple of times a year, or three times between "56
and '59, it is totally incredible to me that ‘he would not have

been interrogated. No reasonable person can believe that story};

You said he was not interesting, you were not interested

24 in him, the KGB rejected him. .Despite that, you were "recruiting

3 right and left all ‘kinds of people .to assist in the espionage

a major piece of evidence, and was so considered by the Warren

nation of Lee Harvey Oswald, and I think the key part of your
testimony that we are concerned with, not so much the question
about ‘any inconsistencies in it, but are you right on the big
question, namely, was ee Warvey Oswald a KGB agent?

I want to mention, I have been a little surprised by your
jtestimony, bythe gaps in your knowledge of Oswald, and really

how little you knew about him. For example, when he went to

Minsk, he was tranferred out of your oversight, I take it, and
as I understood you, you did not know he was married until
i

later on, and did not know he had gone back to the United

iStates.

that. The question I wonder, that that brings to my mind is,

Lf Oswald-had been a KGB agent, are you certain you would have

iknown it? In other words, if you didn't even know he was

couldn't he have been a KGB agent in that period without your

that I would appear here, that the staff of your.-~ your

Mr. Preyer. I just wondered if you had read about the
Mexican cable, and perhaps through the. years may have been --

Mr. Nosenko. No, I never have seen that it was mentioned

Mexican cable. I have seen that he visited Mexico, in Mexico

visited Soviet and Cuban embassies. This I have seen in books,

‘this fact.

Mr. Preyer. If I-have got one more moment, Mr. Chairman,
to change the subject, one of the things that struck me is
that when you defected, as Mrs. Burke mentioned, in Geneva,
in 1964, very shortly after the Kennedy Assassination, I get
the impression that the CIA or American forces to whom you
defected, did not have much to say about the assassination or
was not -=

: When she was there, did she interview Oswald?

19°! first of all, can American tourists go to Minsk easily?

You knew that Lee Harvey Oswald was a Marine?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes.

Mr. Dodd. You knew by. your answer to Mrs. Burke's questio
a minute ago that Oswald had a student's knowledge of Russian?

Mr. Nosenko. When he was living. in Minsk, not before,

before he has come. No.

Mr. Dodd. You didn't know that?

that he was passing through all cases, all questions, with me
for the period almost two years.
Mr. Edgar. Who other than Bruce Solie did you talk to about
correcting your earlier statements?
Mr. Nosenko. I wasn't correcting them. They were correcting}
they were talking returning back to every case.
Mr. Edgar. One final question.

Mr. Nosenko. And also besides Mr. Solie, were people coming

Mr. Edgar. One final question. You stopped our hearing
about an hour ago and were concerned about’ our playing the tape
and bringing up old memories, and I respect the fact that you are
very patriotic in coming before this Committee and helping us.

Would you be willing to sit down with our staff and go
through a series of written questions which outline specifically
for you the contradictions of your 1964, '65, '66 and early "67
timeframe, with the statements that you made, in '67, '68 and
'78, and indicate in a yes-no manner which statement, laid side
by side, is true and which statement is false?

Mr. Nosenko. If it is the wish of the Committee, sure.

Mr. Edgar. ‘Thank you, Mr. Chairman. .

The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired.

March, the first week in March. Is that about right?.

Mr. Nosenko. Sir, I. do not remember dates, but --
Mr. Fithian. It was between February and April?
Mr. Nosenko. Right, right.

Mr. Fithian. The information we have is that it was early

Now Have:you talked to the FBI about that testimony at any
time since then?

Mr. Nosenko. Gentlemen, on many, many times I have seen
FBI, many, many questions raised. I cannot -- about this testi-
mony, no, no.

Mr. Fithian. About the Oswald testimony?

Mr. Nosenko. : About Oswald were asked questions, but not about
this testimony . I do not remember about this testimony.

Mr. Fithian. My question is, there is a written transcript
summary of your testimony to the FBI taken on March 5th, 1964.

Mr. Nosenko. Right.

Mr. Fithian.. My question is, have you at any time since
then visisted with the FBI about this testimony?

Mr. Nosenko.. No, sir, no, sir.

Mr. Fithian. Now, next, when -- what is your understanding
as to when Oswald first offered to defect, when you first knew,
when the KGB first knew he was interested in defecting?

Mr. Nosenko: I cannot give you a date.

Mr. Fithian. All right.

Well, he filled out an application --

Mr. Nosenko. No, no, no application, in oral form. He
told the interpreter in oral form.

Mr. Fithian. This was the Intourist?

Mr. :‘Nosenko. Interpreter of the Intourist.

Mr. Fithian. And then the Intourist came to the KGB?

Mr. Nosenko. Right, and it immediately was informed to KGB
that this American applies, wants to stay, said to interpreter.

Mr. Fithian. And then you reviewed the file?

Mr. Nosenko. It was several pieces of pages what we had on
him. It wasn't even file.

Mr. Fithian. But you reviewed whatever applications --

Mr. Nosenko. Right. No it wasn't application to stay. He in
oral form told the interpreter that he wants to stay Soviet
Union.

Mr. Fithian. You reviewed the pages that he had filled out
for the visa and any other sheets that you had?

Mr. Nosenko. He didn't -- yes, these documents, yes, for
the visa, questionnaire and --

Mr. Fithian. Yes. What I am trying to get at is what did
you have in front of you physically, knowledgeably about Oswald?

Mr. NOsenko. What I remember, it was it was several pages
only, was questionnaire, was form of document from Intourist
received how long his tour and how many days. There was checks °

of Oswald in archives of KGB to forms. There was information from

Mr. Fithian. All right. Let me just stop you here.

Mr. Nosenko. Yes.

Mr. Fithian. The forms in there by the KGB were filled out
based on what information?

Mr. Nosenko. On his name, what he supplied; who he is, when
he was asking visa.

Mr. Fithian. But they conducted no check, no search?

Mr. Nosenko. It is in the archives of KGB, if he ever was
in Soviet Union, on him there will be something. If he wasn't in
Soviet Union but he was known to intelligence service --

Mr. Fithian. But you didn't have any record on that.

Mr. Nosenko. Nothing.

Mr. Fithian. And so the final question is that the only
thing that you had to judge -that he was an uninteresting subject
was what he had told the Intourist guide?

Mr. Nosenko. Right.

Mr. Fithian. That is the only substantive thing?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, sir, and his questionnaire for who he
is, his name, whatever he filled about himself. That's all.

The Chairman. The time of the gentleman has expired.

The Chair has one additional request from one member, for
one additional question.

Mr. Sawyer?

Mr. Sawyer. I just have one additional question, and that is

the $80,000 you got for compensation and~ the $15,000 or $20,000

you got later, that was net money after whatever taxes or whatever
it was” --

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, after all taxes were taken.

Mr. Sawyer. Thank you.

Mr. Dodd. Mr. Chairman?

The Chairman. Mr. Dodd?

Mr. Dodd. I just wondered for the record, I wondered if,
Mr. Nosenko, you could tell us when you arrived in this country on
February 12th, 1964, between February 12th, 1964 and April 4th,
1964, where were you in this country?

Mr. Nosenko. February 12 of 1964 and April ath, I was rtaving
in house in Virginia. I do not know address.

Mr. Dodd. Did you go -- did you travel at all?

Mr. Nosenko. No, sir.

Mr. Doda. No vacation? . oot,

Mr. Nosenko. Oh, I went’in March on week to Hawaii.I was.

Mr. Dodd. Were you on your own?

Mr. Nosenko. No, no, no, with guards.

Mr. Dodd. It was a relaxed period for you and just a chance
to rest?

Mr. Nosenko. Chance to get a little bit rest.

Mr. Dodd. Is it your knowledge that this is the normal way
that defectors are treated when they come to this country?

Mr. Nosenko. I do not know.

Mr. Dodd. Just one last point, Mr. Chairman, and that is

with regard to the American exhibit, as a result of a statement by
Mr. Klein which I understand you did not disagree with, the American
exhibit ended on Sepgember 4th, 1959? That's when the termination
of the exhibit was?

Mr. Nosenko. Yes, he showed'me an article.

Mr. Dodd. Is it your knowledge that employees thatworked
during the exhibit stayed on for a period of time after that?

Mr. Nosenko. Sure, to it will be disassembled, this is the
whole process is going on. It is closed for visitors to visit,
to look.

Mr. Dodd. How long a period would that have been, a week?

Mr. Nosenko. No, more.

Mr.::Dodd. More?

Mr. Nosenko. More, sure.

® Dodd: . Thank you, Mr.Chairman.

The Chairman. Mr. Nosenko, with reference to your earlier
comments this evening regarding what: transpired during your
period of isolation, which you described as extreme spartan
conditions, I would like to make this request of you. I think the
record ought to in a very graphic way portray those conditions
under which you were subjected during that period of time, and
while you are complying with Mr. Edgar's request and working with
the staff in terms of the contradictory data, would you also agree
to work with the staff in terms of seeing that the record has a

complete and accurate description --

able employee who was involved in that process in the State.
