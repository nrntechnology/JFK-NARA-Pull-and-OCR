i, George PARIS (Spelling as picked up originally by Office of
Security in written report of Polygragk examination repert, and
therefore likely phonetic.) - Greek businessman in Tokyo.

3. Is the course of further debriefing in connection with his Polygraph
Test, HAHN ciz!med that George ERIS or PARIS was the individual who had
introduced HAHN to a club in Tokyo located off the Ginza, the name of which

- club tranalated into English is “Tomorrow is Too Late". At this club HAHN
- met a Japancse hostess by the name ef Noriko AWAJI, whose real name was

tater established to be Noriko MATS(ZAKAYA, whom he subsequeniiy dated.
There is no further information currently available on this hostess, In the
interim, HAHN has obtained a divorce from his wife, who had been a witting
participant in his agent activities for the Soviets, and is known currently to be
living {a a common-law relationship with a Japanese yirl who may be identical
with Noriko MATSUZAKAYA. As indicated above, HAHN and his current
mistrese are currently in Sapporo, Hokkaido.

4. The ex-wife of Valentin HAHM, whose full name {ie rot known to the
writer, and the two HAHN sons, are currently being sponsored for resettle-

there. Date of HAHN's introduction to the Club and to Noriko MATSUZAKAYA
by George PARIS aka George PERIS was ectimated by fr. Sayle to have been
somewhere between 1954 and 1957. With regard to Valentin HAHN's own
inclinations toward sharing his knowledge of romance with others, Mr. Sayle
advised that Security “ffice had established that while employed as a contract
agent of the [Tokyo Station] HAHN had pimped for CIA Staff personnel in Tokyo.

6, As attachment herewith, the writer appends additional background
data on the professional intelligence activities and contacts of Valentin HAHN
and family as noted during the oral briefing oy Sayle.

7. Om basie of the above, it can be safely assumed that the George
PARIS known to HAHN ts identical with George PERISTERGPOULOS aka
George PERIS, weil-known Tokyo businessman and Honorary Deputy Consal
of the Royal Greek Consulate in Yokohama, Japan, as reported in SCTGKY-63
and SCTOKY-64. It is noteworthy that PERIS’ contacts throughout his career.
commencing ¥ “tn ms original reported employment in Tientsin, China, through
bie activities and contacts in Shanghai, Caina, and later in Tokyo, not exciud-
‘ing his marriage to Aurelia CZZRWINSKA, have been exclusively with
individuals of Russian or Eastern Zuropean background, many of them of
Ruselan Jewish background, who are eitber highly suspect or have been iden-
tiffed as long-time agents of Soviet Intelligence. PERIS’ reported route of
arrival in Tokyo via Harbin, Tientsin and Shanghai, as well as his employ-
ment by Sondovich Brothsrs and.contacts with individuals who tie in with th -
Boris SOLOMONIK complex and Borsol Fur Trading Corporation, smacke
very strongly of the old Cominterr Apparat of the 20's and 30's. Also it
parallets ihe travel patterns of a number of individuals involved in the SOBLE
saee, principally the SCBLES themselves who were exfiitrated irom the
Soviet Union via Toxyo, Japan, to the U.S.A. and who, most notably of all,
also were under cover of operating a Bristie Business as is Sondovics Brothers,

8. According to earlier reporting in the ZRGRACE investigation,

_ George PERIS is alleged to have been a contact of William Hamilton MARTIN

in Tokyo, and to have offered MARTIN some type of jod or business partner-
ship deal in connection with the rug business.

9. Mr. Carrico informally indicated that he personally suspects that
MARTIN'‘s Introductisn to the fine art of masochistic torture by an unideoti-
fied Japanese fomaie, as reported by Mro. Ardelie GASDA to FAI agents,
may have been effected at or through his patronage of the ‘Tomorrow is Too
Late” Club to which he may well have been taken or introduced by bis friend
PERIS, Thies possibility, however, is subject to farts investigation.

10. As initial fotlow-up to[SCTOKY}-63 and[SCTOKY}e4, outgoing cable
of 7 Sept. 60 requesting further check-out of the Club, etc. was prepared.

A second cable to be sent by Privacy Lank to Seoul, Korea, has also been
érafted, and requests check of PERIS' arrival, activities and contacts,
departure from Korea subsequent to 28 January 1960, This cable has been
presented separately for your approval and may likely be sudject to revision,
wierefore no copy is attached. It ie further suggested that Cifice of Security
be authorized to pass to NSA Security Officiale working on this case the
information on PERIS relayed in above [SC KYkables, such information to
be properly sterilized of course, and that NSA in turn be requested to check
and obtain from U.S. Navy Personnel Records ful copies in duplicate of the
orginal reports on the specific duty stations or assignments, including dates
of service at each, to which MARTIN and MITCHELL were cetailied, also
detailed leave recorde, travel records, and other pertinent background data
contained in such files, to cover the entire period of their respective service
with the U.S. Navy. It is also suggested that NSA officials be requested to
obtain similar detailed original reports in duplicate from the Denartment of.
ahs Army te eves cue porsoa Of MAK SIN's Civilian employment in Japan,
with speciat emphasis on any reports of MARTIN's extra-curricular activities,
contacts, club memberships, identified personal contacts with persons sot
employed in his own office, leave travel, etc., which may be reflected in
official records. One copy of all such reports are requested for thie Agency,
to permit further checking of known or newly identified contacts he may have
had in Japan.
