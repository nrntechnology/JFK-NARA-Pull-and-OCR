EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHET'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A

CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE 9 #;
USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUMPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING =”
POLITICAL PRISONCRS, THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF
ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF
POLITICAL PRISONERS. A REPORT FROM A SENSITIVE SOURCE INDICATES THAT
THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COUBLD
DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. ¥
2- THE EXCHANGE OFFER-HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO
NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTION,
PROBABLY SECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF 80TH

FROBLEMS AND PROSPFCTS FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS (7A
MEDIA IN ALLENDE'S CHILE : ,

HIGHLIGHTS

Since President Allende's electoral victory in 1970, the Government
propayanda appatatus has rgunted a coordinated Campaign apainat
the opposition communications media focusing on the prestipious

El Mercurio newspaper chain and key’ opporition radios, The long-.

- Fange goal is to create conditions that will insure Government

control over the media so that an emasculated opposition will operate
intuitively and through self-censorship within an approved framework

The opposition radio stations bear the brunt of an array of legal
and. illegal devices designed to intimidate them, These devices
include the threat of violence, favoritism in the distribution of

essential Government advertiging revenue, ternporary closures,
and Govérnment-fomented etrikes, :
Chile's national television -- the only country-wide channel «= has
become an important Propaganda instrument for the Governrnent,

’ But it is being challenged. by a Catholic University channel which is

attempting to expand its service beyond the Santiago area. . .

A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition,
lasting more than a. year, hae taken place at the Papelera, Chile's’
only important private newsprint producer, with the company
Supported by the opposition media Stymying repeated Government
efforts to take over the firm, The paper company claims that
Government Price policies have brought it close to bankruptcy,

Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the Opposition media

have continued to function, taking advantage of the fluid political —
situation currently Prevailing in Chile, and have become increasingly
effective in exploiting the Government's #conomic failures and the
growing dissension within the ruling Marxist coalition,

Nevertheless, the Opposition’s economic base that sustains its media ~
is being slowly undermined as the Coverninent expands its control
over the Chilean economy, Many opposition media ore reportedly
atready in difficult financial straits, The Chilean Communist Party,
seeking to strengthen its voice in the March 1973 Congressional
elections, has already purchased five beleaguered radio stations

{one a former Opposition station) in southern Chile. . >

“THE ALLENDE PROCESS - HOW THE MEDIA ARE TREATED

“Allende's treatment of the Opposition media and hia utilization of ©
the Pro-Government media offer reveating insights into the unique
claim that Chile will Carry out a Socialist revolution within the frarae-~

/ Work of traditional bourgeois and democratic institutions without
Social cost, °

Any Chilean government posseseres wide powers that can be ernployed

- “to control and intimidate media Oppsnerts piven sufficient will power and

“tyniciom to do’ so, despite the fact that media frecdoms in Chile are
twice- guaranteed, both in the 1925 ‘constitution and ina statute of

to the Government coalition or independent supporters of UP poli
in newspapers, radios, magazines, and in journalistic bodies, The
CUP's -have been most active at the union level: demandi g exorbitant
wage increases, insisting that UP employees Le given the right to
express their opinion on editorial pages, disrupting legitimate union
meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company data to
the leftist press and to the Government, :

The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding frecdom of
the press was most explicitly and revealingly stated by the organizing
committee for a conference of leftist journalists which was held in
Santiago in April 1971, The committee issued the following statement
prior to the conference: : :

...we believe that we must fight for true freedom of
the preas, which will only be posible when there is

_ true economic independence. We maintain that Chile
will have true freedom of the presa only when the means

_ of mags comnmmmnication are part of the area of social
property,, that is, (when they) belong to all Chileans, .
The press, radio, television, and the theater must be
tools at the service of liberation and culture ‘of our
people and not a private business, an ideological
battering ram of the national and forcign minority
(the capitalists) as is presently the case, 7 (anders
lining added) +]

Another statement said "the mission of journalists is to support and
defend the People’s Government (the UP) together with ali the workers,"
The declaration also underlined the support of UP newsmen for
“Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism,"

and threw a bouquet at Cuba's Prensa Latina agency for its “objective”
reporting of the Chilean phenomenon, Allende himself lent legitimacy

to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the conference

when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act as the "vanguard!
of the revolution by “elevating the political level of the peaple. "
Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende
asserted that his Government would respect freedom of information
while at the same time he lamented his Government's “excessive
tolerance" for the opposition media.

Partial blame for leftist infiltration of Chilean stations must rest
with "bourgeois" radio owners, Long before Allende became president
the Chilean businessmen and politicians who owned radio Stations
made it a practice to hire leftist commentators because they believed
that leftists were superior professionals aed helped to increase
listenership, When the UP came to power it tapped an existing source

of manpower.

In addition, the Government frequently utilized existing regulations
to gain its ends, Radio concessions are granted by a Government
entity (Servicios Electricos) attached tothe Interior Nijnistry. The
same entity can cancel or transfer such concessions, Regulations
promulgated during World War II state that "In case of internal
disturbance, catastrophe or war radio stations are subject to the
rules, control, and censorship that the Government may adopt,"

The principal Government weapon, however, is ite control
over public service advertising, which traditionally has provided —
the bulk of revenues for Chilean radio stations, The Government
hae dangled the prospect of advertisernents in return for favorable

‘news treatment, but the bait has not been picked up by the major
opposition radios which recognize that their independence is at
stake, The economic squeeze makes the future cf Chilean
independent radios appear bleak.

C. Television

Since its inception in Chile in 1962, television has race great
aridm, but the medium etill lags behind radio, especially. in the
provinces where technical conditions for viewing are poor, Accord-
ing to the best cotimates 2vailablé, there are 350, 000 sete in
Santiago and a total of 500, 000 sets in the country, Chile is served
by the following television channels; 1) A national network with
some 21 oatlets throughout the country; 2) the Catholic, University ~
channel in Santiago; 3) a separate Catholic University channel in
Valparafeo; and 4) the University of Chilg channel in Santiago,

The Government clearly recognizes television's importance as
a propaganda vehicle, and under the direction of an Allende :
confidante, newsman Augusto Olivares (Socialist and a suspected
member of the ultra-lefe MIR -- Movement of the Revolutionary
Left), it has transformed Chile's only nationwide television channel
into an outright political instrument of the Government coatition,
Slanted commentaries favoring UP policies, character assassinations
intended to smear political and class opponents, and a steady drum |
fire of Socialist propaganda in news and cultural programming

became standard fare, . . .

Chile Films also initiated agreements with the experimental film
institute (leftist) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the

“develop the new Chilean film industry."

Its products are intended to glorify the roles of workers, peasants,
and students in the march to Chilean-style Socialism, romanticize the
proletarian role of the Chilean Communist and Socialist Parties, and
attack the "bourgeoisie" asd their “imperialist” allies. Despite an
intense publicity buildup, hawever, few films actually appeared in
the 1970-72 period. Most.of the films that were produced appeared to
be pieced together from newsreel film taken during the Allende .

sign to carry out a peaceful transition to “socialism
with democracy, pluralism and liberty.” The parties -
In his Coalition -were in a distinct minority in the
Congress, and although there was no doubt about the
Jegitimacy of his élection by that body, his victory
had only been possible because of the conditional
-| support of the Christian Democrats. The PDC, it
should be noted, included both Radomiro Toric,
the party's:.1970 presidential candidate,’ who had
gone to Allende’s. house to: conpratulate him the
day after the popular election, clearly inferring his
future support, and conservatives like Senator Juan
“de. Dios Carmona, who had fought within the party
to prevent It from voting for Allende’ in the run-off.
In the Immediate aftermath of the election the POC”
was controlled by the Tomic forces, who claimed
to be In-favor of "communitarlan” socialism, nation-
alization. of copper, acceieration of agrarian reform,
and reduction of Chile's dependencia on the United
States, One way, then, for Allende to achieve his |
acknowledged goal of majority support for the’
transition to socialism would have been to try to
arrive at an understanding with the Christian Oemo-
crats on the points in his program with which ‘they
were In agreement. This might have provoked the.
secession of some of the rightist members of the
POC, but If an accord had been reached with the
party's leaders, it would likely have given Allende
a majority in the Congress for at least part of his
program.

Flushed with victory and unwilling to come to
terms with the party which he had termed “the new
face of reaction” during the campaign, Allende chose
an alternative strategy. The next congressional elec-
tions were not. scheduled to take place until March
1973, but the Chilean Constitution provided that in
| the event of a conflict. with the Congress over the
text of a constitutional amendment, the President.
could call a national plebiscite. The strategic course.
adopted by Allende was to attempt to expand popu-
lar support for his coalition and then propose a
constitutional amendment which, in accordance with
the Popular Unity electoral program, would replace
the existing bicameral legislature with a unicameral

certain to reject the amendment, but if Allende
had the support of a majority In the country, he
could win the plebiscite and secure control of the

Allende's strategy for the expansion of electoral
support was an economic one which drew as much
from John Maynard Keynes as It did from Karl Mars,
The Chilean economy, already operating below
Capacity, had gone into a profound recession a3 a

Vuskovic, Allende's Minister of Economics, was to

come by skewing the annual wage readjustment for
‘the preceding year's inflation (35 percent in 1970)
in favor of the low-income sector of the population
(the lowest income groups received a 40-percent in-
crease). The utilization of unused industrial ca-
pacity, combined with strict enforcement of price
Controls, more stringent collection of taxes, and re-
fusal to devalue the Chilean escudo ‘in relation to
the dollar, were expected to contain possible infla-
tionary pressures which might result. (The Allende
government also had a cushion of nearly’ $400
million in foreign reserves teft to it by the Frei
government as a result of high international prices
for copper, Chile’s principal export.)

The strategy also contained. a Marxist elament—

the pattern was one-of polarization of Chilean politics

and’ 4ociety into two opposing blocks. Thé Allende’

forces controlled the executive and pursued an in-
creasingly vigorous ideological purge of those who
were not entirely sympathetic to the government.
The opposition controled the legislature, and in
October 1971 .the Christian Democrats and the
rightist parties attempted to assert legislative con-
trol over the.expansion of the. public sector by voting
‘Im favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the
use of the intervention and requisition procedures

Congress. This legislative act, zeferred to as an

amendment on the “Three“Areas of Property,” be- |

came the focus of a continuing deadlock between
the President and Congress that’ lasted - until
Allende’s overthrow in September 1973. ,
Altende's refusal to accept the amendment or to
call a plebiscite to resolve his differences with the
Congress appeared to the congressional opposition
to be a decisive indication of his determination to
bypass the legislature in carrying out the Popular
Unity program, and from the time of the adoption of

the amendment onward, the Christian Democrats:

began to cooperate with the rightist parties in- op-
posing the executive. One method was to impeach
ministers for violation or (more often) nonenforce-
ment of the taw. The first of many such impeach-
ments took place in January 1972. Another method
was to present a united electoral front against the
government. Informal cooperation between the
rightist parties and the Christian Democrats led to
striking victories in two by-elections in January 1972,

cratic Confederation (Contederacion Democratica—

carried on fengthy negotiations with the Christian

on this issue, only ta have it rejected by the top
command of the Popular Unity coalition parties. The

and joining the opposition, a move Aliende described
as “a stab In the back." " A secend set of, negotia-
tions if June between the’ head cf the Christian
Democratic Party and Allende’s Minister of Justice
broke dawn when the time limit set by the Christian
Demacrals expired and the POC leadership refused
to extend it.

prevented what could have been a convergence of

was joined by two other generals who, with Prats,
had led the mititary forces that had queticd the
tank-regiment revolt in June. -

On August 9 Allende swore In what. he called a
“national security cabinet,” with General Prats as

of the revolt and demanded the lifting of the con-

' To justify their action, the military. commanders
broadcast a communiqué to the nation. While ad-
mitting that the Allende government had initially
come to power by legal means, they announced that
it had “falten into flagrant illegitimacy” by violsting
fundamental rights, by “artificially fomenting the

‘class struggle," by refusing to implement the de

cisions of the Congress, the judiciary and the
Controller-General, by causing a critical decline in
agricultural, commercial and ‘industrial. activity In
the country, and by bringing about a state of In-
tlation and anarchy which “threaten the internal and

concluded: : .

~ Allende in’ Retrospect

Ce

Snecite aspects of the Chilean system also made
tha Allende experiment a particularly difficult one.
He was able to come to power in the first place
because of Chile's deeply-rooted commitment to the
democratic. system and because the Marxist parties
were able to mobilize'a part of the proletariat and
the peasantry, and he had at his disposal many
instruments tor state control of the economy which
had been developed by previous administrations
since the -1930's. However, he was required to
operate within an institutional system which included
frequent’ and staggered elections, proportional rep:
resentation, and a multiparty system which made
Majority rule very difficult-and often gave veto pow:
ers to the-extremes of Ripht.and Left. The economy
had been characterized for nearly a century by 3
chronic tendency to inflation, and successive govern-
ments had consistently ignored agriculture in the
Interest of securing urban electoral support. The

most important systemic constraint of alt, of course,

was the existence of a professionalized and insti-
tutionally-loyal military which was unresponsive to
the Ideological blandishments of the Lelt.”*

- The immediate causes of the military intervention
are apparent from the preceding account. In the last
part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean

politics by both sides and became as polarized as:

the rest of Chilean society—with the overwhelming
majority joining the opposition to Allende. The con-
flict. over education in March-April 1973 heignt-
ened that polarization Just at the time the military
were‘atiempting to extricate themselves from politi-
cal Involvement. Then’ the expansion of arms
searches in mid-1973 revealed the extent to which
Chile was becoming an armed camp on the verge

: of civil war. Finally, the efforts to subvert the existing

military hierarchy by 2 combination of teftist activ-
ity among enlisted men and presidential. maneuver-
ing with promotions and retirements provided the
classis scenario for a coup d'état:

One can also relate Allenae’s duthculties to the
inherent contradictions in the Maraist theory to which
2 appeated.. At the same time that he proclaimed
lis faith in a democratic, pluratist. and libertarian
transition to socialism, many ot his Marxist.sup-
porters spoke and acted on the basis of a belief In
he inevitability of armed confrontation, With his
knewledge, they armed themselves and—-what was
worse—talked incessantly about revolution, The re-
peated Statements ct Régis Debray and others that
the observance of the rules of “bourgeois” legality
was only a tactic until the balance of forces had
improved was hardly likely to persuade doubters of
the sincerity of Allende’s commitinent to democracy. |
When the importation and distribution of arms was
combined with efforts to reorganize education along
ideological lines, to sUbvert military discipline, and
to rearrange the hierarchy of command, It Is not
altogether surprising that the military finally took
action. .

A positive-evaluation of the. Alleride years would
certainly credit him with a sincere effort to ralse
tog living standards ot low-income groups and to
involve them actively In the determination of thelr
own future. It would likewise stress the continucd
existence of freedom of expressicn for alt points of
view in Chile right up to the coup, A more negative
assessment would ask whether the low-income
groups in Chile genuinely benefited from an eco-
nomic policy. which after the first halt of 1972 pro-
duced hyperinflation, a continuous drop in agrl-
¢ultural and industrial production, and a reduction
in the real value of wages and salaries. Even more

January 197h

, Stl so keenly reenembered and the generals who
, Made it are ming unplcusuntly high, the fact
remains that Sclvador Allende died a lucky
‘man In Life he wes a failure. Both his policies
aod bis country were shattercd long before the
end. But in death he achieved success beyond his
dreams. InstanUy canonised as the Western
world’s “newest left-wing martyr, he became
: overvight the most potent political cult-figuro
" since Lis old fricad, Che Guevara.
To some extent, of courte, the congregation
bad alresdy. been prepared fot
elevation. In the three years of All

stration the “Chilean experiment’ and the .

“Chilean road to socialism had become fave
ourite topics of discussion among Iefi-wing
groups in Europe, where Chile's supposed
resemUiane to Italy or France bad encouraged

the belief that Burope might, for once, foliow in”

Latin America’s footsteps instead of the: ‘other
way about. Many espiring revolutionaries from
Europe and the Uniied States had actually
joined their Latin American counterparts in
Caik in eruch the same spirit as the'r. dropped-
out contemporaries had hitch-hiked to Nepal

. boping for a glimpse of Paradise in action. By
the-time of the September coup the military junta
claimed there were as many as 15,000 foreigners
of all kinds tn Chile, actively supporting—some-
times with violence—the “socialist revolution.”

These specially interested groups’ or” iadivie |

¢usks obviously provided a ready ostwork for

Allende’s death. But the shocked und, at times,

beyood such committed parties to embrace
many of the West's ordinary liberals and social
democrats, For them, os much as for the self-

shared by so many others around the world—

Hence the composite picture, now accepted
throughout a wide spectrum of Westerns liberal
and Jeft-wing opinion, of Allende os a yeauine
social democrat of impeccable constitutiunal
propriety who met his end at the hands of a
fascist conspiracy on behaif of a minority “ruling
class” aided and abcited by the Unita States
of Americ.

To replace this romantic vision a with something

for myths undoubtedly possess a life of Gsir own

bard to know where to tesin to tort them out,
One idea, however, seeres basic to them all;
that Allende and his Popular Unity coalition

odd belief should have gained any currency

mark of the confusion that surrounds the

such as those referring to the “defeat of the
democtatic will", some of Allcnde's sympathisers
abroad seem even to believe that he oot merely
enjoyed a massive popular majority of te vote
but wes also the first President of his country to
do £0.

and had been for many years a functiosing

power in Congress. Both is theory and ia practice,

athe forces he was dealing with, either for or :
against him. He raised expectations on his owa

them, and he encouraged opposiiioa on the
otber side by his use‘of a revolutionary rhetoric

{whose threats ho also could noc fulii. :

: At best he was muddle-headed; and time may
show that he was deliberately deceitful. Certainly |
he managed to deceive a lot of people, including .
himself, But in the end reality taught its own, hard *
lessons. That you can’t bea dgnocrat and a
revolutionary—at least, not in a socic.y that is
already admittedly democratic. That you can’t
be anti-American and expect the Americans to
help you. That you can't pose ns the people's

_ leader end kick most people in the teeth, That
you can’t conscript soldicrs into potitics and
expect them to remain apolitical. That you can’t
have inflation roaring out of sight end maiatain a
base for social welfare. That, in shozt, the real |
world is not Cloud-cuckoo-land, Down bere,
you just can’t have your cake aneat it

It is sad that such elementary lessons should
have to be taught yet again at such tragic cost in

* Chile. But it is alarzring that s9 many peoplo
elsewhere should evidently fail to grasp that they
are the lessons, { .

NETHERLANDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLANDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Editorial by N. van WBegyenhuysens Reformatorisch Dagblad,

Dutch, 19 April 1974, p

.The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be
having adjustment problems. These rather prolonged symptoms:
seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they
still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of
their Marxist president. is definitely over and that their
country is now being ruled by a small group of reactionaries
who are trying to keep the people under control through
terrorism, repression,’ and torture. Such problems will take
you quite a ways in the Netherlands and those idealists were
quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

what is the situation? Most of the approximately
259 refugees with a high school or university education do
not.work. About half of them have been housed at the “Huis
ter Schie” in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on
the terrace or play volleyball in the yard. 3oard and
lodging are free and at the end of the week they pick up
another 25 guilders pocket money. In addition they receive
free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and
compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the idea that they are better off than’
many. old people in the Netherlands? “You are probably right,
because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare;
they are being paid from the frozen funds which had been
allocated for development aid to their fatherland, Chile.
So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.
14-00000

Considering that this small proup.of pampered exiles
is preaching revolution even here and with a full stomach,
it may be. useful to point out a few facts. These are facts
which are well known in the Ministry in The Hague: but for
some reason never made it to the Netherlands press.

Facts
The great majority of the refugees are not even cele

Chilean nationals. They are natives of Bolivia, Brazil, and .

Uruguay. They came to Chile as a regult of illeral and

revolutionary. activities in which they had been involved in

these South and Middle American countries, the ultimate

consequences of which they did not wish to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende
showed sympathy for their situation. His first action as
president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to
declare amnesty for all those who “were members of terrorist
underground organizations," those who during the last months
of. his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank
robbery, the armed robbery of self-service stores, the theft
of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and | attempted

murder. :
The fact that some of those revolutionaries received

Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende's policy of
granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries,

' These refugees with a high school or higher level education

seemed to have no adjustment problems in Chile. As a result
they soon found their way to important key positions in the
government.

‘The fugitives didn't ‘suffer any sleepless nights in
Chile either, because they felt protected by a militant
Varxist army, armed to the teeth. Some 10,000 revolutionaries,
from all points of the compass, were at ‘their disposal.

Definition an

In the Berner Tageblatt, a Swiss newspaper which
is known for not exsuneratices Dr. Mario Puelma, from the
University of Freiburg, wrote the following: "The concept
of political refugee . is only of limited value when applied.

to Chile. whatever ona’s attitude toward the military junta
14-00000

may be, one thing is certains the Chilean refugees were not

pursued only because of thelr ideology, thoir status, or ; i
thelr origin. This is the traditional, humanitarian defini- - i
tion for a refupee. For the most part they are people who, :

‘in their own country, could be legally charged with crimes

which are punishable under any judicial system.

These refugees carried out activities in Chilo which i
were against the constitution. As a matter of fact, they are uo
specialists in violence. This is why they sought asylum in :
the foreign embassies in Santiago and why there are 30 many

forelgners among them."
