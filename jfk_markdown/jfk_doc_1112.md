MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, DDR&E
Office of the Secretary of Defense

SUBJECT: Anti-Sabotage Operations in Latin America

The Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban
Affairs (ICCOCA} has recently considered a CIA proposal to provide
guidance to US firme in Latin America confrented with Castro-
communist inspired sabotage of their facilities and assets. CLA has
contracted for the preparation of a report which will consolidate the
experiences of several US firme in Latin America in combatting
@abotage. After consideration by the ICCOCA this report will be
furnished through our country teams in Latin America to local US
firms to assist them in instituting appropriate anti-sabotage programs.

I would be most grateful if you would prepare a brief report
designed to supplement the CIA project which would include enumera-
“tion of general guidelines which might be adopted by US firme in the
Latin American area in eombaiting sabotage. In particular, an
enumeration of known appropriate anti-sabotage devices available. on
the commercial market tegether with the manufacturer's names would
be most helpiul..

A member of my staff has discussed this project with Mr.
Pheips of your staff, who has indicated that DDR&E might be of assist-
ance in this matter based on.a recent field trip to Venezuela where
problems peculiar to that area were studied at the request of the US
Ambassador. It is also possible that commercial devices developed
for South Vietnam would have applicability in Latin America, Because
this project is designed for distribution to several Latin American

“countries, it is requested that where possible guidelines be developed
which might have genergl application throughout Latin America, but
with emphasic on key subversive target areas, Present plans autici-
pate finalization of thie project by December 23, 1963.

aizeeaft and to keep USCINCSO advised of all information. Sue-
pected craft were not positively identified or intercepted; however,
there were indications that an unidentified surface veasal off the

developed 4 plan uader which the United Sietes could provide asgiate
ance te Venenuelan forces, on three levels of participation, designed
to prevent the surreptitious movement of Castro~Communist arma
and perdonnel into Veneauels. To he fully effective, the plan calls
for US elementa operating from Veneauclan territery which ia not
considered a likely aubject for epprovel by the Government of
Venesguala at the present time,

ec. A joint gurvey and mobile training team of eleven men was
provided by USCINCZO to Venezuela on 22 Novernber 1963, upon
appieval of the concept by the Government of Venezuela, The p purpose
of the team ig te train Veneguelan military personnel in organiaing
and operating 4 Joint operations center; in improving capabilities
im the plotting and ceordiastion of intelligence data, and aerial phote-
graphy; and in coordinating all Venesuclan military and paramilitary
organizations involved in surveillance and intercept operations.

Outlined below is a summary of deliberations of subject sub-.

August was circulated. The report has been circulated to points ‘of ; y

“contact by separate correspondence. . et :

‘Agenda Item 2

: The Subcommittee discussed the SCCS letter which referred to —
_ the recent trip of US students to Cuba. (Attached to enclosure 1) Itwas
.!apparent to all that criticism of the US could be implied from this letter,”
The Chairman stated he would provide. the SCCS with the substance of
State's telegram 647, which outlines actions undertaken by the US —
Government against the students. :

a. CIA, in coordination with the Esso Corporation's Chief of
Industrial Security, will prepare guidance data for distribution to Latin.
America which could be utilized by US commercial firms for the pro-_
tection of their facilities against sabotage. The DOD representative | oo
. Was requested to ascertain whether ARPA had available some commer =
cial protection devices which might be applicable for use in Latin
America against sabotage attacks. The CIA representative stated he

. .- believed ARPA had developed some devices for this purpose, .

. b.. State will prepare a circular telegram to all Latin American
. Ambassadorg requesting that an immediate review of Country Team

Emergency and Evacuation Plans be conducted to insure that plans were
~ adequate to meet a stepped-up campaign of Castro-inspired sabotage.

Y Agenda Item 4 a , sO a

In lieu-of a written report on the Honduran guerrilla problem, on

“. the DOD representative proposéd a firsthand report to the Subcommittee, 9 =
Colonel Walter Hutchins, who has recently returned from assignment as
US Military Attache to Honduras, presented a review of the subversion
situation in that country and then answered questions from the Subcom- :
mittee, The general thrust of Colonel Hutchins! remarks confirmed that
there has been considerable Castro subversive activity in Honduras. The
most serious inroads are achieved through communist radio and press

_ and communist educators. Colonel Hutchins commented that recent

.. Suerrilla activity along the Nicaraguan border was probably limited to

~ groups totaling between 100 and 200 men, He emphasized that Cuban-

’ trained Honduran guerrillas are successfully transiting by air through
_Grand Cayman Island and British Honduras with some transiting Havana :
to Jamaica via Belgrade. In response to a query from a State representa-_
“» tive, Colonel Hutchins pointed out that he believed that both Honduran.

. military and commercial interests were genuinely concerned with Castro
“subversion and that some of their leaders were perfectly capable of
discerning the true nature of the communist threat to Honduras.

: Agenda Item 5

The Chairman stated that the paper for training Latin Americans
‘in the United States (included in the "Krulak Report''*) was too broad in :
scope for implementation by the Subcommittee and proposed that it be | .

rewritten under narrower parameters. inthis regard, the Defense
- representative was

The Chairman stated that preparatory actions on the Isthmian
meeting at San Salvador tentatively scheduled for the second half of

‘November would be held in abeyance pending further developments in

- Control of Travel_to and from Cuba =
: Central Intelli ence Agency

a. Developed highly useful information on frequency
of Cuban "chartered" flights to Brazil, names and nationali-
ties of passengers and crew, and lax measures of control |
followed by Brazilian authorities. Transmitted this informa-.
tion to station chiefs in the Latin American countries of the

non-Brazilians travelling on those flights.

be ‘Maintained close watch over travel to and from
Cuba. See Annex B for table of known travel of Latin ~
‘Americans during July and August. :

c. Asa result. of information furnished to him by
he: ‘CIA Station in Buenos Aires and with the Station's urging,
‘the Argentine Minister of Interior indicated that he would
make. every effort to prevent Argentine delegates from attend
ng the International Union of Architects Congress in Havana

i d. At the urging of the CIA Station and the Embassy,
‘the Bolivian Minister of Interior issued in mid-July an

rder prohibiting the granting of travel permits to Cuba" or.
other bloc countries to Bolivian nationals.

: e. Partly as a result of the efforts of the CIA
‘station in Santiago, the Government of Chile prohibited the-
entry into Chile of organizers of the Cuban-sponsored Second
Latin American Youth Congress, which had been scheduled to
‘take place in Santiago in August. This was one of the —
factors which led to postponement of the Congress.

£. After considerable prodding by the CIA Station.
“and the Embassy the Minister of Public Security of Costa --
Rica presented legislative proposals to the Costa Rican
Assembly which will require all persons intending to travel
‘to Communist countries to have their travel approved by. a:
newly created Costa Rican security agency. —

Be CIA Station ‘in Mexico City. developed information ::
concerning . the clandestine arrival of. passengers in Vera’ Srue

on Cuban merchant ships. Efforts are being made to obtain
more information and to encourage stricter controls by the
Mexican authorities. ‘ F os .

- Department_of State CL,

a. Instructed Embassy Conakry to try to persuade
Guinean authorities to deny use of airport facilities by
‘flights on Habana-Moscow route. These efforts achieved a.
“temporary withholding of permission for future regular flights:
at least until such time as the Soviets develop their own.
refueling facilities at Conakry. ;

b. Instructed Embassy Rio to approach Brazilian
authorities to express. our deep concern at the growing
frequency of Cuban non-scheduled flights to Brazil and request:
their cooperation in curbing them. Also instructed our
Embassies in several Latin American countries to work with cl
station chiefs in furnishing the names of nationals of those
countries travelling on these flights to local authorities’ .
and urging them: (1) to institute tighter controls on their
own citizens travelling to Cuba, and (2) to express their
concern to the Brazilian Government over Cuban use of Brazil
as a way station for transporting subversives.

c. As a result of representations made to the :
British Government about Cuban flights to the Cayman Islands.
carrying Latin American subversives, the British developed

an administrative scheme which will effectively prohibit the
use of British Caribbean dependencies by Cubana as transit

points for passengers. The British intend to require transi
visas of passengers passing through their areas, and to ;
reject applications. for such visas except in certain special
cases. Persons not possessing visas would be prevented from
leaving their aircraft, or r would be returned to their. point

of. » origin. : .
; a. Instructed Embassy Mexico City on August 29 to
‘inform the Mexican airline CMA that the United States is

opposed to'a proposal that CMA operate charter flights.to

carry refugees from Habana to Central America.’ CMA, as.
result, stated that they: had-no. intention of proceeding -
further with this project.

e. Instructed our missions in ‘Curacao: and the Hague
to investigate a report that KLM was planning to renew:
scheduled Curacao-Habana flights and to reiterate US -
opposition to resumption of air service to Cuba. . KUM assured
our Embassy that there is no plan to initiate. service,
scheduled or non-scheduled, to Habana.

£. Instructed Embassy Ottawa to express” “our “strong
objections to a proposal; that a Cubana charter flight pick:
up a second group of U.S. students in Montreal to fly them*
to Cuba. The flight. was not authorized.

g. Instructed Consulate Georgetown to investigate
Cubana approaches to secure flight facilities. Mission
reported on August 1 that the Governor bed no knowledge of |
any talks between the B.G. Ministry of Communications. and.
the Cuban Government regarding landing rights for Cubana.
planes. The Governor indicated his intention to inquire
further and to keep us advised. London reported that neithe
‘the Cuban nor the British Guiana Governments had raised the

issue of landing rights with H.M.G.

h. - Urged the governments of Mexico, Canada, Jamaica
and the Netherlands to refuse to assist the Cuban Government
‘in its efforts to find a short route for return of the 58
‘American students who illegally travelled to Cuba. Also

nformed Pan American Airways that we were opposed to a Cuban
equest for a PAA charter’ flight to fly the students from
abana to New York..

ie ‘Instructed our missions at Port of Spain. and
arbados on ‘several. occasions to approach these governments
‘o-express the. concern of. the U.S. at. indications of. Cuban:
nterest in: the use: ‘Of their aviation. facilities. bee

‘Embassy. ‘Port ‘Of. Spain “discussed with the Foreign ‘Secretary
arious. legal moves available : hat would enable |

GOTT to control movements of aircraft within their territory
citing examples of such controls instituted by Mexico, Canada
and Ireland. He indicated receptiveness to the proposal tha
‘the list of suggestions be made available to the. aviation |
officials concerned. “ .

5. During a previous reporting period Embassy :

antiago urged the government of Chile to refuse visas to:
Cuban delegated to a preparatory meeting for the II Latin
American Youth Congress scheduled for August in the Chilean

apital. Inability of Cuban delegates to obtain Chilean

isas for this meeting is one of the contributing factors to.
the Cuban sponsors announcing during August that the meeting:
‘had been postponed.

k. Sent general instructions to our missions in
countries which participate in the International Union of
“Architects asking them to urge the coopzration of governmental

uthorities in preventing. or discouraging the attendance of
their nationals to the VII UIA Congress in Habena, September:
29 '- October 4, 1963. Followed this up with instructions ‘to
individual posts to try where feasible to dissuade ny
architects from free world countries from serving on the -jury
for the selection of a Bay of Pigs monument. ;

1. Urged Canadian Government to block a plan to.
ommence food parcel shipments to Cuba on a commercial basis
.that would have required the establishment of. scheduled.
eekly charter flights by Canadian planes.

“Control of Movement of Cuban Propaganda
Central Intelligence Agency

Responding to the urging of the CIA Station, police
£ the State of Guanabara seized large quantities of bh
propaganda brought into Brazil by passengers on the” special
Cubana flights. For example, some 50° pounds of. printed -
propaganda was’ taken from the various passengers | who. arrived
on: ‘the 16 August Cuban. a flight. .

ontrol of Clandestine Movement of Guerrillas and Arms

Department of Defense

ae Continued surveillance of the area eurfounding
Cuba during the months of July and August at the same rate
and with the same emphasis as prior to 1 July 1963.

: b. Continued to maintain U.S. “Forces, primarily’ from
within the Atlantic Command, available to assist other -
Caribbean governments in the interception of suspicious craf
in territorial waters, as might be requested. No such :
requests were received from any other government during the
period covered by this report. However, U.S. Forces did keep’

*track of the location of the Soviet merchant freighter
MITCHURINSK, which was suspected of carrying subversives and
arms from Cuba to British Guiana in mid-July. MITCHURINSK.
was under U.S. surveillance: from its departure from Habana
until United Kingdom forces assumed the task of keeping this
ship- under surveillance upon its approach to Georg=town,:,
British Guiana. Subsequeatly, British police search of -
MITCHURINSK in British Guiana waters revealed nothing of a
suspicious nature.

Central Intelligence Agency

At the repeated urging of the CIA Station in Lima,
the Peruvian Government late in August published a new anti
terrorists law providing a penalty of no less than five
years imprisonment for persons who participate in guerrilla -
activities or in the illegal manufacture of. weapons or woe
explosives. 2 . . :

between British Guiana and. Guba

‘tions facilities in Latin America. Operational dates for
‘the multi-channel radio stations to be installed in Managua
Nicaragua and Tegucigalpa, Honduras have been delaved to 15
October 1963 and 15 December 1963, respectively because of:
‘new engineering and contractual requirements. Negotiations

Exchange of Intelligence on Cuban Subversion:
* Central Intelligence Agency - “

. CIA Stations throughout Latin America continued in
a great majority of countries to furnish to the local interna
security organizations with whom they are in liaison informa-
tion concerning travelers to and from Cuba, as well as such
information as came to CIA's attention concerning the movement:
of funds, arms and propaganda material. In. many instances,
the’ furnishing of information to the internal security
“service by the CIA Station was paralleled by the furnishing: 0:
similar information to the Foreign Office by the Ambassador
or his representative. The response to this information has
varied greatly. The Central American countries, in general,.
began to pay greater attention to the information and act on
it. At the other extreme; the Brazilian Government: during
the reporting period showed little inclination to follow up
on the information. as ! : : . .

‘Chartered Cubana airlines flights between Cuba and -
Brazil have become a major means of transporting non-Cuba
Latin Americans to and from Cuba. The five such flight ‘
since late July have carried nearly 4 400 non- Cubans. °

The first of the. recent series -- on 25 July -- :
brought 7i Latin American passengers to Havana for the
26. July celebrations.” The other four flights -- on 15,
22, 28 and 29 August -- transported over 200 Latin
Americans to Brazil from Havana. Some of the aixcraft
involved. returned to Cuba with smaller numbers of passen
gers. Many of the 200 Latin American passengers had |
been delegates to the 26 July ceremonies, but others had
apparently been in Cuba for longer periods and some had
probably received training there. Of the passengers on
these four flights to Brazil, 75 were natives of
Caribbean area countries. Their: ‘circuitous travel throug

The CIA Station in Quito reports ‘that the military
junta, which assumed power in Ecuador on 11 July, can -
be expected to follow the guidance of the Embassy and.
the Station in controlling travel to and from Cuba and
the Soviet bloc. .The-activities of Cuban subversives
in Ecuador, at least for the present, have been greatly
inhibited by the mass arrests of Communists and pro-
Cubans and by the outlawing of the Communist | Party: by.
the e junta.

Honduras

It is reported that ‘the Fonduran: ‘Communist: Party
has issued.orders to its members not to. attempt to.
travel to Cuba at the-present time. This action is
apparently the result of the inéereasing wigilance of -
thé Honduran government and the greater: implementation.

“Movement of Cuban Propaganda
Guatemala

According to an unconfirmed report received in July
a Bureau of Information of the Communist Party of.
Guatemala is being. formed in collaboration with Prensa
Latina and is to be managed clandestinely. It expects
to receive news by shortwave radio from Cuba and print
‘bulletins for distribution by radio stations. . This may
