GIST:

A special meeting was convened to consider the problem
of the prospective visit of Subject's father to the Russian
Embassy to obtain a visa. It was determined that he should

for Subject. “

of the Office of Security met with Mr. Birch O'Neal, CI Staff;
T.K, Chalmers, CI/Projects; [Henry C. Woodward) CCG/DC; oF
Thornton W, Means, OCG/OCB and the Subject to discuss the
problem of a prospective trip to the Russian Embassy by the
Subject's father for a trip to Russia, __... : ++

2. Mr. O'Neal had Mrs. TARASOFF recount the details of
the situation, She said that several months ago her father
ANTHONY ADAMOVIEZ had indicated an interest in attempting
‘to locate his brother and sisters in Russia. He. sent
correspondence to his home town and received a reply from
his sister MARIYA KALNAK, c/o KALINOTSKIY, VZDEN SKIY RAYON,
MINSKAYA, U.S.S.R.. She stated that his brother IVANU
ULYANOVICHU ADOMOVICHU was also living. This correspondence
inspired ADAMOVIEZ with the desire to visit his brother and
ister in Russia wed his retirement. ADOMOVICHU, age 66,
——in good health, recently’retired from his job as a laborer

wtsir with American Steel and Wire Company and is now determined to
=. Br. isit Russia. Subject's mother has no intention of returning
o Russia.

3. Mrs, TARASOFF, on her return from a short vacation
isit to her husband BORIS D. TARASOFF, an Agency employee
of her father's intention to come to Washington to make
inquiry at the Russian Embassy in regard to his visit to
Russia. Subject's father wished Subject to accompany him
but she indicated that as a government employee she did
not want to go there,

Ob 4, Mrs, TARASOFF says that her oldest sister, Mrs.
[Sherry COMELLA* knows of her CIA employment and the necessity
Hot to divulgé this information. Subject stated that her
father and mother know only that she is a government employee,
They are not interested in the Agency or Department where
she or her husband is employed. Subject also advised that
although her landlady and Sears Roebuck Department Store know

her as CIA she is not aware that anyone else knows.

2. Mr. O'Neal asked what could be done about this

situation. Mr. Means said that Subject's husband is in
exico under Light state|cover but had previously been 32

backstopped firmly as a contract employee of the Department SC
of State, Escort Branch, Division of Language Services,\ He
said he would firm up this backstop so that in the event of x
inquiry at that |Division of. State\it would be confirmed that 22
he is in Mexico on an assignment. Mr. [Woodward \stated that 7
he would provide a U.S, Army | Translation Unit|\cover for >
Mrs. TARASOFF retroactive to her entrance on duty. The.
undersigned stated that he would conduct expedite credit
checks’on the Subject and’ Her husband to ascertgin whether or
not they Had been recorded as Agency employees.

6. It was agreed among the conferees that since the
father of Subject was unwitting of-Subject's CIA employment
he would not be specially briefed on what to answer in the
event that the question was asked in connection with his
VISA application. It was agreed that not knowing the specific
Department of Government he would have to consult his daughter
and then she could give the cover which had been prepared for
her. The undersigned pointed out the possibility that Subject's -
father might know of Subjects employment but it was agreed
that in view of his age and background it was very improbable
and that it would be better not to brief him specifically
on Subjects employment but to let the question be handled
naturally.
