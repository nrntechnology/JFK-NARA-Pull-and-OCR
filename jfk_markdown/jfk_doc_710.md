Dear Sir:

Reference is made to your lether of December 18th,
1975 concerning our client, Mitchell Livingston
WerPell,, III and his request for information under
the Freedom of Information Act.

I am enclosing a notarized statement providing you
with the address and place of birth of Mr, WerBell.

With regard to your last paragtaph asking for clari-
fication as to which records he desires to have
searched, we, of course, are not familiar with your.
files or filing system, Mr. WerBell spent sometime
in the United States Army. during World War II and

has traveled extensively since that time. He was in
Cuba at the time of the Castro military operation,

in the Dominican Republic during that military opera-
tion and in Thailand and Viet Nain during the Viet Nam
War. We feel quite confident your office must have
extensive files and documentation concerning Mr. Wer-
Bell and this request for information is intended to
