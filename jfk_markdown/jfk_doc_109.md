1. GENERAL

a. Elemental in the conduct of clandestine operations is the use of of human
gents to accomplish the missions of the Operations Directorate. In gen-
eral, it it is DDO policy to select agent assets with primary regard to the
agents’ abilities, target access, and secur security, and with few restrictions as
to their origins, professions or status’ as members of particular groups. The
basic rule is that any consenting adult may be used by. the Operations
Directorate. There. are, however, certain ‘sensitive categories of individuals

. Or groups whose operational use by the Operations. Directorate is prohibited »”

- or, in some. way: restricted for reasons not necessarily. ‘elated. to security.

considerations. - es vee fe eee a

b. These prohibitions or restrictions stem from one of the following:

(1) The Agency has been directed by .U.S. Governtienta authority to
restrict or avoid the operational use of a parti ilar category, of in-
dividuals. :

(2) The Agency has entered into a sp
organization, government, co:
category of individuals,<\

(3) The Director or the Depi

a. GENERAL. There are two categories of ¢ contract personnel contra contract ct employees . |

r53. CONTRACT PER

and independent contractors,

(1) CONTRACT EMPLOYEES. Although “they are not appointed employees,

contract employees are are employees of the U.S. Government. They have all

. the rights and privileges granted by law to U.S. Government employees

’ . yo, : : "im accordance with their citizenship, status as well as those rights and

privileges specified, in their contracts. They work under supervised con-

oo: rr ny ditions and are compensated on .a- salary. basis. Contract employees are
grouped Into three categories: :
(a) Career Associate (Type C) Contract Employees: Contract employees
who perform duties, usually of a clandestine and operational nature,
‘on @ career basis. They are normally required to demonstrate their
operational value to the Agency for not } han three years, in the
case of US. citizens, or not less thanfiv , in the case of foreign
nationals, to qualify for career associate) . When it is necessary
for a carger associate to have ‘thes stafl-type a cess to.an Agency instal-

. . lation or RC t fematlor ‘he ‘must meet the same security ape
Se : . _o proval crit ee tatt employee. :

ee |” lations. They” are required t to meet’ the same ‘security approval ‘eriteria.
_ (as statt ‘employees, b put are “permitted only such access to classified
.. Information as Is autharized in their security ‘spproval and is required
«in the performance ‘ot their duties, :
(e) External (Type E) Contract Employees: ‘Contract "employees, engaged
for a specific period of time, who normally work outside Agency in-
stallations. They are not required to meet the same. security approval
eriterla as staff employees and are not permitted the same access
to Agency installations as staff employees or Internal contract em-
ployees. They are permitted only such access to classified information
as is authorized In their security approval and is required in the per-

formance of their duties.

« . (2) INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS are not employees of the U.S. Government,
. They are self-employed { individuals who are engaged under contract to
provide specific services. They receive only the compensation and benefits
_considered necessary to retain their services, In the Operations Directorate,
their duties are normally limited to historical research and analysis and,
- to the direction, utilization, spotting, or support of agents. They normally -
do hot carry out espionage or covert action tasks. (Care must be taken _
. to distinguish between independent contractors, defined herein, and agents,
