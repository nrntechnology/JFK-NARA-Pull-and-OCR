MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director for Operations

THROUGH: MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Amendment and Termination of Project
KDFACTOR

1. Project KDFACTOR supported a visual and photo-
graphic surveillance operation in Mexico City targetted
against the Soviet Embassy. Asscts included five agents
and two baschouse surveillance sites. Termination of
this project, effective 30 June 1972, was the result of
a security review which revealed that the VWBLANKET
principal knew the basic details of Lhe KDFACTOR opera—

tions.

i: 2. Agent termination was accomplished without any
immediate difficulties; however, continued security will

. depend on the terminated agents’ silence. In the event
there is a compromise, the risk of damage to the Sta-

tion's relations with the Mexican Government should be
minimized because of the compatible nature of KDFACTOR? 8

operations,

3. The ADDO approved Amendment No. 1 to the proj-
ect in the amount of $9,844 for FY 1972 to provide for
the agent terminations, but an overrun of $7,246 oc- ©
curred as the result of miscalculation of termination’
costs. This project action requests this additional -
sum of $7,246 to cover these expenses, oo

4. The FI Staff recommends approval of this amend~

ment/termination request.

‘MEMORANDUM FOR: Associate Deputy Director

For Operations

SUBJECT : “Project KDFACTOR - Amendment
: and Termination Request, ~

1, The KDFACTOR Project (until 1970 encrypted
as the LIEMPTY Project) was initially approved in
1958 to provide financial and material support for
visual and photographic surveillance operations
targetted against the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City. In June 1972 the project supported five
agents and two basehouse surveillance sites,

2. The KDFACTOR Project was approved by the
AbpC in the amount of $19,000 for FY - 72 and
$20,000 for FY - 73, Per DIRECTOR 285255, dated
30 June 1972, the ADDO approved Amendment ND. 1
to the KDFACTOR Project in the amount of $9,844
for FY - 72 to provide for cests of agent
terminations.

3. The decision to terminate all agents and
facilities under the KDFACTOR Project was based
on a security review of the project activities
which indicated that the VWBLANXET principal knew
the basic details of the KDFACTOR operations,
including the target, the location of the surveillance
sites, and probably the true names and former
cryptonyms of the agents covered by the project. 4

4, The cost of terminating the agents under the
KDFACTOR Project amounted to $15,573; the cost of
closing down, the two basehouses under the project
was $1,412, The total amount charged to the KDFACTOR
Project in FY 72 was $36,090 which is $7,246 over
the approved authorization of $28,844. The overage
was incurred in terminating the agents and
facilities associated with the XDFACTOR Project.
Although Amendment No. 1 to the project was
approved in the amount of $9,844 to cover the
cost of terminating the agents in the

Freject, the actual payments made by Mexico City
Station per the terms of cach Memorandum of Oral .
Cemmitment (MOC) and in accordance with Mexican

law and custom exceeded the estimate for termination
costs made by Headquarters at the time the Améndment

\Was requested. Termination payments made to each

agent aré as follows: .
KDFACTOR-2 (Recruited 1956) $8,160

KDFACTOR-5 (Recruited 1956) 2,366
KDFACTOR-6 - (Recruited 1956) 2,830
KDFACTOR-8 (Recruited 1965) - 649
KDFACTOR-9 (Recruited 1966) 1,568

The long tenure of three of the terminated
agents, the relatively high monthly salary of
KDFACTOR-2 ($440) plus the computation of the
termination payments in accordance with Mexican
iaw and custom were the primary reasons that the
final agent termination costs amounted to $15,573.

S. All agent terminations were accomplished
in an amicable manner. No visible security risks
were apparent at the time of the terminations
although any one, or all, of the terminated agents
may at some future date decide to divulge to an
interested party the details of the KDFACTOR Project
operations, KDFACTOR-2, KDFACTOR-S, and KDFACTOR-6
have worked in photo surveillance operations for
the Station since 1956 and, therefore, obviously
have considerable knowledge of targets, former
satesites, personnel, and modus operandi of the
Station, However, since the KDFACTOR Project was
not concerned with incompatible operations or
targets, we believe the risks of damage to Station
relations with the Mexican Government in the event
of exposure of the KDFACTOR Project operations by a
terminated agent are within acceptable limits.

6. It is requested that the KDFACTOR Project
be amended to provide the sum of $7,246 for FY -
T2 to cover the costs of terminating five agents
and two basehouse surveillance sites under this

preject.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Renewal of Project KDFACTOR
. in 1972 for $19,000

in 1973 for $20,000

1. This project covers photo and visual surveillance
of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. One observation
post covers the front gate of the building,and another
covers the rear gate and walled compound. Five salaried
agents man the sites. four in front and one in back. An
official cover case officer collects the take (rolls of
film and logs of visitors) once a week by car meetings
with the OP keepers. The films are developed and printed
inside the Station.

2. The productioa from this operation has consis~
tently been rated-high by the Bureau (which is the prin-
cipal customer in the field), by other Government agencies
and by SB Division. Photosurveillance of a Soviet Embassy
might not be a high priority target in some countries.

But the fact that the Soviet Embassy in Mexico is a large
and active one and the fact that its primary target is

_Operations against the United States make our effort

important and valuable. This is the operation that pro- This Th WY

duced the photographs of Lee Harvey Oswald visiting the
Soviet Embassy in 1962.

3. This seemingly straightforward operation has not
always been so uncomplicated. Both sites have been in
operation and served by the same OP keepers for more than
a dozen years. At one of the sites the OP keeper's wife
and children take turns manning the equipment. A now-
terminated principal aseut was divorced several years

ago from-a wife who knew a lot about the operation. Some
desk officers believe that the medical doctor who for

years was supposed to be developing the films was simply
too busy to do so and that the work was probably done by
his uncleared secretary. Family relationships keep
cropping up among supposedly compartmented agents. All
of this is in the files but not in any one place. We

ervor ,

th

D/ZG,

‘ ,believe it is time for the Station to make an updated
j security review of the operation with particular attention

to the knowledgeability of terminated agents and their
families. We also believe that the Station should now
address itself to the contingency that the present sites
or personnel will be blown and to investigate alternative
means of continuing their valuable coverage.

4. The ADDP last approved this project in May 1970

. with the condition that termination payments to the

principal agent and his divorced wife be made on a
monthly basis. This condition has been met.

5. The budgets requested for the next two years are
simple and straightforward. Salaries and the traditional
bonuses for the five paid agents come to about $13,000.
Rent and utilities on the two observation posts come to
$5,600. The small balance is for operational expenses.
This project-action also requests amendment of the FY
1971 budget by $4,260 to cover that part of the cost of
termination bonuses to the principal agent and his di-
vorcéed wife which could not be absorbed by the project.
The total of the termination bonuses was $12,500.

6. This is a valuable and productive project which
helps fulfill a Priority A-1 Station requirement. The

FI Staff recommends approval,

Changes:
1. The processing of photographs obtained through this
project now is performed inside the Station. KDFACTOR-1, who
formerly processed the take in an outside safehouse, was
terminated amicably in early March 1971. Security and effi-
ciency have been increased by this change. ~ KDFACTOR-7 was
terminated in 1970, but the termination payments were made
during FY 1971 causing an increase in that years obligations.

2. Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of this
project to early April 1971 when project responsibility
reverted from the Operations Support Section to the REDTOP
Section. At that time Timothy H. ARCHBOLD assumed the inside
administrative supervision, and agent meetings were turned
over to the outside case officer Bruce H, FERNALD, When
ARCHBOLD departed PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS
assumed responsibility for this project, including agent

meetings.

Accomplishments:

1. This project has provided continuous daily photo-
graphic and visual coverage of personnel and vehicles entering
or leaving the Soviet Embassy. A total of 530 rolls of Film
were produced during the reporting period. U.S. citizens,
visitors, and TDY personnel are given special attention. Iden-
tifications of license plates and automobile descriptions as
well as drivers and their companions are identified under this
project. Additionally, attendance sheets are maintained to
establish who is at the Embassy on any given day and hour.

SECRET -2-

These photographs, and reports have contributed olerattonal
support to the Station's Soviet operations which is not
attainable elsewhere. For example, whenever the Soviets
change all their license numbers the Station is able to
compile a new, complete roster within a matter of weeks.

Costs: : ;

1. General: $19,000 is requested for FY 1972 and
$20,000 is requested for FY 1973. It is also requested
that the Project be amended for FY 1971 in the amount of
$4,260 ‘to provide for the termination of KDFACTOR~1 and

KDFACTOR-7.

Purpose: feet :
: Projoct LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic
surveillance of the Soviet’ Embassy in Nexico City. The

aim is to identify. and cover the movezents of persons
centering and leaving the Embassy, including Soviets and
visitors. The intelligence collected through such activity
contributes to ‘the Station's overall Soviet operations
‘Program, mainly in support of Priority A-l, but to some
extent, Priority A-4, of the Operating Directive for Mexico,

Description:

. le The Project ‘operates’ “through two fixed basehouse
surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a
principal ‘agent, and six sub-agents. A team of four sub-
‘agents, operating from a basehouse, maintains yisual and
: . .photographic- surveillance of the Soviet Embassy front
pe, ~ “entrance, One: Sub-agent, operating from a second base~
pool ~Nouse, covers an, area in back of the Bndassy, where Soviet
>. Vofficials meet, play: and work. These units photograph all
ff oC " “persons moving in or out of the specific target areas, They
i . ‘also. maintain logs and provide written reports on observed
‘activity. . All of this material is passed to the principal
agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for process-
‘ing “at a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the.
film is processed and pyinted, the principal agent passes
4 the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the
“fos 3+" Station case officer. A brief description of each unit,.
7 each agent and his role in the operation follows,

ations program.

the Soviet Embassy in-Mexico City. Similarly, an AF/OSI
controlled agent scheduled to mect a Soviet contact was
\ unable to do so owtng to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed

_ 7... perSon is beliévad''to.-be the agent's Soviet case officer. ,
ok Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI and
ie the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations

against the Soviets in Mexico,

- 3. Within one weok after a biannual change of license
plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a ~
‘complete list of the hew tag numbers, along with a complete
identification of the vchicles., Among other things, this
enabled the Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich NIKITIN, a known KGB officer, during his

last few days in Mexico,

: : 4. LIEMPTY has also dotormined that newcomers to the
. Soviet Embassy frequently gravitate to groupings with their
-RIS colleagues in the "“safoty" of the Embassy backyard.
This fact enabled the Station.to make certain tentative
KGB and GRU identifications, In addition, certain TDYers
have been linked up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited,

3. In the field of Sovict patterns of activity and

associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurate

. changes in certain specific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
that NIKITIN, mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his
activity pattern following the defection of Raisa
Yerofeyevna KISELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
Mission in Mexico, The same applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO,
a Second Secretary at the Embassy and a known KGB officer.
LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAKOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, a known GRU
officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a
suspect KGB officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a
“restricted area" at the Soviet Embassy and also established

-.:, who some of his associates were. In the case of Oleg

* Konstantinovich IGNATYEV, who had arrived in Mexico City

' from Caracas, Venezuela, LIEMPTY was able to observe ‘
IGNATYEV entering and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav
Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press ‘Attache and First Secretary of
the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEV also visited the Soviet Embassy

several other times during his stay in Mexico City and
had Gontact with other known. Soviet intelligence officers
while visiting. This kind of information is a basic
contribution to the Station's continuing efforts to
identify and assess certain Soviets for possible

- recruitment or defection,

6. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
“LIEMPTY - photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Embassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector cases. ‘The LIEMPTY material also
keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Embassy, which ones have
been away; who has used which car; who has been in contact
with whom; and other similar information useful in the
conduct of Soviet operations,

Problems:

1. A security problem has developed involving
Raymond H. GERENDE, According to GERENDE, his wife wants
a divorce, apparently based mainly on incompatabi lity of
personalities. The problem basically is that both want
custody of the children and this has sparked a dispute oo.
that has become more bitter and violent daily. In addition,
the monetary settlement ig in dispute. The problem is oo
compounded by the fact that GERENDE's wife knows in-some
considerable detail of GERENDE's activities on behaif of
the Agency. Thus, if the case does go to court, it could
lead to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and

possible compromise of LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP,

Even if the case does not go to court, GERENDE's wife could
expose him as an Agency cmployee. Since late 1969, Mexico
City Station has been in touch with both GERENDE and his
wife on this problem, and every effort is being made by
the Station to-have both parties settle the divorce out of
court, and to protect GERENDE's cover and that of the
project. After weighing all factors, it has been decided
that continued employment of GERENDE is not an acceptable
risk, and the decision has been reached to terminate him
by the end ef FY 1979. GERENDE will be paid a termination
bonus of $10,000 for 15 years service, about $1,250 more
than the $8,750 his contract calls for, in order to ensure
that the termination is amicable and thereby preserve

“project security. In addition, his wife, LIEMPTY-19 will
be given $2,500 as a security measure designed to keep her

“. from revealing what ‘She knows about project operations.

The FY i io budget is’ being amended to cover this amount, .

2. Other aspects of security continue relatively
unchanged... All the agents still have jobs to backstop
their Agency wages. The Station is compartmented from
the action agents through FERNALD, whose contact with the
sub-agents is reasonably well covered by his status as a
retiréd immigrant. FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9 and
LITEMPY-13 since 9 December 1969, Brief meetings are held
once each week at pre-arranged times and places, well away
from the target area. Occasionally emergency meetings are
called, by phone, if special coverage is desired. FERNALD
also meets LIENPTY-4 to exchange films and prints. These
meetings are held weekly at pre-arranged times and places.
FERNALD can change meeting plans by calling LIEMPTY-4
direetly by telephone, In addition, LIEMPTY-4 has been
given a special extension in the Station through which he
may call as "Dr. Carios" to leave a message for "Victor"
(FERNALD). The Station case officer maintains weekly clan-
destine contact with FERNALD in order to manage the oper-

ation and collect the product,

Coordination:

Ambassador McBride has not been briefed on Project
LIEMPTY,

Future Plans:

1. The surveillance units are expected to continue to
“+ produce valuable information in the form of photographic
coverage and visual surveillance reports on the daily
movements, personal associations, and habit patterns of
persons frequenting the Soviet Embassy, including Soviet
officials. Operational procedures and the project mecha-
nism will continue as it has in the past, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD, a new principal agent, will be in charge of the
operation isee Changes, paragraph *2),

2, The Project does not include an uy»dated plan for
emergency contact during violent action or government over-
throw. The Station has been requested to prepare an up-
dated emergency contact plan and submit it to Headquarters

-in the first FY 1971 quarterly progress report.

Purpose: : |

Project LIis@TY suggorte 2 yigual and photographic
gurveillance of the Sovict Exbussy in Mexico City. The
aim is to identify and cover the noverenta of pyrsons
entering and leaving the Rabassy, including Soviets and
visitors. The intelligence collectod through euch activity
contributes to the Station's overall Soviet operations
program, mainly in support of Priority A-1, but to some
extent, Priority A-4d, of the Operating Directive for Mexico.

Description:

1. The Project operates through two fixed basehouse
surveillance posts, a small photographic laboratory, a
principal agent, apd six sub-agenta. A team of four sub-
agents, operating Irom a basehouse, maintains visual and
photographic surveiliance of the Soviet Embassy front
entrance. Ono sub-agent, operating from a second dase-
house, coverd an aren in back of the Embassy, where Soviet
officials meet, play and vork. These units photegraph all
persons moving ip or out of the specific target areas, They
also maintain logs and provide sritten reports on observed
activity. All of thia material ig passed to the pripcipal ”
agent, who passes the film to another sub-agent for process-
ing at a laboratory equipped for that purpose. After the
‘film is processed and printed, the principul agent passes
the finished product, plus written reports and logs, to the
Station case officer. <A brtef description of each unit,
each agent and his rolo in the operation follows.

- 2. LILYRIC (MKXI-132) is a basehouse located near
the front of the Soviet Embassy. This house has been in

‘ operation since October 1966. It is rented through
‘LIMOUSINE (201-5762), © cleared American businesenan. He

4g the ostensible owner of record and, as tho landlord,
collects rent frob. the tenants and then passes it to the
Station case officer, LIENPTY-13 and his family (see
paragreph 3 below) live in the LILYRIC house and conduct
their survoillance operation from it during daylight hours

(0800-1800).

3. LIEMPTY-13 (201--119961) is the key member of the
LILYRIC basehouse tean., He maintains contact with the
principal agent and does sone photographic work. However,
because LIEMPTY-13 is employed outside os an induntrial
engineer, he is unable to spend much time operating the
LILYRIC photographic oquipment, and most of this work is
gone by his wife, LIEMPTY-14, and their sons, LISMPTY-26
and LIEMPTY-27 (see paragraphs 4, 5 and 5 bolow).

4. UIENPTY~14 (201-167567) is the main photographer
and observer at the LILYRIC basehouse. She works closely

with her husband, LIEMPTY-13, ip runping. the operation,
including the preparation of observation roports and logs.

“She also does the LILYRIC housekeeping, as any housewife

would do.

5. LYSMUPTY-26 (201-762111), the gon of LIXMPTY-13 and
LIEXPTY-14, has been a atudent at the Nexican Tochnoloyical
Inatitute. In his sparo time ho operatesthe LILYRIC phote~

and LIEXPTY-14, has been a prep school student. He assists
in operating the LILYRIC photographic equipment and tran-
ascribes notes into a finished typewritten log of events.

7. LICALLA (HEXI-03) is a basehouse located behind
the Soviet Eubsssy. It his been in operation since 1957.
The building, a four-unit affair, collectively known as
LIHUST, is Agency owned. It was purchased through
LIMOUSINE in Soptermber 1957, and the property ie in his

9. Raysiond H, GERENDE (201~119523) has been the
princtpal agent for this project. Ile ig a Mexican national
contract agent who is self-employed as an English teacher

and also works as a salesman for a light bulb manufacturer,

GERENDE ‘has been mainly responsible for maintaining contact
with the LIEMPTY agents, paesing instructions to them, and
collecting the product for passing to the Station case
officer. He has also paid them and handled all other
administrative matters. He is being terminated by the end
of FY 1970 for security reasons (see Problems, paragraph 1).

10. Bruce Hl, FERNALD (P) (201-008189) replaced
GERENDE (see parngraph 9 above) as the project's principal
agent in early December 1969. FERHALD, a U.8. Citizen born
in June 1915, operates under non-official cover as a retired
immigrant. He is responsible for maintaining contact with
the LIEMPTY agents and collecting the product for passing
to the Station case officer. ile algo handles administrative
matters, including agent salary ‘payuents. FERNALD is
financially covered under Project AEMAGNIFY.

12, The LIEMPTY photographic laboratory (MEXI-137) is
located in a room at GERENDE’s residence. It is equipped
to process the photographs taken by the LIEXPTY surveillance
units. The work ia done by LIEMPTY-4. (See paragraph 12
below). Since GERENDE will be terminated by the end of
FY 1970, the Station is taking steps to establish a new
LIEMPTY photograpndic laboratory at a new safesite.

Changes: ‘ \
\
1, The LIENTRAP mobile unit, consisting of LIEMPTY-10 ©
and LIEMPfY-11, is being removed from Project LIEMPTY and
placed under Project LIEMBRACE, which supports a unilateral
physical surveillance team... The purpose of this change is
to increase the size of the LIEMBRACE team in order to meet
a growing demand for operational surveillance support from
the various Station operating sections. The transfer will
become effective at the beginning of FY 1971 and both |
FY 1971 project budgets have been adjusted to cover financial

‘aepects of the change.

2, Raymond H, GERENDE was renoved as the LIEMPTY
principal agent in early December 1969 owing to a security
problem (see Problema, paragraph 1). He was replaced on
9 December 1969 by Bruce H, FERNALD, a career agent oper-
ating ‘under cover ag a retired immigrant. The change has
caused some delay in the receipt of photographs because
FERNALD is unable to meet LIEMPTY agents as frequently as
GERENDE had met them, but operational effectiveness is not
Significantly reduced by this delay. The key issue is that
security and reliability of the principal agent have improved

considerably.

Accomplishments:

1. Project LIEMPTY has provided continuous daily
photographic and visual coverage (Monday through Saturday)
of the front entrance and rear arens of the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City. All Soviet personnel and their visitors
entering or leaving the Embassy have been photographed, | In
addition, visual surveillance reports were prepared when
appropriate, These photographs and reports have contributed
essential operational support to the Station's Soviet oper-

ations progran.

2, Recently, LIEMPTY photographs were exclusively used
to produce an updated mugbook on Soviet officials in Mexico.
The book has been loaned to the FBI, AF/OSI and the 903nd
Military Intelligence Group for operational use in debriefing
thelr agents engaged in dangle operations and double agent
operations against the Soviet services in Mexico City. One
902nd controlled agent was identified from an LIEMPTY photo-
graph taken when the agent tried to contact the Soviets at

14-00000_,

ne

‘the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. 8imilarly, an AF/OSI

controlled agent scheduled to mect a Soviet contact was
unable to do so owing to illness, but LIEMPTY photographed
another: person who appeared at the meeting site and this
person is believed to bo the agent's Soviet cese officer.
Such coverage has been helpful to the 902nd, AF/OSI apd

the FBI in running their controlled double agent operations

against the Soviets in Hoxico. . r

3. Within one week after a pisnpuel change of licenzse
Plates on Soviet Embassy vehicles, LIEMPTY had provided a

‘complete list of ‘the now tag numbers, slong with a complete

identification of the vehicles. Among other things, this
enabled tho Station to identify the companions of Aleksandr
Aleksandrovich HIKITIN, a known KGB officer, during hie

last few days in Mexico.

4. LIEMPTY has also determined that newcomers to the
Soviet Embassy frequently gravitsto to groupings with their
RIS colleagues in the "safety" of the KEubassy backyurd,.
This fact enablod the Station to make certain tentative
KGS and GRU identifications. In addition, certain TDYers
bave been linked up with their escort officers and clues
to personal relationships have occasionally been exploited.

5. In the field of Soviet patterns of activity and
associations, LIEMPTY has been able to report accurste
changes in certain apecific cases. LIEMPTY coverage showed
that NIKITIN,: mentioned in paragraph 3 above, changed his
activity pattern following the defection of Raiea
Yerofeyevnn KIBELNIKOVA, former secretary in the Commercial
Bission in Mexico, Tho sume applies to Oleg NECHIPORENKO, .
a Second Secrcotary at the Rebassy and a known KGB officor.
LIEMPTY also provided information on the patterns and
associations of Yuriy Viktorovich KUPLYAXOV, a known KGB
officer and on Valeriy Vladimirovich SOKOLIN, « known GRU
officer. Coverage of Vladimir Viktorovich GORDEYEV, a

‘suspect KGB officer, showed that he did, in fact, work in a

“restricted area” at the Soviet Embassy end also established
who sone of his associates were. In thé case of Oleg
Konstaentinovich IGNATYEY, who had arrived in Hexico City
from Caracas, Venezuela, LIRHPTY was ablo to observe
IGNATYEV entoring and leaving in the company of Svyastoslav—
Fedorovich KUZNETSOV, Press Attache and First Secretary of
the Soviet Embassy. IGNATYEVY also viesitud the Soviet Hmbassy

several other tises during his stay in Mexico City and
had contact with other known Sovict inteiligence ofileers
while visiting. This kind of inforsation ig a basic
contribution to the Station's cortiauing efforts to
identify and agsese certain Soviets for possible
recruitment or defection.

6. At Headquarters, the Soviet Bloc Division uses
LIBMPTY photographs, particularly photographs of Soviet
Embassy officials, for identification purposes in con-
nection with defector eases. The LIEHPTY material also
keeps the Station's Soviet section up-to-date on which
Soviet officers have been in the Snbassy, which ones Save
been away; who has used shich car: sho has been in contact
with whom; and other similar infornation useful in the
conduct of Soviet operations,

Operational Support Project, LIEMPTY, fox $23,635 for Fiscal
Yéar 1971 and a $10,498 amendment for FY 1970 to cover termine

ation payments to a former Principal Agent and his wife. Last

year LIEMPTY was approved for $38,970. One agent termination
and the transfer of the cost of a mobile surveillance unit to
another project are responsible for the reduced FY 1971 request.

2. ‘LIEMPTY supports a visual and photographic surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, It includes a
Principal Agent, Raymond H, GERENDE (P), and 6 subagents who
maintain two separate safehouses, one in front and one in
the rear of the Soviet Embassy, from which anyone entering or
leaving the Embassy can be observed and photographed. The
various members of. the team handle and service the photographic
equipment, develop: and print photographs, keep observation
reports.and logs, including the arrival and departure of tar~
get persons, and maintain the two safehouses mentioned above.

3. This project does not provide positive intelligence,
except incidentally. It is designed to furnish a running
‘account, both photographic and in writing, of all Soviet
Embassy personnel and their visitors arriving at, or leaving,
the Embassy, Photographs taken by LIEMPTY personnel were
used to produce an updated "mugbook" on Soviet officials in
Mexico which has been loaned to other US security agencies
for operational use in activities targeted against Soviet
services in Mexico City, LIEMPTY agents also provided infor-
mation which enabled the Station to identify the companions of
known KGB officials, to identify the habit patterns of new
arrivals at the Soviet Embassy and provided a wealth of other
information of operational value concerning Soviet Embassy

activities,

4. A security problem, resulting in a Station decision
to restrict the activities of GERENDE, place him on half pay,
and replace him with a career agent (a valuable asset who

there is no assurance that she will do so. In view of the
risk Anvolved, should ‘GERENDE'’s wife expose hia agency rela-
° tionship and in view of the fact that, despite his 15 years
of service and his undisputed ability and experience, other
unfavorable qualities militate against his retention, the
Station ig considering terminating GERENDS, It is proposed
to pay him a termination bonus of $10,000 for 15 years of
service in accordance with Mexican Iaw and his wife $2,500 as
a security measure designed to keep her quiet. After discus-
~~ --~-gijon with the desk, FI Staff believes that, if GERENDE is .
paid the $10,000 termination money, it should not be given to y
him in one lump sum but should be paid on a monthly basis, Vv
the amount per month to be determined by the Station, thus
eliminating the possibility of his squandering it all at
once and possibly coming back for more of the same, The same
procedure should be followed in the $2,500 payment to his
wife. In bof¢h cases at least an element of control is
’ assured in that both GERENDE and his wife will know that con-
‘tinued receipt of their monthly payments will depend upon
their continued loyalty to the agency, in the meantime, we
feel this man, whose morale, and ability have been seriously
affected by his marital strife, given time, can perhaps be
rehabilitated and once again become a valuable Station asset,
This would ensure his continued loyalty and give him an income
out of which to pay his alimony, Aside from the foregoing
_ there were no other problems, security or otherwise. All
ast meetings between the case officer and the new Principal Agent
are held under secure conditions, or more often if necessary,
at prearranged dates, times and places. Meetings between the
P/A and the sutagents are held under similar conditions. The
- Station has been requested to submit an updated emergency re-
contact plan to be included in the first FY 1971 quarterly

program report for this project.

MEMORANDUN FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans _
THROUGH = -:._‘MPS/BG
SUBJECT = :_—«FY :1970 Renewal of Project LIEMPTY for $38,970

1. Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh year, is the Mexican
Station's operation which provides visual and photographic surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy from safehouses at the front entrance
and back of the building, as well as from a mobile unit. All Soviet
personnel and their visitors coming to the Embassy are photographed.
From 1 November 1967 to 31 December 1968, approximately 21,367 photo-
graphs were taken and thousands of pages of surveillance reports were
completed by personnel .in this project. SB Division is pleased with
the quantity and quality of the photographs and the Station finds them
useful for operational purposes against the SB target. During the
past year several U.S. citizens entered the Soviet installation in
Mexico City and thetr photographs were identified by the FBI. There
is a good relationship between the Station and the FBI in Mexico City

- and appropriately sterilized photographs are passed locally.

2. There have been no ‘significant security problems. ©

3. The only changes in the project have been the elimination of
one of the safehouses, which was used as an observation post, and .
termination of the agent who attended it. No real loss resulted from
this change since the safehouse was so located that photographs taken
from it overlapped those taken from another safehouse. The agent who
serviced the facility was getting too old to do an efficient job and
was terminated amicably. Also during the past year a new agent was
added to the project.

4, Total funds requested for FY 1970 are $38,970. Salaries and
legally required bonuses for nine agents come to $30,080; safehouse
rental and maintenance amounts to $6,188; maintenance of two vehicles,
$1,200; and photo and operational expenses, $1,5C0. FY 1969 approval
was for $43,520 and-estimated obligations for this period are $43,500.
A new, $5,000 vehicle was purchased in FY 1969 and none is needed in
FY 1970 which accounts for the reduction in costs for the present year,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal (FY 1970)

1. Renowal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) in
the amount of $38,970, Funds are available in WH Division.

~ $45,000 was programmed for FY 1970.

: -2. LIYEMPTY is a project supporting Soviet operations
of the Mexico City Station, It provides for two baschouses,
a photo surveillance vehicle, and personnel for photographic
and visual surveillance of the Soviet Embassy. Presently,
two fixed surveillance points near the Embassy provide the
location from which the photographs are taken and observers

.are stationed, One basehouse is adjacent to the rear of the

Embassy; where Soviet officials meet, play and work. The
other basehouse is across the street from the front of the
Embassy and gives a direct view of every person entering or
leaving. There is also a mobile photographic unit (a VW

van) which is now used in support of all Mexico City Station
operations and in conjunction with the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team (used primarily against Soviet targets). Raymond H,

~ GERENDE, an indigenous contract agent, is the principal agent

of the operation and meets daily with the basehouse keepers
and subagents.

3. LIEMPTY contributes significantly to the Station's
Soviet operations program and is considered an essential

‘element of the Station's support apparatus. During the

period 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, approxi~
mately 21 7367 photographs were taken. In response to a
request to SB Division for an evaluation of the project, the
following comment was received: "There are few such sources
of high resolution photographs of Soviets, especially giving
good side views. These photos are welcomed by SB Division
Since they furnish a steady flow of up-to-date identity
cata..." The photos are useful to the Station in confirming
the identities of Soviet porsonnel and visitors to the

SECRET
SECRET

Embassy, some of whom are U. S, citizens. During the past
year, several of these U, S, citizens were identified with
the help of the photos (which were passed to the FBI).
Furthermore, the movements and habits of the Soviets are
studied, and more knowledge is acquired on their friends

and associates, especially Mexican nationals, This informa-
tion is useful in target studies. For example, the senior
TASS representative, a known KGB officer, is a recruitment
target. He is under intensive operational scrutiny for
leads developed from knowledge of his activities and contacts.
LYEMPTY support is an integral part of this current develop-

mental activity.” . : va

-. 4, During the past year, one of the three basehouses
was closed, leaving two, and the agent attending it was
terminated. This was done because the agent was becoming
less effective with age, and because there was some over-
lap between the photos taken from this basehouse and those
of another. The termination was amicable, and the working
hours of the personnel of the other basehouse were extended
slightly. Another agent was also hired to help, This new
agent is of the same family as the rest of the personnel
occupying the basehouse, and no additional security risks are

anticipated from this addition,

5, There have been:no security or administrative prob-
lems, The Station and GERENDS are constantly on the alert
for any sign that the Soviets are aware of the surveillance
activities, While it is quite possible that the Soviets are
. aware of the surveillance, so far indications are that they

are at least not fully aware, since no effort is made by
them to avoid being photographed, even when having meetings
with contacts in the rear of the Embassy.

6. Approval is recommended of this valuable operational”
support project.

ADD/P approval of renewal (19 mos.) 1 Dec 67 = 30 Jun 69°

An operational support project providing three basehouses and

Embassy, its personnel and its visitors, by physical and photo=
graphic surveillance.

BACKGROUND: ‘The project covers three properties near the Soviet Embassy ,

PROGRESS ;

FUNDS :

(two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance and one behind the
garden) from which visual and photographic surveillance is carried
out. It also covers a darkroom and a mobile photographic truck.
Some of the project personnel are used at times for miscellaneous
support tasks such as servicing postal boxes and for counter
surveillance and other protective services.

During the past year the project provided nearly all of the opera-
tional photographs ond physical surveillance reports used in the
Station's operations against the Soviet Embassy and its personnel.
SB Division says, "This rather unique operation has unquestionably
made a major contribution to the increasingly effective Soviet
Operations program of the Mexico Station.”

The project produces primarily operational data and counterintelli-
gence information. It provides leads, evidence of which Soviet
officers have been in the Embassy and which ones have been away,
who has used which car, who has been talking to whom or going out
of the building with whom. (One photograph from this project was “
used in the Warren Commission Report.)

MEMORANDUM FOR; Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

; : THROUGH: MPS/BG
SUBJECT: Project LIEMPTY

1. WH Division requests renewal of LIEMPTY for the
19~-month period 1 December 1967 through 30 June 1969 in
the amount of $69,725. While this represents a slight
reduction-on a pro rata basis from the $45,000 for which
_LIEMPTY was approved for the 12-month period starting
1 December 1966, it reflects a proportionately modest
inerease in cost for the 19-month renewal period over the
estimated total disbursement of $40,130 for the past
project year. This will provide for small salary increases

“- to meet the rising cost of living for certain of the agents
involved -in the project who have not received raises in
some time as well as for slightly higher rental fees for
the various basehouses. The project, now in its tenth
year, is designed primarily to provide for the collection
.of operational information on the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
-City, including the identification and movencnts of its
personnel and visitors. To this end, LIEMPTY: provides
for the maintenance and exploitation of threé basehouses
for fixed visual and photographic surveillance of the
Soviet Embassy and a mobile basehouse in the form of a.
panel truck used for mobile photography against the Polish
Embassy, leaders and mecting sites of local communist
parties, and other targets of opportunity. An important
corollary objective of LIEMPTY is operational support in
the form of countersurveillance for Agency personnel and
operations, including those of other bases and stations
as the needs and requirements of the Mexico Station permit.
The funds requested include $43,520 for the period 1
Décember 1967 through 30 November 1968 and an additional
$26,205 to cover the period 1 December 1968 through 30
June 1969, The latter funds are asked for in a supple-
mental request to put the project on a fiscal year basis.

2. <A long-term contract agent and eight other support
agents are involved in the management and operation of the
14-0000

LIEMPTY facilities and in surveillance activities directed
at the primary Sovict target. Some of these ayents are
used also’ in dark room photographic processing, letter
drop, and, on occasion, moving surveillance activities.

3. This project is only part of the complex:of
Mexico City Station instruments for meeting requirements
from a number of U.S. agencies, including the FBI. It “’
is clearly an effective, well-managed support operation

serving important needs.

4. No major or significant changes in LIEMPTY
personnel or operational techniques have been introduced
nor have there been any known incidents adversely
affecting. the. security of the project or its personnel
since the previous project renewal period. As a uni-
lateral operational support effort, LIEMPTY cont inues to
be a most useful station asset supporting a number of
station activities. In spite of small increases in costs
as discussed above, the project is considered to be .holding

the line on cost and personnel.

5. The objectives of project LIEMPTY are in direct
support of priority A objectives 1, 2, and 4 of the current
Operating Directive for Mexico. It is considered by SB
Division to have made significant contributions to the
Station's well developed, high priority Soviet Operations
Program. During the past year the various LIEMPTY base-
house installations produced valuable information in the
form of photographic coverage and Physical surveillance
reports on the daily movements, personal associations and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest.

In numerous instances this coverage confirmed the specific
intelligence service connections of Soviet officers in the
Embassy. Often the identities of Mexicans and nationals of
other countries in contact with the Soviets were estab-
lished. The mobile panel truck unit was exploited regu-
larly to provide information on not only the Soviets but
also the Cuban target as well as local Communist Party

targets.

PROJECT BRIEFING
PROJECT: LIEMPTY . WH - Mexico City
ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal 1 Dec 66 - 30 Nov 67

PURPOSE: Provides stationary surveillance against the Soviet Embassy
and a mobile photographic baschouse which is used primarily
against the Polish Embassy and local Communist party leaders,

: PROGRESS: Three. basehouses (LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA) pro-.

; vide coverage of both the front and rear of the Soviet Embassy,
Throughout the past renewal period cach operational component
contributed. actively and concretely to the fulfiliment of the
operational tasks levied on the Station, In the first nine-month
period approximately 17,000 individual frames of operational
photographs were provided from the fixed basehouses. These
served to confirm the identities of Embassy personnel and
their visitors and provided detailed reporting on the movement
and habit patterns of selected targets of special interest. The
mobile unit (LIENTRAP) provided over 1,000 individual photo-~-
graphs, Of particular value were photographs of local and
exile Communist leaders. Raymond H. GERENDE (p) continued
in the role as principal agent for Project LIEMPTY, His overall
operational assignment involved at least 12 clandestine mcetings
per week, in addition to his meetings with the LIEMPTY project

oan case officer,

PROBLEMS: In mid 1966 LICOWL/1, who owns a small store near the
Soviet Embassy, reported that a Soviet official had approached
him and asked him to inform on his neighbors, Reportedly the
Sovict named LIEMPTY/6 of the LIMITED basehouse by name
and also asked about the tenants of the building housing LILYRIC,
However, in view of LICOWL's previous history of lying, it is
difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets requested and just
what LICOWL/1 may have told them, The Station is still looking

into this development,

CISTAFF: Strongly urges the Station to continue its close
monitering of Soviet interest in the installation buildings and
. attempts to obtain information on sensitive project personali-
: ties. The Station should devise necessary contingency pians
of action to eliminate any security hazards if it is determined
that the Soviets are intensifying such efforts and could be
getting "too close" to the project installations, personalities
and activities,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1. It is requested that the LIEMPTY Project be
renewed for the period 1 December 1966 through 30
November 1967 for a total: of $45,000: $29,020 for
FY 1967 and $15,980 for FY 1968. The Project is in-

‘eluded in the FY 1967 Operational Program for $45,000.

Funds are available within WH Division.

2. LIEMPTY covers stationary surveillance base-
houses targeted against the Soviet Embassy. These
basehouses provide photographic coverage and logs. Two
of the basehouses (LIMITED and LILYRIC) cover the
activity in the front of the Embassy, and LICALLA provides
coverage of the back courtyard area, The LIEMPTY project
also covers a mobile photographic basechouse in the form
of a panel truck which is used against the Polish Embassy
where we have no permanent surveillance basehouse, and
against other targets. of opportunity.

3. The value of Soviet Embassy photographic cover~
age during the-past year was proven when the logs
maintained by LILYRIC were used to double check on-an
operation involving LIRUSTIC-1 and LICOWL-1 who had told
conflicting stories of certain events concerning the
activity of some Soviets. Through the surveillance
reports of the LIEMPTY Project against the Soviet Embassy,

’ it was proven without a doubt that LICOWL-1 (who had just

taken a polygraph without apparent deception) was lying
about his contacts with the Soviets.

4. The LIENTRAP mobile photographic basehouse was
targeted against leaders and meeting sites of the local
Communist parties as well as other targets of opportunity,
particularly exile Communist leaders now residing in

Mexico. LIENTRAP provided up-dated identification

photographs of Communist officers which are of value
to both the JNTIGER program and the Station's 1 4
recruitment/penctration program. The LIENTRAP ‘
personnel also regularly service twenty-one postal 4
Steere dation addresses used by the Mexico City a \
tation, : '

5.. One development which may affect the ‘security
of the LIEMPTY basechouses of LIMITED and LILYRIC
occurred in mid 1966 when LICOWL-1 (who owns a small .
. store near the Sovict Embassy) reported that a Soviet. ~
official, AEQUALITY-1, had approached him and | °
requested him to inform on his neighbors. Reportedly
the Soviet named LIEMPTY-6 (of the LIMITED basehouse {
by name and also indicated all the tenants (unnamed)
_of the new buitding which now houses LILYRIC, The :
Soviet pinpointed the building by saying the one being!
built by a person who fit perfectly the description of
LIMOUSINE, LICOWL-1 did not indicate that the Soviet -
reflected any interest in LIMOUSINE. The occupants of
the LILYRIC basehouse were not mentioned. LICOWL-1
indicated to his Station contact that the only person
he really suspected an the neighborhood was LIEMPTY-6
(of LIMITED) who doesn't go to work, is always typing,
' lives comfortably. and owns a car, He claims to have
Reard it rumored that LIEMPTY-6 was working for the
Americans. (Since LIMITED is equipped with a radio
and tips off the Station's surveillance team when it
‘is used against Soviet targets, Headquarters has |
already assumed that the Soviets have identified this
basechouse.) LICOWL-1 also listed several persons
named by the Soviet who had no connection whatsoever

with CIA,

6. The Station instructed LICOWL-1 not to become
an informant on his neighbors, According to LICOWL-1,
he therefore told AEQUALITY-1 he did not have time to
collect the information the Soviet wanted. However,
in view of the lies LICOWL-1 has been caught in, it
is difficult to assess exactly what the Soviets asked ‘
of LICOWL-1 and just what LICOWL-1 may have told the
Soviets.. The Station is still looking into this develop-

ment,
7. WHD recommends renewal of this Project.

ADD/P approval of renewal 1 Dee 65 - 30 Nov 66

To provide support for mobile and stationary photographic
surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and a dispatching base
for a physical surveillance team.

Assets included under the project include three base-
houses which provide front and rear views of the Soviet
Embassy, and a panel truck cquipped for spot photo
coverage. Raymond H. GERENDE (p), principal agent,
meets the baschouse keepers regularly, maintains regular
contact with the mobile photo unit and with the develope
ing and processing base. Hie also performs many other
support functions.

The phetographs from all these operations have been of
value to the Station in operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, and
for Headquarters permanent files. ‘The Station believes
that this operation is essential to the fulfillment of
the overall operational program levied on the Station by

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: DDP/PG
SUBJECT: ; Project LISMPTY Rereval

1. FI Staff recommends approval of the renewal of Project
LIEMPTY. This project, costed at $41,500., supports the following
Mexico City assets: a panel truck used for mobile photography,
three base houses for fixed photographic surveillance, a contract
agent manager and eight support agents. One of the base homes is
used as a control point to dispatch a surveillance tean. (the
latter is not a part of the project, however.)

2. The LIEMPTY target is the Soviet Embassy and Soviet
activities in Mexico City. LISMPTY is part of the complex of
station instruments by means of which requirements from a variety
of U.S. agencies are met. One cf the sites provided pictures
later used in the Warren Comission Report, and the publication
of the report created a security hazard. The Station moved the
site and it is now back in operation.

3. The possibility of Soviet intercept of radio commo to
the surveillance team has been carefully weighed recently by SR,
the desk, 0/C and TSD. The decision to accept the risk appears
to have been taken with due deliberation.

4. This is clearly an effective, vell-managed operation
serving an important need. we recomend renewal without hesitation.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT — : Project LIEMPTY Renewal Request

1. Renewal is requested for the LIEMPTY Project for
the period 1 December 1965 through 30 November 1966 for a
total of $41,500; of this amount, $25,520 should be
alloted for FY 1966 and $15,980 for FY 1967. This Project
has been programmed in FY 1966 for $50,000.. The last
Project Renewal was approved at $45,300. Funds are
available within WH Division,

2, The security of this Project appears to be good.

lle , The LIENTRAP photo truck was repainted a different color

. in January 1965 to preserve the security of this vehicle
which operates extensively in the same general areas, There

have been no apparent ramifications from the publication

of the LIMITED Photograph in the Warren Commission Report

in September 1964,

. 3. LIENTRAP is one of two mobile photo surveillance
-units at the Station, both of which are used extensively
because of the many requirements for spot photo coverage
of diplomatic installations, agent mectings, and current
identification photos of targets among others.

! "4, Although there are three stationary photo

baschouses under this Project all targeted against the
Soviet Embassy, there is very little duplication of
effort, and the coverage of this Embassy would be weakened

~ through the termination of any of them. LICALLA covers
the rear of the Embassy (garden and parking lot) and is
in a unique position to observe informal meetings and
activity there, In May 1965 a thorough assessment was
made of this basehouse to determine whether an audio
installation could be based here, directed against these
garden conversations, It was determined that due to the
high incidence of street and other noises, this was not
practical, TSD and SR Divisions are conscious of this
requirement, however, and if any new equipment is
developed which might make this operation more feasible
it will be tested, LIMITED and LILYRIC which both cover
the front entrance, provide coverage during different
parts of the day, and LIMITED also serves as a fixed radio

dispatching base for the LIENBRACE surveillance tean.

S$. The photographs from all these operations are of
value to the Station in their operational planning, for
identification by surveillance teams, for mug books, which
are often used by surveillance teams and singleton agents
in identifying Soviets, and for Headquarter's persanent

files.

6. With reference to the FI Staff comment made last
year at the time of the Project renewal that the radio dis-
patching from the LIMITED installation might have nade this
base a target for the RIS, the preblem was discussed in depth
with the Office of Comrunications, TSD, and SR Divisions,
The Statio: has been alert to the Soviet's monitoring capa-
bility and they have developed a signaling systen and inter
car communications system that will leave the LIEMBRACE
surveillance cars on the air for a ninimum of tine, and
with limited open conversation. The result of Headquarters
and the. Station's research on this problem resulted in the
conclusion that, if a surveillance team is to operate with
automobiles, radios must be used if there is to be efficient
surveillance, and regardless of what presently availak le
type of scrambling or coding is used, radio is susceptible
to monitoring by the opposition, It was therefore concluded
that if the Station is to use the LIEMBRACE team against
members of the Soviet installation, LIMITED must continue to
be used as the radio dispatching center and the risk factor
must be accepted until some new, more secure yet efficient
commo system is devised,

7. The reporting en the administration of this Project
is handled through regular quarterly progress reports, The
appropriate Soviet, CP, or other Case Officers handle the
reporting and exploitation of the product. During the past
year there were no ‘positive intellisence reports from this

Project,
8. Both SR and WH Divisions recommend renewal of this

Project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief ‘of Operations, DD/P
SUBJECT : Project LIEMPTY (Renewal)

WH ~ Mexico city

1. The attached project, originating in WH Division,
is presented for renewal for the period 1 December 1960
through 30 November 1961. The project provides for physi-
eal and photographic surveillance operations in support
and exploitation of other Mexico City Station operations,
particularly those targetted at Soviet personnel and in-
stallations. :

2. Authority is requested to obligate $53,000 from
the DD/P-WH Division budget: $31,900 in fiscal year 1961,
and $21,100 in fiscal year 1962, subject to the availabil-
ity of funds. The amount inciudes $38,C00 compensation
for two principal agents, one clerical support agent on an
hourly basis, and eleven surveillance and support agents;
$7,000 operational expenses (safehouse procurement, post
office boxes, rented automobiles, purchase of information,
vehicle maintenance, and cperational travel); $2,500 re-
placement, repair and maintenance of photographic equip-
ment; and $5,500 basehouse rental, utilities, and mainte-

nance.

3. The field's renewal request, supported by a cover-
ing memorandum of the Division, sets forth accomplishments
of the project in the past year in terms of objectives and
estimates effectiveness. It is noted that one principal
agent, Simon D. CLACKETT (p), resigned in October 1960, and
the four-man surveillance team previously handled by him
will be transferred to project LITEMPO, coirsequently being
omitted from LIEMPTY in this renewal. Three basehouses con-
tinue to be operated under the project: (a) LIMITED, which
compiles daily logs on arrivals and departures from the
LIMERICK installaticn, together with attendance lists of
LIMERICK employees, and handles the radio dispatch of the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team on LIMERICK personnel and targets

14-0000

g

of opportunity. This basehouse also provides photographic
coverage, concentrated on visitors, (b) LILYRIC which pro-
vides clandestine photegraphs particularly of visitors -to,
as well as employees of, the LIMERICK installation, prepares
weekly reports on LIMERICK emplcyees and their wives, and
reports on license numbers of sil cars visiting the instal-
lation. (c) LICALLA, which ccncentrates on photographic
coverage of LIMERICK employees and their families, as well
as providing observation on the apparent positions and jobs
of the target employees, and as well as personnel changes.
Additional photographic coverage is provided by the mobile
LIENTRAP vehicle. Principal agent Raymond H. GERENDE (p)}
continues to coordinate basehouse activities; princlpal
agent Oliver G. SCANTLING (p) ecntinues to be an independent
asset used to follow-up and exploit operational information
on target personnel and installations, to case various in-
stallations of interest, to acquire property, etc. SCANTLING
has managed the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO in the interim rollowing the resignation of CLACKETT.
The Station notes that activities at the LICALLA basehouse
were suspended in September 1960 as the result of the ar-
rest of a knowledgeable TSD technictan in another area and
it is not known precisely when it will be possible to re-
sume these operations. The Station believes that the
GERENDE segment is now operating under optimum arrangements
and SCANTLING will soon be relieved from his interim respon-
sibllity for the surveillance team being transferred to
LITEMPO and can concentrate more on his investigative and
easing activities. It is net planned in the coming year to
expand project activities.

4. Appropriate Special Staff comporents concur in rec-
ommending renewal. FI Staff notes the Division's assurance
that the transfer of the unilateral surveillance team to
LITEMPO will not affect its independent status, and remarks
that the current project review presents a clearer plcture
of the usefulness of the several segments than the previous

one,

Date: 23 June 1959

1. It is reqested that anvroval be granted to amend Raymond H. GSRENDS's
contract to vrovide him with a termination settlenent of one month's salary for
each full year that he works for KUBARK and to raise his salary effective July
1939 fron 3,009 to 34,560.00 per year. !is last salary increase was granted on

1 Sertenber 1657, The date, 18 b.arch 1955, has been sussested by the Station as
the beginning dite for the computation of GETNDE's termination benefits. The
Station believes that this benefit will nrovide GSRENDE with the necessary
‘incentive to make KUBARK a career and at the same time will give the Station an

additional elenert of control.

2. As pointed out in the LIGHPTY Project Aporeval, GERYNDE, an indigenous
agent, is one of the Station's most valuable assets. Ee has a responsible full
tine job as the LIS<PTY Princioal Agent whe handles the LINTT®D, LYLYIC and
LICALLA base heuses, the LISHTAAP oneration, the outside ohotographic processing
and translation service and all the agenta participating in these activities.

Re performs his duties in a conscientious and orofessicnal manner and his
already excellent abilities are showing continued improvement.

3. Money was already allocated in the LIZXPTY Project approval for the
salary increase, With the effective date of 13 March 1955, tor the termination
clause, GENSIIS will already have accrued 21,520 (his salary is ¢h,560 per year)
if he should resign today. The LIEMPIY Project, as asvroved, has sufficient
funds to cover this cost if it is necessary to obligate this amount during the
present Project year. Therefore, no atiditional funds are requested.

SUBJECT : Project LIsMPTY (Amendment)
WE - Mexico city

1. Tha attached project, originating in the WH Division, provides the
services of a surveillance activity to support Mexico City operations and
is approved for the period 1 December 1958 through 3C November 1959. It is

o presented for your approval of umendment to include the addition of a con-
tract agent, Louise J, MaCRINO, to furnish edninistrative support, and also
to formalize a special commitment made to one of the two principsl egents,
Oliver G. SCANTLING. 4 contract prepared in the Field und signed by the
agent permits the payment of one year's salary to him or his assigned heirs
in event of loss of life or total disability if incurred in the performance
of duty. This has vot previously been included in the project.

2. The LISMPTY project hes authorization for the expenditure of
395,380. No additional funds are required for the amendmeat. Sufficient
funds remain in the project to absorb the salary expenses for MACRINO and
funds to cover the extra year's salary for SCaNTLING will not be requested

until such time as they are needed,
3. Memoranda prepared in the iH Division supporting the recuest for

amendment are attached, summarizing the important factors involved. These
detail SCaNTLING's performance and provide a resume of MaCRINO's past activ-

ities in behalf of the Agency.

MEMOSANDUM FOR: Chief, FI HRADQUARTERS CASE OFFICER:

SUBJSCT t Amend LIZMPTY Project to Include a KAME_ J. 2B. Brady
Special Benefit for Oliver G. ROOM_@llh Barton Hal.

SCANTLING (pa) and to Include EXT.” 2555 or Sloe
Louise J. MACAItO (ps) DAls__ 5 March 1959

1. It is requested that approval be granted to give Oliver G. SCANTLING a
special benefit of one year's salary to him or his assigned heirs in the event of
loss of live or total disability if incurred in the performance of duty. This
benefit was included in a contract prepared in the field and signed by Subject on
15 February 1957. The contract was not submitted to Headquarters for approval
until Decenber 1955. The Station and WH Division do not want to delete this
benefit fron Subjact's contract at this tima and we feel Subject deserves this

benefite

2. SCANTLING, a civil engineer, is a Mexican citisen, who is 40 years old.
He was cranted sn Operational Approval on 2 December 19Sir2 SCANTLING bean his
employtent with XUSARK as a footman on tha LIPSTICK physical surveillance team and
gradually becane a driver of a surveiliance automobile, then team leader. As team
leader ha was responsible for the operational deployment and administrative direction
ot the entire LIPSTICK team, three automobiles, four photographic and radio dispatching
basehouses and the attendant mobile and stationary radio aquinment. He collated the
fragnentary surveillance reports into finished intelligence reports for study by the
Case Officar. SCANTLING developed into a fine investisator and has obtained infor-
mation where other Station investigative ascets hava failade

3. Almost all of SCAHTLING's time now is spent following up leads obtained
from telephone intercepts and photographic surveillances. From July through
December 1958 he made approaches to individuals performing services for tha Soviet:
Embassy and he nade a detailed casing report of the West German Embassy. In addition,
ha condcted many routine investigations and surveillances, The Station plans to |
have Sea: TLE i7G attempt to recruit the landlord of the proposed basehouse for a
LINISENT (FI/D) operation. SCANTLING no longer nandles thu surveillance team and the
Station plans to continue to use him as an independent asset. SCALTLING has in his
possession official credontials of the Federal Security Polico (DiS). He has used’
these credentisis in making contacts with targets of various sensitive Headquarterst

operations (i.e., LOMAYFOUL). a

he As a graduate engineer who has spent at least ten years in house construction
in Mexico, he nas been invaluable to the Station in submitting detailed casine reports
‘including detailed and professional plans of technical targets. He has been com-endad
by TSS for the supsort role he has played for them. He has submitted several casing
reoorts on the Soviet Smbassy and is an unparatleled source of information to the «
Station for inforsation about tho Embassy's construction activities, modifications :

and reasons for sane.

S. For your information there is attached the Station's review of SCANTLING |
for the period July through December 1958, It is telieved you will find tais resert
of interest and further support the justification octlined avove for tie granting to
SCANTLING of the special death and disability beneZit. This agent assessant states

~———*Oliver 0. SCANTLING nas continued to perform his assigned tasks in an outstanding

manner. SCANTLING's poise, comnon sensa, education, idvology, and native ability
for the pursuit of clandestine activities make him one of the moat valuable support
assets available to the Mexico City Station. The fact that SCANTLING has a fl)

- tine overt occupation as Chief Engineer and Production Manager for a local mame

facturing company adds to his long-range potentiai as a KUPAKK agent". SCANTLING
has excellent cover as half-owner of a local firm waist manufactures farm instru-
ments and he represents the high calibra of person waich KUEARK requires for the

institution of their long-term resident agent programe

7. It is also requested that effective 1 March 1839 the LIGHPTY Project be
amended to include Louistd. MACXINO, a Contract Agent, wko is a Station support
asset. Her OA was reinstated on 4 August 1958 (C-41:52). She was fornerly included
under Project LIMSAT.. Howaver, the Station requiremrts for general translation
work increased to the extent that it was necessary to usa MACAI:0 to translate reports
other than those originating from LIFSAT. It was therefore decided it would be more
appropriate to include her under LIZMPTY. She does «xyping of reports and nan-sensitivo
translations. She is psid on an hourly basis of $2.03, an estimated yearly salary of
$3,500. The Station stated that the present LISNey Project could atsord the expanse
of her Salary | for the remainder of the Project Years aes

SUBJECT 2 Project LIEMPTY (approval)

WH = Mexico City

moa
1

1. The attached project, originating in WH Division, is presented ©

‘for your approval for an initial period from 1 December 1958 through

30 November 1959. The project provides for the development of operational
information through physical and photographic surveillance operations in
support of other Mexico City operations, particularly those targetted at —~
Sovtet personnel and installations. Previously theags operations were con=

- ducted for the most part under Projects LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY, They are

incorporated in this new project because of the June 1958 compromise of
LIPSTICK and to accomplish a more orderly administration of certain opera-

tional support assets.

2. Authority is requested to obligate $95,380 from the DD/P-WH
Division operating budget: - $65,580 for the current fiscal year and
$29,900 in fiscal year 1960, subject to the availability of funds. These
estimates include: (a) funda for the compensation of the presently-

" pecruited fifteen action and support agente 1» six new agents, and two

principal agents: Raymond H. GERENDE (p) (LIZMPTY/1, formerly LIPSTICK/20)
and Oliver G, SCANTLING (p) (LIEMPTY/2, formerly LIPSTICK/19)3 (b) funds

for the compensation, travel, allowances and Headquarters’ training of two
contract agente, Simon D. CLACKETT (p) and Wilma J. FIORDALISI (p), his wife,
who are hereby transfarred: from Project LIMESA; (ce) funds for operational
expenses and equipment, including the purchase of four new or used vehicles
as replacements for previously authorised vehicles and their maintenance,
and a <P vehicle for SCANTLING; (d) the rent, utilities and maintenance of
safehouses; and, (e) other appropriate operational expenses.

t

3. The attached Neld Project Outline, a covering memorandum from the
Division, and en addendum to the Project Outline, review the personnel assets
and facilities transferred from the LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY operations following
the partial compromiss of LIPSTICK in June 1958 and describe the concept of
the physical and photographic surveillance operations to be conducted under
thia project directed primarily at the Soviet Nubassy in Mexico City. These
surveillances provide photographs and other operational data of persona entering
and leaving the building or present in the garden area, and through additional ~
foot and mobile surveillances, investigative information concerning their
contacts and destinations, Agent personnel, particularly the principal egenta,
are used algo to conduct separate investigations, make recruit-approaches to

individuals of operational interest, and to rent rooms, and apartments and
perform other support activities, The fixed surveillance bases, LIMITED,
LILYRIC and LICALLA, have’ been.in operation for almost three yeara without -
having been in any coupromising situations insofar as the Station knows,
The.LIPSTICK unit, a panel tick equipped vith camerss, otc., is considered
a partioularly valuable asset by the Field. ds a replacement for a staff
agent, Wilfred 0. CLOWSR (p), who directed and trained the LIPSTICK surveil-
lance team, the husband and wife team of CLACKSTT and SIORDALISI are proposed
“as qualified individuals to recruit, train, and direct the new LIMMPTY our-
“veillance team and maintain its records. Appropriate notional cover was
arranged for them while in their previous project, LISSA, aa they reside in
Mexico. under trua nazes. One of the principal agents, GERENDE, will have no
contact with the new. surveillance team, but will be used to conduct special
investigations, counter-survoillances, and for other aupport uctivities.

4. The CI Staff commenta that LIEMPTY provides several types of physical
surveillance, all of vhich provide information of CI interest, and ss a support
) mechanism, a a production review 49 not appropriate cr necessary. The CI Staff
states further, that vith the compromise of the LIPSTICK surveillance team
the Mexico City Station lost ita only reliable ani efficient surveillance team,
LIEMPTY representing the Station's effort to replace that asset. Pecause of
the great number of GI targets in Mexico City, the CI Staff believes it is
essential that the Station be given the opportunity, through this project, to
build another surveillance team capable of operating against sensitive targets.
Additionally, the CI Staff believes the case officer should work at devising
ostensible sources of incomes for the agents which will stand the scrutiny of

friends, relatives and lesa friendly forces.

5. FI/OPS suggests that the Division consider a gradual reduction of the
considerable financial and personnel comnitments in this project in view of
the favorably developing LIENVCY liaison relationship. FI/CPS believes that
a smaller, more manageable support group, with greater Station emphasia on
selectivity of tasks and targets could well result in more effective CI and

FI productivity.

Request for Anendrent to LIEMMTY Project

1. It ts requested that the LIEMPTY Project approval request be
amended to include Simbn D. CLACKETT (ps) and Wilma J. FIOKCALISI (ps),
U. S. eitizens and contract agents, under this Project in place of the
Staff Agent written into the field project outline. At the same time it is
requested that the LIFHCA Froject be amended to delete these contract
agents from the latter project.

2. CLACKETT and FIORUALISI are. now approved under the LIMESA Project..
They were recruited in the United States to occupy a sensitive LIMPSA base
house, because of the sensitivity of the operation and the equipment to be
installed in the basehouse Headquarters decided U. S. citizens should be
used. The Station said appropriate documentation and backstooping could
be sacured for those agents so they could be given false identities under

‘which they could live while they occupied the bazehouse,

3. FEXI-2777 (1N 26519), of 14 November 1958, notified Headquarters
that security factors and difficulty in obtaining adequate documentation
and backetopping precluded tie use of U. S. citizens under LIMASA and re-
quested permission to use indigenous agents for this operation. After dis-
cussions between John BiinDs, Chief of the Mexican desk, with the LIMESA/
LIEMPTY Case Officer in Mexico City, and discussions between representa-
tives of F1/D, OC, TSS, and WH at Headquarters, Headquarters concurred in
the field’s operational decision to use indigenous agents in the LIMESA
Project. CLACsETT and FIGEDALISI received only a very superficial briefing
regarding the LIMESA Project. It is not believed Subject's limited know-
ledge of this sensitive operation will pose a security hazard,

4, Construction on the LIMUST houses is being kept about two weeks
from completion until indigenous agents can be cleared and recruited. The
delay in completion is normal heesuse all construction money in Mexico has
become extremely tight because of tne recent presidential inauguration.

5 The Station believes CLACAETT will be an excellent replacement for
Wilfred O. CLO.ER (ps), former Staff Agent under Project LIPSTICK, who
directed and trained thet surveillance team, CiaChHi? has shown a remarkable
aptitude for clandestine operational activity and survet)lance and investi-
gative work in particular. He also is interested and enthusiastic in under-
taking this assignment for KUE.FK. The Station needs a good bilingual agent
to recruit, train, direct, and develop a strong dependable physical. surveil-
lance team under LIEMTY,

6. Clearances and Contacts: CLAChETT was granted a PCSA on 23 July 1958.
A PoA/OA for use under LIMESA was requested on 19 August 1958. FICKDALISI
was grarted an OA for use under LIMESA on 14 November 1958, Requests have
been submitted to amend their clearances for use under LIEMPTY, CLACKEIT
and FIORLALISI have signed contracts effective 1 September 1958. The
sensitivity of the LIltSs Project required them to leave their young son in

the United Stutes.’ Bacause of this a special benefit of periodic trips to
their home in Arizona was included in their contrects. Under LINESA tHeir
quarters were to be provided. An azendment has been requested to their ~~
contracts deleting the special benefit and adding educational and quarters

allowances,

?. Motivation and Control: CLACKETT and FIORDALISI are extremely.
patriotic and highly motivated as evidenced in their willingness to under-

take the LIMESA Project and be separated from their son. They have indt-

cated they are more than willing to do whatever is requested of them, no
matter. what. personal sacrifices and hardships are required. Their com-

plete livlihood is dependent on their KUBARK income.

8. Tasks: CLACKETT will’ recruit, train, and direct the LIEMPTY
surveillance team. The Station hopes to develop this team into a major
Station support asset. He will receive instructions and direction from the
Station Case Officer. FICRDALISI will be used to do all the clerical and
administrative work for the LiENPTY surveillance team,

9. Comamnication and Cont:ets CLACKETT will contact the Station Case

Officer in a clandestine manner, <All necessary security precautions will be
taken, CLACKE[T will also contact his surveillance agents uncer a cover

which will be determined later by the Station and CLACKETT. In view of his

Mexican background, CLAChETT can pass as a Mexican. Details of communication
and contact arrangements with KGSASK will be arranged by the Station. Under
LIENPTY CLACKETT will be contacted by the same Case Officer he is now con-
tacted by under LIMESA. CLACKETT and FIORDALISI will be in direct contact
with relatives and friends in the lnited States. The cover company has,
until now, been serving as a letter drop and contact point for emergency

messages.
10, Cover: CLACKETT and FIOROALISI entered Mexico on United States

documentation and it is planned they will continue to live in Mexico under |
true name. CLAChETE has a notional cover as a public relations consultant
which was established by CCD/NC to use with friends and relatives in the U. S,
The same cover story can be adopted to cover their proposed use under L3"sPIY
vis-a-vis their United States friends. The Station is working on local cover

for CLAChETT to use in Mexico.

1. The KDFACTOR Project, which provided photographic

survet1lance from two vantage potats of the Sovict compound .

in Mexico City, was determined to be compromised due to the

VWBLANKET case. The five agents were terminated fin July

1972, _ but the base houses could not be terminated untt?

January 1973 because {t was necessary to sell one and the
termination of the second was tied to the termination of
KDABBEY who owned the second base house. It was necessary
to pay rent for several extra months unt#] these other
terminations could be effected.

2. The base houses and agents have now all been ter-
minated and the Station already has rented a replacement.

" MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans
SUBJECT: Security Review of Project KDFACTOR

1. At the time you approved the renewal of Project

- KDFACTOR in December 1971 you asked that the Station

conduct an updated security review of this operation,

which provides photographic surveillance of the Soviet

Embassy in Mexico City. You asked that particular atten-

tion be paid to terminated agents and their families.

The Station has made a security review and a detailed

report on the findings, from Chief, WH Division, is

attached,

2. The repert discusses the history of the opera-
tion, describes security problems of the past and steps
taken to remedy them, and discusses the security and
operational situation of the agents presently covered
by the project. The report notes that the two opera-
tional sites and their associated agents are compart- —
mented from each other and that processing the film is
now being done inside the Station. One section of the
report discusses in detail the assets who were formerly
involved in these operations but have been terminated.
The final section of the report describes current secu-
rity-practices and notes that an alternate photographic
surveillance site has been procured and is available
for use should the present one be compromised.

3. The report demonstrates that the security of
the operation is being kept up to high standards and
that there are no potential security threats from
former agents that the Station is not aware of. The
FI Staff believes that the Station's security review
and the attached report satisfy the requirements of

your request.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Deputy Darector for Plans
THROUGH : MPS/8G/PL

SUBJECT : Project KOFACTOR - Security Review

1. The CI Staff is satisfied with the fine
Security Review of the KDFACTOR Project activity
and personnel.

2. However, the Staff urges the Station to
remain constantly alert to any security repercussions
pertaining to all the terminated assets particularly
in view of their past knowledge of the project
activity and the fact that some of them had family

vand relatives who also were aware of the project

activity. Focus should continue regarding any
security problems pertaining to KDFACTOR-7.

3. %In addition, the Station should continue
to monmxtor any Soviet investigation or probing of
owners and tenants involved in the properties used
under this project.

SUBJECT ' : FI Project KDFACTOR, Security Review
REFERENCE : ADDP Memo (DD/P 1-5899) to C/WHD dated

14 December 1971

1, In response to reference the following is a summary of the

KDFACTOR security review:

The Station summary of the KDFACTOR Project security is
as follows:

‘There were no known problems of security relating to
the Project. In response to the Headquarters request, we have
reviewed all phases of the operation and believe that Project
security is sound. The Project assets have all been with us for
many years and have established themselves as respectable long-
time residents of the area, All five assets, four in one family
and one in another, are extremely security conscious and have
all been SGSWIRLED.' The assets derive a substantial portion
of their livelihood from their Agency employment and would thus

“lose a great deal if security factors ever necessitated a termina-

tion of their work for us,, AS an additional safeguard, the
KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from eachother, 2nd there has never been any indication that
either segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence",

The Headquarters desk has also reviewed the security of the
KDFACTOR Project and agrees with the Station that the security
is sound. In fact, as presently constituted, the KDFACTOR
Project is well compartmented, and each of the two KDFACTOR
photo basehouses (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) is run by long-
term assets who draw a minimum of suspicion in their operational
activities, Terminated assets could possibly expese the existence

of this project, but that seems unlikely from the Headquarters

. review of terminated agents witting of present KDFACTOR
operational activities. A Soviet investigation of property owner-
ship around the Soviet Embassy and their awareness that the
Soviet Embassy was under photographic surveillance in the past
could resuit in a Soviet investigation of the activities and contacts
of KDABBEY:1, the owner of an apartment building and four
houses close to the Soviet Embassy, It is doubtful that KDABBEY-!'s
activities, which do not inter-relate with the activities of the
KDFACTOR agents, would in any way expose the KDFACTOR
Project operational activities,

2, A brief history of the KDFACTOR Project:

The KDFACTOR Project had its origins in the LUEERSEY
and LIPSTICK Projects, both active in the mid-1950's, In 1958, after
the arrest of two LIPSTICK surveillance team members, it was decided
to break off the more sensitive, uncompromised LIPSTICK assets manning
and supporting two basehouses for photo surveillance of the Sovict Embassy,
These asséts wei consolidated with one photo basehouse against the Soviet

. Embassy and one ‘surveillance team from the LISERSEY Project into a new

project-(LIEMPTY), which was approved on 16 January 1959. The LIEMPTY.
Project, renamed the KDFACTOR Project in 1971, consisted of three photo

“basehouses, two viewing-the front of the Soviet Embassy (LIMITED and

LILYRIC) and one viewing the rear garden of the Soviet Embassy (LICALLA),
plus a mobile surveillance team (LIENTRAP) tied closely with the LIMITED

‘basehouse, which was the radio control point for dispatch of the LIENTRAP.

- - In 1959 the LIENTRAP surveillance vehicle and two team
members were arrested at the scene of a Cuban demonstration in Mexico
City. A Station review of the security implications of this incident stated
that it did not materially affect the’ security of the project nor expose any
of the LIEMPTY basehouse operations. (Note: As the basehouse operations
were compartmented, the only exposure possible from this incident would
have been of the LIMITED basehouse, which is no longer in existence, }

The LIEMPTY Project operated substantially as above until 7
the Warren Commission report was published in late 1964, In this publica-
tion was a picture of a person entering the Soviet Embassy taken from the
LIMITED basehouse. The LIMITED photo basehouse was closed in Sept-
ember 1964, and all photographic surveillance was suspended as a security
precaution, In January 1965 the LIMITED basehouse was relocated, and

\ <3.

later that year the building it had previously been in was razed by the v

owner, KDABBEY-1, From 1964 on it must be assumed that the Soviet

. Embassy in Mexico City believes it is under regular photographic sur-

y

- velllance. ‘

' Further project changes took place in 1966 when the LILYRIC
basehouse was relocated to another apartment with approximately the
same view; In May 1968 the LIMITED basehouse was terminated and
LIEMPTY-6, -the basehouse keeper, retired. This affected the LIENTRAP

_= ‘overage of Soviet véhicular movement monitored and directed from the
- LIMITED basehouse. With the.closing of LIMITED and the Station decision

to replace Raymond H. GERENDE, Mexican national contract agent who
handled the LIEMPTY Project since its inception, the LIENTRAP mobile
surveillance teani was underemployed, and the decision was made to move
it to the LIEMBRACE Project. This was done in early 1970, soon after
GERENDE had been relieved of operational responsibilities in December

1969,

The photo processing of the KDFACTOR (formerly LIEMPTY) ~
film take is now being done by the Station, In the past, it was done by
the Station, by GERENDE, and by KDFACTOR-I, who was terminated
amicably in early 1971, The building housing the KDLITERAL (formerly
LICALLA) photo basehouse was purchased in 1957 by KDABBEY-! for

the Station. KDLITERAL is in a row of four houses all owned ostensibly

by KDABBEY-! but actually by the Agency. This row also houses a base-
house for FID's KDVAULT Project. The apartment building housing the
KDABSINTHE (formerly LILYRIC) photo basehouse is owned outright by
KDABBEY-1, who has been most cooperative in assisting the Station in

‘maintaining and occasionally moving (1965 and 1966) photo basehouses,

Th¢ LIMITED photo basehouse was qlso located on KDABBEY-I's property
when it was active. ,

The individual basehouse operations are and have always been
compartmented one from the other. The only points of breakdown in the
compartmentation have been: (a) the LIMITED basehouse was linked to
the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance; (b) KDFACTOR-1 was processing
films from all the basehouses and could, therefore, be aware of their
exact locations; (c) GERENDE was aware of all aspects of the KDFACTOR
operation, and has since been terminated; (d) Oliver G, SCANTLING,
Station contract agent retired in 1971, was aware of the KDFACTOR Project

through his past work with LIEMPTY-6 and with GERENDE on KDFACTOR
Project activities; and (e) the fact that the two present basehouse properties
are owned by KDABBEY-1, who ts witting of the locations and general

activity of both KDFACTOR basehouses, ,

Regarding the security of the above active KDFACTOR agents,

- the- KDLITE RAL basehouse is handled by KDFACTOR-2 with the assistance

of his wife, KDFACTOR-10. They have a long-time maid and a 13-year-

old son who lives with them in the basehouse, Neither the son nor the maid
is believed to be witting. The photographic equipment is kept in a locked
room, and the product is kept in a locked safe, KDFACTOR-2 was recruited
by KDCALVERT-1, who is an active, long-term Station agent in the
KDCALVERT Project and who is not considered a threat to KDFACTOR-2's |
security. KDFACTOR-2's activities are also known to his brother, the
former LIPSTICK-47, who was one of the two LIPSTICK surveillance team
members arrested in 1958 and who gave the police considerable information
regarding LIPSTICK surveillance activities, LIPSTICK-47 was terminated
in late 1958 and is believed to have withheld from the police the information
regarding KDFACTOR-2 and the KDLITERAL basehouse. KDFACTOR-2
and his family have occupied the KDLITERAL basehouse since 1957 and

have been discreet and security conscious in their dealings with neighbors
and relatives,

wife KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons KDFACTOR-8 and KDFACTOR-9, .
The. SGSWIRL of 2 March 1966 went into detail on who is witting of
KDFACTOR-5's work for the Station, The result was that his immediate
family, including a married daughter who no longer lives at the basehouse,
are aware of the photographic operation, KDFACTOR-5 was recruited by’
LIEMPTY-I2, a U., S. citizen with a private company in Mexico City who.
is no longer working with the Station but who is considered patriotic and
no threat to KODFACTOR security.

4, Terminated Agents Possibly Affecting Present Project Security:
A. Raymond H, GERENDE

GERENDE isa Mexican citizen and was a contract agent
until his termination on 26 June 1970, He had been employed by the Station

intermittently since 1955 and was used almost exclusively in support activities,

Since the start of the LIEMPTY Project in 1958 GERENDE had been directly
involved with this project serving as cutout to the basehouses, carrying and
processing films, .and giving general direction to the project as principal
agent, In'1969, after years of-excellent service with the Station, GERENDE
had serious marital problems which ended in separation from his wife,
KDFACTOR-7. From December 1969 to June 1970 GERENDE was not used
operationally but was ‘maintained on half pay with the hope the divorce pro-

" ceedings would be completed quickly, When it became apparent the divorce

would drag on interminably, the Station reluctantly terminated GERENDE
and his wife. Bruce H, FERNALD, career agent, met with GERENDE
monthly from July 1970 through May 1971 while paying him his termination
bonus in ten installments, GERENDE is still living in Mexico City, where

. he owns some property and has an income as an English teacher to employees

of two local firms, He visited his wife and children in Holland in December
1970, It appears he may now be financially pressed as his English class

_. schedule has been cut back, The Station as of 10 April 1972 had no informa-

tion that would indicate GERENDE has violated hig secrecy agreement,

There is an indication that GERENDE came to the attention
of the Soviets in 1968; A Mexican walk-in to the FBI office in Mexico City,
who was later interrogated by the Federal Security Police in 1970, said
that in 1968 he had been employed by the Soviet Embassy Second Secretary,
Oleg Masksimovich Nechiporenko (201-305870), to investigate persons
working with the Mexican Olympic Committee, The persons investigated

SECRET

SECRET =n,

=)

included GERENDE, who apparently became a specific target of Soviet
investigation, It is "unclear. from the report of the Federal Security Police
how far the Soviet. -lnvestigation of GERENDE had proceeded, Nechiporenko

n ‘was _PNG'd from Mexico in March 1971, GERENDE's possible exposure to

the Soviets could have been through his work on the Olympic Committee as
a translator or through his work for the Station, which used him for a wide
range. of Support tasks against the Soviet and Cuban targets,

. B KDFACTOR-7 (wife of GERENDE)

de . KDFACTOR-? is a Dutch citizen and the former wife of

GERENDE. She returned to the Netherlands in July 1970 with her children,
She had served as a support agent assisting GERENDE, She is believed
witting, in general terms, of GERENDE’s activities regarding the KDFACTOR
Project. She was -terminated on 26 June 1970 and signed both a secrecy
agreement and quit claim. After termination it became apparent that she

had considerable hard feelings toward both the Agency and GERENDE over
financial:problems between her family and GERENDE, While the Station

was not directly involved in all the financial problems, the Station was

involved in regard to her divorce claims against GERENDE's salary, a

large part of which came covertly from the Station, In July 1970 KDFACTOR-7
came to the Agency Headquarters-and complained about her financial settle-
ment, In September and November.1970 she wrote two letters directly to

the Agency on the same subject. In late 1970 she also asked a Hague Embassy
political officer to put her in contact with the Agency; however, she did not
tell him the nature of her business, In January 197i the Agency contacted
KDFACTOR-7's brother, a U. S; Army civilian-with a "Top Secret" clearance
living in Alexandria, Virginia, and was able to resolve the financial mis-
understandings with KDFACTOR-7. In January 1971 the Hague Station
reported KDFACTOR had, without Station influence, obtained a job as social
secretary with the Department of State-at the Embassy. It is believed that
this job has probably solved many of her financial problems and should also
inhibit her from exposing her past work with the Mexico City Station, as

such exposure could jeopardize her job, The Embassy in the Hague was
briefed in general terms on KDFACTOR-7's background,

C. KDFACTOR-!

KDFACTOR-1 is a Mexican citizen and the brother-in-law
of GERENDE, He was hired by the Station in 1956 to assist GERENDE in
processing the photographic take of the KDFACTOR Project (at that time
the LIPSTICK Project and later the LIEMPTY Project), KDFACTOR-1

14-0000

eee was later assisted in processing the photographic take by his wife,
so LIEMPTY-5, who is GERENDE's sister. KDFACTOR-1 was terminated
in March 1971, arid the photegraphic processing previously done by
KDFACTOR-I is-now doné'in the Station, The termination was amicable
_ and largely due to delays in film processing as KDFACTOR-I's medical
practice expanded, © There does not appear to be any security problem
in the termination of KDFACTOR-1 as he is discreet and also a close
relative of GERENDE, The security of processing the film in KDFACTOR-I's
‘medical office was good as KDFACTOR-I's wife, LIEMPTY-5, was assist-
‘ing him with the processing and with the security of the darkroom,

D, LIEMPTY-5

LIEMPTY-5 was hiréd by the Station in 1957 to assist
KDFACTOR-1 with the processing of KDFACTOR films, She is the sister
of GERENDE and wife of KDFACTOR-1. She was terminated along with
KDFACTOR-I in March 1971, Due to her close relationship with GERENDE
and KDFACTOR-1, she is not considered a ihreat to the Project Security.

E, Oliver G. SCANTLING

‘ . SCANTLING is a Mexican citizen who worked as a Station

' agent from 1954 until his termination without prejudice in February 1971,

‘ SCANTLING is in an excellent financial position and has assisted the

‘ Station in recent-years largely because his strong motivation to work

to against the Communists, SCANTLING worked as a surveillance team

i leader from 1954 to 1957 and then in the LIEMPTY (KDFACTOR) Project

from 1958 through 1966, He was the cut-out to LIEMPTY-6 and a back-up
So principal agent for GERENDE, SCANTLING's termination was amicable,

, and he is not considered a security problem to the Station or the KDFACTOR

Project,
_F. LIEMPTY-6

a LIEMPTY-6, a Mexican citizen and long-term Station - ‘
: asset, was retired.in May 1968, He had manned the LIMITED photo base-

house with his wife and son assisting him, He had been working with the

: Station since 1954, but age and ill health had reduced his efficiency,

i |" LIEMPTY-6 knows GERENDE and SCANTLING, but is not aware of the

names or locations of any of the present KDFACTOR agents and basehouses,

While he could give information on his participation in KDFACTOR activities

up to 1968, he has no motive to do this and is apparently happily retired on

his ‘Agency termination bonus plus some financial assistance from his son-

in-law, He is not considered a threat ta the security of this Project.

SECRET

o SECRET es

: There was one indication that the Soviets were seeking

>» out the- LIMITED photo basehouse and may have had suspicions. concerning
LIEMPTY-6, This was a report by KDADAGE-10 that in mid-1966 Stanislav
Sergeyevich Silnikov (201-271103), a Sovict Embassy guard, asked KDADAGE-
10 to report on his neighbors near the Soviet Embassy. Silnikov expressed
interest-in all the occupants of the new apartment building which houses the
KDABSINTHE photo basehouse,. but did not mention the KDABSINTHE base-
house keepers by: name. _Siinikov did name specific persons he was inter-
ested in and these included LIEMPTY-6, KDADAGE-10, of unknown °
reliability, said he did not give Silnikov any information, ‘but added that,
between himself and the Station, he suspected LIEMPTY-6 and had heard

it rumored he worked for the Americans, In 1966 Headquarters already
assumed the Soviets were aware of the LIMITED basehouse because it was
used for radio direction of the LIENTRAP mobile surveillance. In any case,
_the Soviets apparently took no action prior to the closing of the LIMITED
basehouse and the relocation of LIEMPTY-6 in May 1968, It is believed

this incident has no implications that would threaten the security of current

NDFACTOR assets,
5.. Current KDFACTOR Security Practices:

The two photo basehouses, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE
remain compartmented, as they-have been throughout the history of the
Project, The Station case officer responsible for the project meets weekly
with KDFACTOR-2, responsible for the KDLITERAL basehouse, and with
KDFACTOR-5, responsible for the KDABSINTHE baschouse, In these
meetings he picks up the product, provides new supplies, pays salaries
and handles miscellaneous administrative matters, These are car meetings
usually held in early morning or at night and the pickup points are changed
regularly. Meeting time is kept toa minimum and meetings are pre-

. Scheduled whenever possible, The photographic product is processed in
the Station, thus increasing the security and timeliness of its handling
over the past practice of having KDFACTOR-1 process it in his office
darkroom, The case officer only meets with KDFACTOR-2 and KDFACTOR-5;
however, in‘emergencies other witting family members of either basehouse
can be contacted and met. In case the present sites or personnel are com-
promised, the Station has rented another apartment in the building housing
the KDABSINTHE basehouse and has installed members of the KDCALVERT
Project as residents, This new apartment offers as good a vantage point

‘QUEST FOR RYNEWAL

CURRENT CBJECTIVES

A, The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its eleventh
year of existence, is to collect operational information on the
FISTLEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as
related targets ©. opportunity throuch stat tonary/mobile photo~

objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LISMPTY
installations, mechantsns, and personnel are as follows;

1, To provide detailed operational informat ton pertaining
to the daily movements and activities of bss Aneel,
particularly those incdivideats of intelligence interesi,

CHANGES

Dering, the Trosect year Project LIEMPTY provided at) of the
tixed operational photographs and physieal surveillance reperts
used in Mexica City Station's operations targetted asainst the
PUISTEAL installation and personnel, Specssic examples o1 the
LIENPTY Froject's pregress and contributions willbe lound in

Section 3 below (EFFECTIVENESS)

A, Cperational :

1. The mat {on change during the preceeding period has been
the closing of the LIMITED basehouse and the termination of
LIEMPTY.}", 0 This has resulted in considerable financial
saving with no loss in etlicieney--to the contrary, as 2a
matter of fact. The major reason fer the change was the
fact that LTEMPPyso was frowtny Tess reliable with age. He
was not alw nble to be on the job, and when he was, his
fixed surveillance reporting was occasionally inaccurate,
and bis photerraphy was often poor, There had been
considerable overlap between LILYREIC and LIMITLD report iag,
and with the closing of LIMNIT#D, the LILYRIC working hours
were extended slightly so that full working hours of the
FJSTEAL installation continued to be covered, ‘fhe only
disadvantage ¢o this arrangement is that the vantare point
ol the FISTEAL installation which had been shared by
LIMITLD and LILYRIC will now xo uncovered during periods of
annual leave by LILYRIC personnel (the LILYRIC personnel
are all members of one family and nomially take their

leave together),

2. in the operating procedures
and techniques of LTSMPTY-9 in the LICALLA baschouse, The
refinements described in the previous Project Cutline have
been etfective and have been maintained, The same can be
said of LYENTRAP, which has become a much more flexible
tool Since its partial intepration inte the LIEMBRACE team,
There have been no changes in LILYRIC procedures, other
than expansion of coverage to include the entire working

week,

2 There have been no changes

R, Financial - LIEMPTY-9 was granted a salary increase, etfective
1 May “TOCK, In recognition of his excellent job performance,
LUUMPTY-14 and -27 were granted sulary increases on 1 May 168,
largely as compensation ror the extra hours they agreed to put

in to ‘insure fultetime coverage of the FISTEAL installation by
LILYRIC, Memoranda of Oral Agreenent covering these three salary
increases were forwarded with HMWA-34573, 2 May 1968, Finally,
LIEYPETY-11 was sranted a salary increase ectrective 1 January

19°", in recopaitioun of his increased work load with the LI RACH
team, MCA was iorwarded with HMMA-5 j101, 25 Docember Lys,

14-0000

C. Personnel

1. As noted above, LIEMPTY=5 was terminated effective
31 May 1968 in connection with the closing of the LIMITED

bagehouse, Termination was completely amicable, and
LIEMPTY- > received a generous termination bonus.

2. LISMPTY-26 was hired as of 1 May 19.8 to help LILYRIC
personnel maintain their expanded coverage. No security
factor is involved, as LI¥MPTY<23 is part of the same family
as the rest of the LILYRIC personnel. LIEMPTY=2.i had been
granted an OA in 1$c5 ahd had been used sporadtcally since

that time,

4 : Be “An amendaent to GERENDE's contract has been requested,
This amendment would pvarantce GERENDE termalnation benerits
equal to these provided tor by Mexican law, in the event of

' . GiPiNDE'S termination by WOFIRM. The amendment would also
provide GERENDE with a graduated seale ci beneiits should

he decrde to resign, See HMMAeSISL2, 27 January 190%, tor
details,

Be
i Throughout the period umier review, each operational component
, of Project LYENPTY contributed actively and coneretely to the
: Anliilinent ot the operational tasks levied oa Station Mexico
City. High-lights oj the acconplishments and the achievenents
01 each component are cited below:
‘ A. Fixed Rasehouses

a. LIMITED

bts termination, the LINTT=D installation provided daily
phetographic coverace and physieal surveillance of the main
gate of the FJS'1 L installation, During the seven-month
period from 1 November 1947 through 31 May 196%, the LIMITED
base provided 911 franes of operational photozraphs, In
additicn, the LIMITED base provaded over 1,000 pares ot
physical surveillance reports,

During the Project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
provided extensive photographie and. fixed visual surveillance
of the front of the FJSTLCAL installation. The LILYRIC base-
house provided the majority of the operational photographs
produced by the LIEMPTY Project, During the IS-month period
fron 1 November 1967 through 31 December 1968, the LILYRIC
basehouse provided 15,331 operational photographs and several

14-00000

thousand pares ef physical surveillance reports covering the ee
daily movements of all FUISTHAL officers, As a specific
exanple of the impertance of LILYRIC coverage, it was LILYRIC
photes which made possible the identification of a WCLADY
citizea who had been in clandestine contact with an AEGRIP
ofticer, This ‘information was turned over to LNERGO, which
was pursuing the case, In general, LILYRIC provides the
Station with a Jarse percentage of the CI raw material
collected on the FISTEAL tarcet, such as automobile license
hnurbers, PCS and TDY arrivals -andtdepartures, unusual
activities such as demonstrations, unusual or lengthy
absences of personnel, etc. This tnformation also has
positive operational value, but its most important use is as
1 - the major source of identification of FISTHAL personnel and
ef infarmation on their movements, The Station has frequent
requests from LNURGO which can only Le fulfilled by LISMPTY
cove e, and this "permanent and eorplete record” of FISTEAL
activities is invaluable for servicing the CE requirements

of both NOFTRM and LYERGO,

3.0 LICALLA wee

the above cited MWementh period, the LICALLA installation
provided photograchie and physicaL surveillance coverare of
the vack of the FASTLAL installation and its garden and
patio area, This coverage provided 5,120 individual photographs
as well as numberous surveillance and observation reports,

AS outlined above, each individual ererational cempenent of the
LIEVPTY Profect, with the cxeeplion cy the phasedeout LIMITED
basehouse, contribu egularly and sipnifieantty to the iulfille
ment of Station Mexi y's operati l vrogram, Sased on the
continued excellent performance oJ Frojeet personnel and the
overall contributions ov this Project, the Station strongly
recommends that this Pro;ect be continved during the forthcoming
Project year as an essential element of the Statton's operational

support apparatus,

PROBLEMS AND SECURITY

During the Project year under review there were no known incidents
which adversely aifected the security ef Projeet LInwry or the
related personnet, The termination of LINMPTY-.) caused no problems,
nor did the construction of a maid's room on the root of the LICALLA
installotion, adjacent to LIEMPTY-9's pueto point, There is no
indication that FJSTEAL personnel had any suspicions about the
construction work. ‘fhe e sure of a LIEMBRS surveillance

vehicle (see NXTICO CITY 28 Fehruary 199) caused momentary
conctrn because the vehicle had been beusht from a dealer where
LIEMPTY-9 has a part-time job, Along with all other employees

ot the auto dealer, L TY-9 was questioned about the purchaser

of the car, While LIEMPTY-9 was worried because he knew the
purchaser of the car and was able to guess what had happened,

the investigation was dropved and the case closed without any
adverse effect on LIEMPTY-y or the LICALLS basehouse.

A. The changes made in the period under review have been largely

non-LIkiMTy-ortented operational activity by G there are
no significant operational chanses centenplated. PTY is

is useful only as long as it supperts that program eilectively,
The Station believes that the suppert has been eftective, and
that: the product of the operation is valuable, Occasional miner

to the end of a fiscal year, This sum is identical to that
requested for a similar period in 1968 as there is no
present justification for projecting any change in the
financial requirements, The supplement would bring the
cost of LIEMPTY to a total of $69,725 for 19 months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans
“SUBJECT : LIEMPTY Project Renewal

1. Renewal of Project LIEMPFY for the period’ 1 Decem-
ber 1967 through 30 November 1968 in the amount of $43,520
is hereby requested, $26,205 would be spent in FY 1968 and
$17,315 in FY:1969. Tle project was budgeted for $45,000 for
FY 1968; funds are available within the Division. Estimated
costs for the coming project year are a little less than the
amount programmed for the previous year and a little more
than what was actually disbursed, el
. 2. LIEMPTY is designed to provide physical surveil-
lance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. It covers three
nearby properties (two in front of the Embassy's sole entrance
and one behind the garden) from which visual and photographic
surveillance are carried. out by experienced personnel, The
project also covers a darkroom where a technician processes
the photographs. In addition to collecting this basic informa~
tion on a primary target, certain of the LIEMPTY personnel
are also available for miscellaneous support tasks, such as
servicing postal boxes, and running fixed and moving surveil-
lances. The photo truck which comes under the project is
used on other targets as well, such as CP members, satellite
embasSies, and Latin American exiles. One of the basehouses
is also used as a radio dispatch point for the LIEMBRACE sur-
veillance team, but this function has been minimized during
the past year in an effort to prevent Soviet interception of

the signal.
3. a. The Mexican desk asked the appropriate opera-

tional component of SB Division for specific comment on the
value of LIEMPTY, and received the following:

"This rather unique operation has
unquestionably made a major contribu-
tion to the increasingly effective
Soviet Operations program of the
Mexico Station. On the positive
side its principal value lies. in the
identification of the Mexican and

third national contacts of the Soviets,
i i from which we must select and develop
\ . . the access agents so vital to our oper-
‘ ' ations against the Soviet human target.
‘ LIEMPTY also provides us with a much
: ‘ ‘Clearer picture of the inner relation-
! : ships-and activity patterns within the
. ' Soviet mission itself, which in turn
facilitates effective targeting. The
H CE value of a LIEMPTY type project as
a monitor of real and potential agent
contacts is of course obvious. It is
i a important to note that LIEMPTY is not,
: as might be the case in stations of
| lesser overall capability, a simple
case of photography (or observation)
. for the record, Rather it is an import-
bo ant facet of a concerted high priority
: effort to -get at and recruit individual
Soviets,"

b. Station reporting has been in a similar vein,
Information produced is largely for operational purposes and
we often lack detail as to specific utility in a given situ-
ation, although we can produce statistics on numbers of photo-
graphs produced and numbers of pages of surveillance notes.

It is clear that the FBI is an interested customer and they
have received from LIEMPTY a great many reports on American
callers at the Soviet Embassy, and valuable support to double
agent operations. :

ec. During a conversation on 8 December 1967, the
officer who heads the station's SB section told the branch
that. LIENPTY is basic and essential to all of his branch's
operational planning, that he “grabs the LIEMPTY material
first thing in the morning" and studies it for leads, evidence
of which Soviet officers have been in the Embassy ana which
ones have been away, who has used which car, who has been talk-
ing to whom or going out of the building with whom, etc. etc.

GRU by their associates, their activity patterns and the cars
they drive. (The 1,8, men are often away from the Embassy,

‘New additions to the Embassy staff can be tabbed as KGB or [

: while the legitimate FSO's tend to spend more time in their

offices, The KGB, GRU and regular diplomatic groups seldom
cross lines but stay within their own tight groups.) When

“double agents are turned over from one case officer. to a new

one, known to them only in alias, we are often able, through
surveillance and photographs, to establish the true identity
of the new case officer, as was done in the case of AEGIMMICK

in the spring of 1967.

4. In assessing the security of the operation, the
station assumes that: the Soviets realize that they are being

. watched, as was.evidenced by a Soviet officer's trying to
v@hield-an FBI-directed walk-in from observation,

There have

been rumors that anyone entering the Soviet Embassy is photo-
graphed, but no allegations that the Americans are doing it
have come to our attention; the probable assumption is that
the Mexicans are doing this. A former source who lives in

the neixhborhood was asked on several occasions what he knew _
about LIEMPTY/6, one of the safchousekeepers, and the Soviets
have said they think he is watching them. On the security of
the LICALLA safehouse there is a difference of opinion,
GERENDE, the outside case officer, thinks the Soviets are
aware that they are being observed from this post, but station
disagrees and produces good justification for its views, cit-
ing the fact that the above-mentioned FBI walk-in was not
shielded when led into the back garden which LICALLA overlooks,
We have no evidence that Soviet interest is any threat to the
operation; rather it may be assumed that they accept the sur-

veillance as a fact of life.

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL +

CURRENT OBJECTIVES es ,
———err'

.

A. The overall objective of Project LIEMPTY, now in its tenth
year of existence, is to collect operational information on the
FJSTEAL installation, its personnel and visitors, as well as
related targets of opportunity through stationary/mobile photo=
graphic and physical surveillance mechanisms, Corollary
objectives which are to be fulfilled through use of the LIEMPTY
installations, mechanisms and; personnel are as follow:

1. To provide detailed operational information pertaining
to the daily movements and activities of the FJSTEAL
personnel, particularly those individuals of intelligence
interest, as well as information on the FJSTEAL physical

Plant and visitors to the premises.

2. To collect operatioual information on persons associated
with FJSTEAL persounel and on individuals known or suspected
to have connections with the FJSTEAL intelligence services
or other hostile groups which are inimical to the interests

of LNFORT.

3. To provide operational support, counter surveillance
and/or other protective services to WOFIRM personnel and
operations, as may be levied upon the Station or as may be

deemed necessary.

B. The above objectives dre to be fulfilled through continued
maintenance and exploitation of the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses, the LIENTRAP mobile unit, and the services of long-
time contract agent, Raymond H, GERENDE. These objectives are
in consonance with operational directives and Headquarters
requirements as received by Station Mexico City. ;

C. Throughout the Project year under review, Project LIEMPTY
continued to contribute directly and significantly to the fulfil-
lment of Station and Headquarters’ requests and requirements for
coverage of various targets falling within the above cited frame-
work. During the project year Project LIEMPTY provided nearly
all of the operational photographs and physical surveillance
reports used in Mexico City Station's operations targeted against
the FJSTEAL installdtion and personnel, Specific examples of the
LIEMPTY Project's progress and contributions will be found in
Section 3 below (EFFECTIVENESS).

CHANGES .

A. Operational - Since the institution of the changes described
in the previous renewal request, it has not been found neces-=
sary or desirable to make further mayor changes, The following
minor changes in operational technique have been made in an
effort to obtain continued improvement in the finished product:

1. LIEMPTY-9's proven effectiveness as an observer (see
Paragraph 3 A (3) below) has enabled us to institute a
system of special,coverage on specific FJSTEAL personnel
_of interest, or special coverage of specific time periods.

of interest, The purpose is to permit the Station to gain
greater insights into.the activities and personal associations
of certain individuals, or in overall activities during a
certain time period, No crange in LIEMPTY-9's overall

working hours has been made; rather, flexibility has been

introduced.

2. Flexibility has also been introduced into the handling

of LIENTRAP, which is now vorking more closely with the
LIEMBRACE team in order to-take greater advantage of targets
of opportunity. To this end, LIEMBRACE~1 has been placed

in direct contact with LIENTRAP, relieving Raymond H, GERENDE
of this responsibility and permitting GERENDE to devote time
to MHRAVEL activity (see sub-paragraph (3) below).

3. Ie September and October 1967 GERENDE was employed by

the Mexican MHRAVEL committee. This position gave him direct
access to FJSTEAL and other delegations of interest, and
“supplemented the Station's MHRAVEL program, It is expected
that GERENDE will obtain MHRAVEL employment. again in 1968,

B. Financial - LIE¥YPTY-4 and ~-1l were granted salary increases
effective 1 July 1967. Memoranda of ‘Oral Commitment were for-
warded to Headquarters in HMMA-32584 and HMMA-32585, 20 July
1967, There was no change in the salaries of the remaining

LIEMPTY agents,
C. Personnel ~ None.

EFFECTIVENESS

Throughout the period under review, each operational component
of Project LIEMPTY contributed actively and concretely to the

‘fulfillment of the operational tasks levied on Station Mexico

City, High~lights of the accomplishments and the achievements
of each compenent are cited below: °

SECRET

-A. Fixed Basehouses

1. LIMITED

H Throughout the past project year the LIMITED installations
provided daily photographic coverage and physical surveile

: lance of the main gate of the FJSTEAL installation. In

u addition, the LIMITED base provided for a fixed radio

: dispatching station which was used to support the LIEMBRACE

i ae * surveillance team. Due to the stringent security measures

: instituted in the immediate vicinity of the FJSTEAL instal-~
‘lation by local security forces, normal stake-outs by this
ufiilateral team are precluded. However, with the radio
dispatching support from the LIMITED radio base, which
allows the LIEMBRACE team to work from adjacent safe areas,
secure surveillance coverage of this target can be provided.
During the 12-month period from 1 November 1966 through
31 October 1967, the LIMITED base provided 1,834 frames of
operational photographs, lM addition, the LIMITED base
provided over 2,500 pages ot physical surveillance reports.

2. LILYRIC

eps . : During the project year under review, the LILYRIC installation
. \ provided extensive photographic and fixed visual surveillance
. of the front of the FJSTEAL installation, The LILYRIC base
‘ provided the majority of tre operational photographs produced
by the LIEMPTY project. During the 12-month period cited
in the LIMITED section above, the LILYRIC base provided
; 12,137 operational photographs and several thousand pages
: of physical surveillance reports covering the daily move-
: : ments of all FJSTEAL officers.

3. LICALLA

During the above cited 12-n0nth period, the LICALLA instal-~

lation provided photograph:¢ and physical surveillance

coverage of the back of the FJSTEAL installation and its

garden and patio area, Th:S coverage provided 4,917 indi-

. i vidual photographs as well. aS numerous surveillance and

because of the perceptivenesS of LIEMPTY-9, His surveil-
lance reports have frequeitly given us valuable insight

B. Summary of Fixed Basehouse Effectiveness

2 , The fixed LIEMPTY basehouses (LIMITED, LICALLA and LILYRIC)

i provided approximately 15,888 individual frames of oper-
ational photographs during the 12-month period of the past
project year; This photographic coverage, linked with the

; . . Physical surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse,
has proven to be a nost reliable and viable tool for;

3. Ascertaining and verifying the relative rank and
position as well as indicating the specific intelligence
service connection of various FJSTEAL officers,

4. Providing detailed reporting on the movement and
habit patterns of selected targets of special interest,

5. Providing physical facilities for the support of
various operational, technical and surveillance

operavions,
C. The Mobile Photographic Unit

1. . Throughout the period under review, the LIENTRAP mobile
photographic support unit was regularly exploited and used

by Station Mexico City, not only on the FJSTEAL target, but
also for PBRUMEN and Commurist Party operations as well as
the JMTIGER program. Over 2,000 operational photographs were
provided, In addition, the LIENTRAP personnel and unit

was used regularly to service and obtain various postal
accomodation boxes used by Mexico City, Headquarters and
other field stations,

D. Raymond H. GERENDE = LIEMPTY Principal Agent

During the period under review, with the exception of short
vacation periods, Raymond H. GERENDE, continued in his role
as the Project LIBMPTY principal agent. GERENDE operated

as the fulj-time cut-out to the LIEMPTY, LILYRIC and LICALLA
basehouses and bore the first echelon agent handling respon-
sibility for the related personnel, In addition, GERENDE

14-0000

continued to bear the contact and handling responsibilities
of the LIENTRAP unit (until mid-August 1967 - see paragraph
2 A (2) above) and for the operator of the LIEMPTY photo-
graphic deVeloping/processing laboratory, LIEMPTY-4.
GERENDE's overall operatioral assignment involved at least
12 clandestine meetings per week, in addition to his
meetings with the LIEMPTY Froject case officer. It should
“also be noted that GERENDE made numerous and essential
‘contributions to the sensitive AMROD operation and assisted
the Station greatly with his detailed area knowledge in
many “instances, .He is frequently used to make independent
investigations and neighborhood checks, As noted above,
he contributed significantly to the Station's MHRAVEL
program, Finally, he apprcached, developed and eventually
attempted to recruit an agent for use in PBRUMEN operations.

E. Overall Effectiveness

As outlined above, each incividual operational component

of the LIEMPTY Project contributed regularly and significantly
to the fulfillment of Station Mexico City’s operational
program. Based on the continued excellent performance and
overall contributions of this project, the Station strongly
recommends that this project be continued during the forth~
coming project year as an essential element of the Station's
operational support apparatus,

PROBLEMS AND SECURITY

During the project year under review there were no known inci-
dents which adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPTY

or the related personnel,

LIAISON AND INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION

Not applicable to Project LIEMPTY.

PLANS

A. As noted above, the technical and operational changes
made in the past year have been effective and have resulted
in a product which is as closely geared to operational
requirements as possible, While no major changes are
contemplated, every effort will be made to continue to
improve the product, including greater use of GERENDE as
an independent investigative asset, and as a spotter and
assessor of selected agent candidates, Such utilization
of GERENDE will be kept compartmented from other personnel
of the LIEMPTY project and will normally be handled by
GERENDE in operational alias,

B. The LIENTRAP vehiclo has been replaced, and no mafor
changes in personnel or raterial are contemplated. Salaries
of LIEMPTY-personnel will be reviewed, and it is foreseen that
the rising cost of living will compel us to recommend salary
increases for certain. of tle agents who have not received

raises in some time.

Aa ‘Past Project “Year = : Project LIEMPTY was previously approved
for the period 1 Decenber 1966 through 30 November 1967 for the
amount of 45,000 U.S. currency, Station records indicate that
through 32 October 1967, Project LIEMPTY has expended 37,040 in .
the field. It. is estimated that a total of 40,130 will be expended
-in the entire project year, Bi-weekly ‘account ings with pertinent
receipts and/or certifications were submitted by Raymond H, GERENDE
to the Station finance orficer via the project case officer for all_
LIEMPTY Project expenditures made in the field. It is estimated

that approximately 5 hours of case officer and 10 hours of analyst
time is required each week to fulfill the operational, administrative
and analytical requirements of this project. (This figure does not
include the 40 hour-week put in regularly by Raymond H, GERENDE).

B. During Project Year - It is requested that Project LIEMPTY be
approved in the amount of 43,520 U.S. currency for the period 1 a
December 1967 through 30 November 1968 (this figure represents a ~
slight decrease from the amount programmed for the previous project
year). While no Jarge expenditures are anticipated for the replace-
ment of photographic equipment during the forthcoming period, an
increase in the rental of the various basehouses may be encountered

as well as the above-cited expectation of salary increases, Of the
amount requested above, 26,205 dollars should be allowed for fiscal
year 1968 and 17,315 dollars for fiscal year 1969, A detailed break-
down of the project expenditure by category and by fiscal year follows:

EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

A. In the event of civil disorders or the evolution of complete

enforced neutrality on the part of the host government, it is

now believed that regular operational contact could be maintained

with the majority of the active LIEMPTY agents via Raymond H,

GERENDE or in his absence, Oliver G. SCANTLING.

B. In the most unlikely event of the establishment of a regime
openly hostile to LNFORT, limited contact could probably be
maintained with the majority of the active project agents,
However, under the circumstances described above, it is highly
probable that the activities of this project would be somewhat

curtailed,

The CI Staff concurs in the renewal of this very
valuable Project. The Staff strongly urges the Station to
continue its close monitoring of Soviet interest in the
installation buildings and attempts to obtain information on
sensitive project personalities. The Station should devise
necessary contingency plans of action to eliminate any

> securjty hazards if it is determined that the Soviets are
intensifying such efforts and could be getting “too close"to
the Project installations, personalities and activities.

: coverage provided from the new base by the LILYRIC operetors (cs00-1609

‘ hours) during the weekdays an] to have the LOMTED tace provide
photographic and physical surveillance coverage froa 1600-1630 hours :
on weekdays and from 0950-1300 hours on weekends. These changes were
dictated by the following considerations:

1, The new LIMOUSINE building offers s euch better vantage point a |
for both photographic and phyoical surveillance than does the :
presert corplex which houses the LILYRIC end LIMITED bases,

: Therefore, the Station felt that the personnel occupying this

. new base snould be those possessing the highest technieol skills
and also those able to provide the gost thorough ani coaplete

- coverase, Since the LIMITED base now has only one treined

; operator whils the LILYRIC basehouse hes tazee, the LILYRIC group
and a revision of working hours wes inifcatel.

@. Because it was apparent that the coverage cof the LIMERICK oy
Installation would be a long-range and continuing requiresent,

the Stetion desired to steff the new bese with personnel of long-

renge potential, LIEMPTY-6, now alacst €0 years cl, does not

possess this potential; however, the LILYRIC azeat complex

happily coabinses experienced personnel vith youthful acents.

3, Finally, the social and financisl status of the LILyaic
personnel fs auch sore compatible and consistent with tre en-
vironzent of the nev building than is that of the LIDTAD faetly.

operational tasks Lon Station Mexico City by the NMD and cther
directives, Mishel! ees of the accomplishments end the achievenents of

each component are ital below:

A. Pixed Baseheuses

1. LOTED

Throughout the pest Project year (with the change in working hours
noted in psrasrer % sdove), the LIMITED installation provided daily
photographic cores ani physical surveillance cf the nain gate of
the LIASAICK ins ion, In eddition, the LIMITED bese providei
for a fixed rai etehing station which was used continually to

sugport the LIOPALS surveillance tesa. Due to the strinsent
security seascr nstituted tn the lanediate vicinity of the LIMERICK

installetion by tres! security forces, norasl stake-outs by this
unilateral tesm sre precluded.

Mowever, with the radio dispatching
support from the LIMITED redio tese, which allows the LIMGRACE teae to
work froa edjs + safe areas, secure surveillance coverage of this .

1965 throvss 3¢ July 1066, the LIMITED base Srovide! 3,775 frawes
of operstions} photographd. In adiition, the LINTGD bese provided

over r 1,000 pases of physics] surveillance reports.

During—the-Preject year unier review, the LILYAIC installation

provided extensive photosraphic and fixei risusl surveillance of the
front of the LOCRICK installation, The LILYRIC dase act only pro-
vided the astority of the operational phetesraphs proluced ty the LIQGTY
project, but elso provided the aost detailal physical survetLlance
reports. - rin; the 9-month period cited in the LIMITSD section above,
the LILYRIS dese provided over 6,500 operational photosrephs ani 3,000
pages of prysical surveillance reports covering the daily eoveaents of

all LINSRICN allicers.

3, LICABLA
During sve cited Q-aonth period, the LICALIA installation provided

photosraphic ami physical surveillance coverase of the back of the
LIMERICK instsllation and its garden and pstio ares. This coverage
provided over 3,600 {individual photographs *s well as nuaerous sur
vetllance ani observation reports. It should be noted that the
LICALLA base allows Staticn Mexico City to observe the LIMERICK
personnel during their off-duty and recreational hours.

B. Sussarr of Fixed Rasehouse if fectivensss

The fixed LIRTIY bacehouses (LPATED, LICALLA and LILYRIC) provider
epproxisately 27,000 iniividuel frames of operationsl photcsgraphs
during the first Q«gonth perfod of ‘the pest project year, «Within the
last year, this photosreaphic coverage Linkai vith the physical
surveillance reports prepared by each basehouse, has proven to be a
gost reliable ead viable tocl for:

1. Followias the deily comings and Soinss of LINERICK personnel
ani inscisenous employees.

2, Comtiraing the identities ‘of LINSRICKX staffers an? their
visitors {sone of whoa are WOLADY citizens).

C. The Nobile Photographie Unite

1. Throughout the period! under review, the LICNTRAP Mobile photographie/
support unit was regularly exploited and used by Station Nexicc City.
Thia. unit provided over 1,0¢¢ individual photographs and was used in
support of Station operations anl activities. Of particular Value to
Station Mexico City and the JNPIGER prograa were nuserous photocraphs

of local and exile! Coawnist leaders provided by LLMRAP, In addition,
ths LISNTRAP personnel and unit was used regularly to service and :
obtain various postal accossolation boxes used by Nexico City, Head-

quarters and other field station» a
De OrRNDY - LTR nipal Agent.

During the pertod under review, with the exception of short vacation
periods, Reymond MN, GERAND:, continued in hio role as the Project
LIEMPIY principal agent, GERENDS operated as the full-tinzs cut-out
to the LISNTIY, LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses and bore the first

- echelon agent handling responsibility for the related personnel. Ia
addition, GSRENDS continued to pear the contact and headling res-
ponsibilities of the LISMNIAP wilt and for the operator of the LIEMPTY
photograpric developing/process{ng leboretory, LISOTY-4, GXHENDE's
overall operational assignnent involved at Least 172 clandestine aeetings
per week, in addition to his meetings with the LUAITY Project case
officer. It should also be noted that G2U2Ds sade nugerous anl essen
tial contributions to the sensitive AMIOD operction and assistei the
Station preatly with hin detailed sree knowledge in many instances.

E. Cvernl effectiveness

As outlined above, each individual operatLoasl codponent of the LIEKPTY
Profect contributed recularly and sicnificantly to the fulfilinent of
Station Mexico city's operational progres. Based on the continued
excellent perforsance and overell contributions of this project, the
Station strongly recdamends that this project be continued during the
forthcoming prosect year as an essential elesent of the Station's

operational support apparatus, ,

PROBING AND SSURLLY.

During the Project year unier review there vere no know incidents which
adversely affected the security of Project LIEMPIY or the related personnel.
The only simificant probdles enccunteral in the operation and adainistration
of this project ateaai froa the physical sove of the LILYHIC personnel to
the new base in the LIMOUSINE butliing. Muserous delays arising froa the
faulty perforasace of the local contractors and construction crews hampered
a timely relocation of this base, However, it io anticipated that the new
LILYRIC base will be in full operation by the end of Gctober 1966,

A. As outlined tn seracragh 6 of the Stetion's provious request for the
renewal of Project LIDNPZY, a progres Wno uadertaken to reaquip-ant aodernize
the LIEMPTY photosrajhtc processing base. During the past year, a signi
sicant portion of tue Naapaent used in the developing and processing
laboratory was replaced. As a resunt of this prograa, negatives and
Photographic prints of aich hisher quality are now bein; prolueed.
Consequently, only miner changes in the operation of the photozraphic
laboratory and its eqeipzent are conteaplated for the ensuing periot.

3. The present phystes) comlition, aileage and frequent use of the

LIIVTIUP unit dictates the izastinte replacement of this unit. Station

Nexico City has receives Xsadquearter's approval for the replaceseat of this ©

A. In the event of civil disoriers or the evolution of couplete or

that regular operational contact could be maintained with the majority of :
the active LIANPTY agents via Reymond A. GERMNDs or in his absence, @liver .

B. In the sost unlikely event of the estabLisheent of a regine “openly
hostile to LNFCIIE, Liaited contact could probably be anintained with the
majority of the ective Project agents. HNovever, under the cireuastances
described above, it is highly protabdle that tha isctivities of this Project

. Review of Project LIEMPTY
a . (For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

a CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed In relation to project
objectives):

1, “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personne! and physical facilities, "" SCANTLING has continued (See the
last two Project Reviews forwarded as attachments to HMMA- 14093,

13 November 1959, and HMMA-15979, 18 November 1960) to provide ©
worthwhile information pertaining to this objective,

a, During the past year SCANTLING has continued to be
used to follow up leads produced by LIENVOY. For example, _
operational Information recently indicated that the LIMERICK
target was using the services of a Mexico Clty firm to repair
safes, Through discreet investigation SCANTLING was able to:
identify the firm, its location and the name of the owner In the |
event that we later wished to make an approach to him or to
exploit this Information tn another manner, :

b. SCANTLING is still the Station’s primary source for
keeping current records on the residences of the many LIMERICK
personnel in Mexico City, This is accomplished in several ways;
the most important being SCANTLING's follow up of all LIENVOY
leads which indicate the LIMERICK people are interested In '
renting a given piece of property. (Sce previous project renewal
request for additional detalls),

1

2. "To collect operational information pertaining to other targets
of opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence
interest operating in Mexico." SCANTLING is very useful for collecting
information on other Station targets: j

SECRET /RSR
-2-

a, On the basis of a request to the Station from the
ODACID Chief, SCANTLING was sent to Puebla to be an

_ eyewitness to the 4 June 1961 Catholic inspired antt-CASTRO

demonstrations, Not only did SCANTLING obtain the destred
Information, and samples of many‘of the leaflets used, but he
prepared his report for the Station in time for the COS to give
the ODACID Chief a briefing at 1000 hrs,, 5 June 1961,
SCANTLING does an excellent job on this type of assignment
due principally to his ability to observe and report objectively,

b, SCANTLING was instrumental In establishing that
Fernando LLANES Cavero and his wife were living at a local
Mexico City address, This case has been of considerable
counterespionage interest to Headquarters,

ce. SCANTLING has continued his contributions to the
Paul Frederick KIRSCHHOFF case by periodic interviews with
the subject's neighbors and associates,

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings,

and surveillances. ' " SCANTLING has contributed to this objective both
directly and indirectly as will be noted by the examples listed below:

a,* SCANTLING devoted a lot of time to the
surveillance and attempted recruitment of Abel ARTEAGA, a
Mexican national employed at the Cuban Embassy, SCANTLING
talked with ARTEAGA several times and undoubtedly was
primarily responsible for the later success of the recruicment
made by another Statlon agent,

b, Some additional time was devoted to the Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez case in February 1961 when SCANTLING
determined that GONZALEZ was still in Mexico City. Sce
the last renewal for additional details on this case,

e¢. In connection with the above objective SCANTLING
has performed numerous pretext and neighborhood investigations
for the Station, SCANTLING also does most of the local ©
investigations requested by ODACID and other ODYOKE
components,

SECRET/KRSX
14-00000

SECRET /SK
-3-

. d, SCANTLING spent six weeks during July and
August of this year giving tradecraft and surveillance
- tralning to LIPAILS 5 and 7 from Monterrey. Although
this is.not a dtrect contribution to the above objective, tt
is considered sufficlently related to mention here, oe

4, In addition to his contributions to the above objectives,

-- SCANTLING Is used for miscellancous support requirements from the

Station, For example, SCANTLING is now handling LIEMBROIL-2 and
will continue to do so until the return of LIMOTOR-14 in June 1962, Also,

: during the past project yéar, SCANTLING handled the LIRICE surveillance

\ team until July 1961 when Simon D, CLACKETT (ps) returned to Mexico

* Clty. SCANTLING Is also used to spot and rent safe houses and apartments

for other Station operations,

5. As stated in the preceeding Requests for Project Renewal,
although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, It. is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING has made important and
valuable contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to
other Station activities tn general, SCANTLING's production, measured
agalnst monetary expenditures, case officer time and other Intangible factors,
unquestionably justifies his continuation as an integral part of Project

LIEMPTY.
8B. Raymond H, GERENDE Segment (discussed in relatlon to project

objectives):

1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facillttes through use of photographic base houses,"
Three photographic bases, LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA, contribute
to this objective, To avoid repetition, the Station is omitting the usual
description of the functions of these three bases and how thev contribute
to the above objective, “There has heen no change in the coverage as
described In the 1960 Request for Project Renewal.

2, "To collect operational information and identify operational

leads pertaining to Station targets cf opportunity."" The LIENTRAP
operation, handled by GERENDE, is still the major contrtbutor to this

SECRET 333K
14-00000

11

+ SECRET GK
-4- ,

objective, In addition to performing numerous photographic assignments
in support of other Station operations, LIENTRAP devoted nearly four
months, on 4 fulltime basis, to coverage of the LIERODE operation, For
several weeks the entire “take” from the LIERODE target was recor
from the LIENTRAP vehicle, Later, the LIENTRAP agents operated the
LIERODE technical gear from the inittal LIERODE stationary base.

3. “To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e.,
rent hotel rooms. and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances, "
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for other
Station operations and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive area
knowledge ard personal operational capabiltties combine to make him an
extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities. GERENDE
also procures and services post office box letter drops for the many

Station operations requiring them,

4, The quality and quantity of operational information produced
by the photographic bases and other activities under GERENDE's control
and supervision is considered worthwhile. The Station concludes, therefore,
that this segment of the LIEMPTY Project should be continued,

C, Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

As stated in the previous project renewal, it can readily be noted
that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to many Station operations and
in this maaner has been a contributing factor to the furthereance of the
Related Mission Directive. The project has not produced any positive
intelligence nor has it been intended that it should do so. 2 project's sole
purpose is to provide a mechanism for the development of operational
{nformation in support of other Station operations,

CHANGES
There have been no changes in the LIEMPTY Project during the past project

year except that SCANTLING relinquished control of the LIRICE (formerly LIJERSEY)
surveillance team in July 1961 in accordance with previous plans,

Wl,» EFFECTIVENESS ___

; There has been no change in Project LIEMPTY which would alter the
validity of the remarks made In Section It of last year's project renewal request,

WV. PROBLEMS

The security problem in connection with the LICALLA operation, which
was described in last year's renewal request, is still present but has not caused
any known difficulty, At Headquarters suggestion in HMMW-9736, the LICALLA
base was reactivated on 29. May..1961. The base operator has been cautioned to be
ever alert for any unusual.incidents which might indicate that the base has been
compromised, This is the only problem experienced by the LIEMPTY Project

during the past project year,

Vv. PLANS

. The Station considers that the project is now operating at its optimum size
and does not plan to expand it during the coming year. Rather, efforts will be
-devoted to refining and better utilizing the existing project organizational

arrangements,
Vi, COSTS

A, Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project LIEMPTY
expended-$21, 458,00 during Fiscal Year 1961 (1 December 1960 - 30 June 1961) and
has thus far during Fiscal Year 1962 (through 30 September 1961) expended about
$11,000.00. It is anticipated thar abour $8, 000.00 will be expended during the last
two months (October and November 1961) of the project.year, This will make a
total expenditure during the project year of about $40, 500.00, or some $12, 500.00
under the budget estimate of $53, 000.00.

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $49,500.00 budget, itemized below,

$29, 500.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year 1962 and the
. balance, $20,000.00 should be expended during Fiscal Year 1963. Normal accounting

procedures will be used for all expenditures,

(For the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I, CURSENT CRJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

. ceo aa “Ae Qliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation
to project objectives):

1, "To collect operational information per=
taining to LIMERICK personnel and physical .
facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the
last Project Review forwarded as an attachment -
to HiMA=14093, 13 November 1959) to provide
worthwhile and significant information per=
taining to the above objective. There follow

a few examples of SCANTLING's productions

& <A detailed casing of the LIMERICK
electrical power supply was forwarded

to Eeadquarters as an attachment to
HMMA-14496, 12 February 1960. The pro=
duction of this type of operational
information, which takes several weeks
to compile accurately, illustrates the
unueual talents possessed by SCAKTLING
together with his valuable contributions
to the Station's operational information

collection effort,

b. SCANTLING has been used frequently

to follow up leads produced by LIFHAT/
LINSRICK (now produced by LIENVOY). For
example, in May 1960, LIFEAT indicated

that the LIMERICK target was having con—
siderable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES
conceruing the handling of incoming and
outgoing shipments, By discreet investi~
gation, SCANTLING was able to provide the
Station with additional pertinent information
about the address, owner and type of business
engaged in by the firm. Such information

then becomes readily available for exploitation

should a LIMERICK shipment of oarticular
interest come to the attention of the Station.

ec. SCANTLING is the Station's primary
investigative asset for keeping track of -
current residence addressees of LIMERICK
persernel, The Station considers it important
from the counterespionage standpoint te main-
tain informaticn con the lecat ef at

LIMERICK residences. In addition, specific
targeto are continually considered for LICOOL
installations, A recent example of SCALTLING's

efforts in-this cormection wuld be the spote
ting and acquisition of the LIMOTCR base in
the same apartment building with LITALOK <1.
Contributions of this type operational informa=
‘tion are quite time consuring due to the
necessity for checking cut several apartments
that a LIMERICK individual may initially be
considering as a residence.

2. "To collect cperational information pertaining to -
other targets of opportunity, foreign official installa~
tions and personnel of intelligence interest operating ~
in Mexico." Aa indicated below, SCANTLING is also
extremely useful for collecting information on targets
other then LIMERICK: .

@e In March 1960 SCANTLING wag instrumental,
in locating property adjacent to the LITABBY
installation which the Stetion has since

rented in anticipation of initiating photo~
grephie and technical operations, SCANTLING ~
was able to accomplish this assignment only
after a thorough casing end pretext investi-+
gations of the several pieces of property
appropriate for such operations,

be. SCAITLING is also used to follow up
sensitive leads in connection with LIFEAT
and LIENVOY production from LITABBY and
sister ¢ gets (See example as to type
under I,A,1, b and ¢ above).

Ce SCAMTLING was uscd ec an investigative
asset to determine the local address and
exact employment of Gorden William GKOVES
(201~220025), a counterespionage case of
intereet to Headquarters and ODENVY.

3. "To exploit operational leads through recruitments
debriefings, and surveillances." As examples of
SCANTLIIG's contritution to this objective, the
following cases are listed:

a. SCAXTLING devoted a considerable amount
of time to his attempts to locate Cesar
GONZALEZ Sanchez, a known agent of a Com
munist Country. He followeé various leads
on GONZALEZ fron Karen | to “ered 196C before

14-0000

GONSALES was finally identified and his

Mexico City home aid business addresses were

ascertained. See HMMA~25626, 9 September 1960, .
for further details on this cases

Lon, “ >... The preliminary investigative work on a
. KUSCDA case of priority interest was conducted
~ by SCAXTLING. During this investigation it
. was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to
. Aquascalientes, Guanajuato md Minatitlan to
eek, obtain the information required by Headquarters,
n See the attachments to HiT-1416, 20 May 1960,
for the results of the investigation.

4 In addition to his contributions to the above objece
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support

requirements of the Station. For example, SCANTLING |
handled several of Raymond He GEREKDE's (ps) operations

while the latter was away from Mexico City during August

and September 1960, Also, SCANTLING has been managing

the LIJERSEY surveillance team since the departure of

Simon D. CLACKETT in August 1960, It is hoped that

SCANTLING can be relieved of this assignment as soon

as the LITEMPO project is approved, SCANTLING has also

been used to spot and rent safe houses for various

Station operations, a valuable operntional support.

service.

5- As stated in the preceeding Request for Project
Renewal, al though SCANTLING's LIELPIY Project objectives
can never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's
opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically
and to other Station activities in general. SCANTLING's
: ‘ production, measured against monetary expenditures,
. case officer time and other intangible ractors, uiqucs=
ticnably justifies his continuation as a integral part

of Froject LIEMPIY.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives): ;

1. "To collect operational information pertaining ‘to
LIMERICK personnel and physical fecilities through ‘use
of photographic base houses." Together with their
extensive photographic coverage of the LIMERICK target,
the photographic bases also contribute other types of
operational information: !

a, LIMITED + This base compiles daily logs '
indicating all arrivals, demrtures and,
where possible, identities of every person ,
visiting or working at the LI} CK targete.

14-0000

“SECRET AGGRO

— a4

. ‘This information Is particularly useful in keeping track of

LIMERICK personnel and asststing with the identification of
visitors to the Wistallation, Also, LIMITED maintains a
summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a datly
basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day,

. Finally, one other significant service ts performed hy this

base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMSRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity,
LIMITED's photographic coverage ts still concentrated on
visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK
installation, A recent example of the base's cantributions to
Station efforts is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this
case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit

the LIMERICK target on a certain day, The base was alerted

to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any
person appearing to be an American, The results of this
assignment were Indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other
cables, LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,
which when compared with photographs provided by Head-
quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity,

b, LILYRIC - This base's ourput of high-quality clandestine

photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year.
In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-l4, prepares weekly
reports on LIMERICK empioyees and their wives, VILYRIC
alsu periorms the assignment of noting and reporting the
license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the’
LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC photograplis also are con-
centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed ro employees,
It should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic
coverage during the hours from daylight to,1400 hours each

.. day of the week except Sunday, The LIMITED base maintains

photographic coverage from 1400 hours to darkness each day
except Sunday,

c. LICALLA - As reported in previous correspondence, the
LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational

information through photographic coverage of LIMERICK
employees and their families, Also, the base operator,

coverage of the target, both photographic and physical
observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK
personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-

esplonage effort,

| 2, “To collect operational information and tdentlfy operational leads

, pertaining to Station targets of opportunity.” The LIENTRAP operation,

: : handled by GERENDE, ts the major contributor to this objective, It

! has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform
pretext {nvestigetions in support of numerous Station activities, The
cases listed below are cited as examples:

a, Inthe case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3,a, above)
LUENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ, at his
Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters
provided: photographs, left no doubt that GONZALEZ was the
subject of interest to Headquarters,

b. LIENTRAP confirmed the Identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,
a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent
supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext
investigation of. the residents of an apart ment building where
CASTILLO was believed to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the
results of the Investigation with excellent photographs of the

subject, ° -

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i,e., rent
hotel roorns and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances, "
GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for
other Station operations and activities, GERENDE's comprehensive
area knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to make
him aa extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities.
GERENDE also procures post office box letrer drops for the many
Station operations requiring them,

4. It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time
expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project 1s worthwhile and
should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational
information produced,

"Simon D, CLACKETT Segment (discussed tn relatton'to project

objectives):

1, “To collect operational tnformatton and to identify operational leads
pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets.of opportunity,"
During this project year the LYERSEY survelllance team under the
direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support
efforts through pretext investigattons and physical surveillances, Some
examples of the team's work are listed below:

a, Rafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372) is a Guatemalan
Communist which the team had under surveillance from
November 1959 to April 1960, The survelllance, together

with Information acquired from other sources, eventually
resulted in an‘unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHLER,

b, Pericles FRANCO Ornes (201-64546) - FRANCO is a

Dominican of interest to the Station, The LIJERSEY ream

devoted portions of five mouths, January to May 1960, collecting

information on subject through physical surveillance, '

ec. Jose Maria "Chema" LOPEZ Valdizon (201- ) was the
subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960,
LOPEZ was iater deported from Meaive ilroiigi: the efforts
of LITEMPO-2.

d. CLACKETT and the LIJERSEY team performed numerous
pretext Investigations on Station targets cf opportunity and on
three separate occasions during the project year served as

a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other

operations,

2. CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent i
about five weeks giving tradecraft and operational skills training to wo
LITEA-1. Although not specifically covered by the project objectives, . ot
this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con- :
tribution to the Station's support efforts, :

August: 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LUERSEY team to
the. LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project wipl

- not-be renéwed, However, for the record, it is considered that -
__ the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the
~~ expenditure of Station assets in connection with LIJERSEY operations

were justified,

-D, Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

It can readily be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to
many Station operations and tn this manner has been a contributing factor
to the furtherance of the Related Misston Directive, The project has not
produced any positive intelligence nor has it been tntended that it should
do so, The project's sole purpose {s to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station
operations,

te CHANGES
A. Simon D, CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has
necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LJUERSEY surveillance
team and still benefit from the training and expertence gained by the team
during the past year. As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY tcam on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would
permit the Station vv cunituue io profit from CLACKETT's pagt efforts,

B. Oliver G, SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT’s departure, SCANTLING has been handling the
LYERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of
the LITEMPO project. SCANTLING has been exposed to, and likewlse
knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20. SCANTLING is

known to L-2G only by an alias,

iV. PROBLEMS Se

A, Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in.
September 1960 as a direct. result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government, One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA’ Is located in one
of these units) and the Station considered it appropriate to. suspend photo-
graphic operations: “pending resolution of the situation, At this time,

. there ts no indication when’LICALLA operations will be resumed, . The

> “LICAELLA base operator has reported that.there have been no unusual

inquiries or other suspictous actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has’ been compromised to LIMERICK personnel; however, sucha
possibility will exist until the release of the three technicians. No
other security problems have occurred during the past year.

Vv. PLANS.
A. Processing of Photographs-- During the past year considerable

‘progress has been made in the Station's handling, i.e,, sorting, indexing, ;
identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced by the several bases, - |

B. Photographic T echniques - Thé previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal

Request indicated that the Station planned to try new techniques using

HY~-PAN film in_night photography.—HY¥.-PAN_film_was_used_on_a-trial

from HY-PAN negatives were too grainy and, consequently, were of
little use. in producing good identified shots of individuals, In view
of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted,
It should be noted that Eastman: Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which
all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously
used by the Starion for clandestine photography, The quality ofall -

base phorographs have been increased considerably as a direct résult
of this new film, . .

C, General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time, It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his interim
responsibility for the LYERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
investigative and casing activities. The transfer of the LIJERSEY team

- to Project LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an

appreciable amount. It ts not planned, during the coming year, to
expand present LIEMPTY activities,

COSTS

A, Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120. 91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (L December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734,69. Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $50,000.00. An additional
$4, 000, 00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year,
This will bring rotal project expenditures to about $54, 000. 00 for the
entire project year,

B. Ensuing Period - Of the total $53,000.00 budget, itemized below,
$31, 900.00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year
1961 and the balance, $21,100.00, should be expended during Fiscal
Year 1962, Normal accounting procedures will be used for all
expenditures,

EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

As regards the requirement listed in CSI-F No, 230-60, Annex A, for
communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions,"
the Station does nor anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives. However, both principal

’ agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile
sources of information to mainrain contact with under any adverse
conditions, Both of these agenrs identity themselfs, in terms of
ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as
Mexican nationals (which they are), It is reasonable to assume, there-
fore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE ‘would become valuable contacts
in any emergency situation, :

Service), At the time of the incident the LIENTRAP vehicle was
carrying out en ‘assignment of photographing a Cuban rally which it
was expected would be attended by many of the leading Mexican and
Central American Communists, The police were also covering the
meeting for thé-purpose of preventing a Communist-inspired demonstra=
tion and they searched LIENTRAP believing it might contain Communist
propaganda, When they saw the film they seized the filn,the truck and
LIEMPTY-10 with the belief the Communists had filmed sane rough-handed
techniques used by the police against some persons attending the rally.
LIEMFTY-10 was held under unofficial custody for approximately 26 hours
before his release was obtained, When a member of the Station using
State Department covor intervened with the police on behalf of LIEMFTY-10,
the film, LIENTRAP, and all the equipment were also returned in tact,
LIEMFPTY-10 had not been. interrogated and had not been formally charged
or booked, . Although the FBI representative and the U.S. Embassy Security
Officer also learned of the incident, the Station doas not believe that
this incident has materially effected the security of the Project. The

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY

(Eor the Purpose of Project Renewal)

I. PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives): .

wt 1, “To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities." During the past year SCANTLING has devoted

a significant amount of time to the furtherance of this project objective. Although
other Station operations and personnel-are also concerned with vie collection of
operational information about- LIMERICK personnel, SCANTLING's contributions

are unique as to type and complement information received from other sources, For
‘example, SCANTLING is used primarily as the source of information about LIMERICK
physical facilities. He is constantly on the alert for building modifications, con-
struction activities and the kinds of outside services utilized by the LIMERICK
installation. He regularly visits Inez PARADA de Moreno, the occupant of property
adjacent to LIMERICK, for the purpose of obtaining a close view of the interior
grounds of LIMERICK and to debrief Senora de Moreno about any unusual activities
which she may have-observed. At the present time SCANTLING is preparing a
thorough casing report on the electrical power supply used by LIMERICK and all
other residences and establishments in the same block. This operational information
is intended for KURIOT's use and will show all transformers in the block, electrical
meters for measuring the amount of electrical power used and the precise points
where wires enter each property. Because of his other sensitive activities and
because other operational activities provide adequate coverage, SCANTLING

has been used sparingly for physical surveillances and investigations which might
conceivably impair his future usefulness to the Station. During the time he spent
training Simon D. CLACKETT (ps) in radio controlled mobile surveillance,
SCANTLING did perform some surveillance work at the LIMERICK installation;
however, it was concerned mostly with briefing CLACKETT on dispatching tech-
niques and the procedures used for the control of several vehicles on a surveillance

team using two-way radios.

2. “To collect operational information pertaining to other targets of
opportunity, foreign official installations and personnel of intelligence interest
operating in Mexico." By far the most important contribution made by SCANTLING
in connection with this project objective has been his support to the LITACIT
operation and just recently actually gained entry to the LITACIT target using a
pretext cover story, During this visit SCANTLING managed to collect highly
valuable operational information about the security of the installation, which has

.added materially to KUBARK.'s knowledge about the-terget. SCANTLING has also

cased and prepared reports on the LITABBY target in anticipation of mounting

. 1 22-

a photographic surveillance and in initial preparation for a future LINIMENT type
activity. SCANTLING has performed investigations of numerous other Station
targets of opportunity which, depending on their significance, have been reported

-in separate correspondence.

3. “To exploit operational leads through recruitments, debriefings
and surveillances." This objective was included in the LIEMPTY project because
SCANTLING is used to follow up LIFEAT leads and leads obtained from the LIEMPTY

‘photographic bases. During the past year SCANTLING has investigated a quantity of

leads obtained from the above sources, The information resulting from these in-
vestigations has enabled the Station to maintain current data on the various firms
used by the LIMERICK target and in one instance, Octavio VIDALES (201- )
caused the Station to make a recruitment pitch in an effort to carry out a technical
penetration of the LIMERICK target. Although VIDALES was not recruited, the
Station anticipates that SCANTLING will some day be successful in just this type of
activity. SCANTLING ia the Station's principal source for the follow-up of LIFEAT/
LIMERICK and LIEMPTY photographic base house leads as they pertain to the

primary target.

4." Not covered by a specific project objective but, névertheless, of
significant importance to the Station are SCANTLING's contributions to the overall
Station support efforts. In addition to the extensive training given to CLACKETT,
SCANTLING also prepared a detailed and sophisticated radio dispatch procedure for
use by the LIEMBRACE surveillance team. He devised a superior method for
numbering streets which enables the radio surveillance team to specify a location
without reference to street names and areas. The entire radio dispatch code, when
used properly, practically defies identification as the conversations of a clandestine
surveillance team. From the standpoint of Station security, SCANTLING conducted
an investigation of LIVESTOCK-2 based on two leads which were 30 years old and
reported significant information which contributed to the Station's final decision
to terminate LIVESTOCK-2, SCANTLING's other support activities consist of renting
hote! rooms and apartments in fictitious names, supporting operations such as
LICOOL-12 by performing sentry duty and by serving as a capable and responsible
cutout between the Station and agents from other geographical areas.

5. Although SCANTLING's LIEMPTY objectives can never be completely
fulfilled, it is the Station's opinion that SCANTLING'has made important and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically and to other Station
activities in general, SCANTLING's production, méasured against monetary .
expenditures, case officer time and other intangible factors, unquestionably justifies
his continuation as an integral part of Project LIEMPTY.

- :..1, "To collect operational information pertaining to LIMERICK
personnel and physical facilities through the use of photographic base houses."
This continuing objective is carried out by three photographic base houses, -

LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA. During the project year, LIMITED produced
’ approximately 3600 photographs and LILYRIC about 4500 pictures of individuals
» entering and leaving the LIMERICK target. Most of these photographs were of

non-LIMERICK individuals of which only a small, but significant, percentage

could be identified through license plate checks or other types of routine investi-

The LICALLA base produced approximately 4300 photographs during the year.

Most of the LICALLA photographs were of LIMERICK employees and their families

and have been of considerable value in.maintaining current and accurate listings

of LIMFRICK personnel in Mcxico. Tho LICALLA base has recently begun taking
These

movies are being forwarded to KUTUBE/D for the possible exploitation of lip

- veading analysis, ‘The LIMITED base, in addition to its photographic assignment,

is also used as thé radio central for dispatching the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel targets. All bases make routine reports on the daily
attendance of LIMERICK employees at the installation which facilitates the Station's
reporting on the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel, Also, the bases
devote time to reporting the personal associations among the numerous LIMERICK
employees. Some of this latter type information is valuable from the standpoint of
confirming that LIMERICK intelligence officers have a tendency to associates with

their colleagues,

2, "To collect operational information and identify operational
leads pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," This is a broad objective
and one which is contributed to by the LIENTRAP operation. LIENTRAP is used
to provide photographic coverage of important Station targets which do not justify
a more permanent photographic base. During the period under review, LIENTRAP
has been used for the timely coverage of various Central American exile group
activities, the Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)

. headquarters, several counterespionage targets, the LITACIT and LITABBY
targets and other one-time operations of intelligence interest.

The operational

information produced by LIENTRAP is used by the Station for increasing
operational knowledge about a target and, when appropriate, has been incorporated
in separate reports to Headquarters with other information about specific targets.

3. "To provide operational support to Station operations, i.e., rent
hotel rooma and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances."" GERENDE,
because of his area knowledge and operational acumen, is used frequently by the
Station for renting hotel rooms and apartments in fictitious names for use on other
Station operations, He is also the Station's principal procurer of local Post Office
boxes for use as letter drops, This objective pertains entirely to the operational
support of other Station operations and is an invaluable ingredient to the security
of important Station activities.

SECRE TASER

4. The production of operational information as represented by
LIMITED, LILYRIC, LICALLA and LIENTRAP is an important adjunct to the
Station's coverage of the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity.
tis the Station's conclusion that the expenditure of KUBARK assets, i.e., money
and case officer time, is justified and that these activities should be continued.

Cc. Simon D. CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project objectives):

1 “To collect operational information and to identify operational
leads pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity."" Very
little production has been realized from this objective in terms of CLACKETT's
contributions. CLACKETT returned to Mexico in early April 1959 after receiving
surveillance, tradecraft and photography training in Headquarters. He then spent the
rest of April, May and part of June being trained by SCANTLING in mobile sur=
veillance techniques. Then LIEMPTYs 15, 16, 17 and 20 were placed under his
supervision and he began training these agents in the arts of foot surveillance and
mobile surveillance, This team, known’as the LISERSEY team, is just beginning to
show the excellent effects of CLACKETT's intensive training sessions. Although
LIEMPTY-17 has resigned and the team consists of only four agents, including
CLACKETT, the Station believes that the team will be ready within the next month
to begin its contributions to the above objective.

2. Based on the training time devoted to CLACKETT and to the LIJERSEY
team and the anticipated production during the coming project year, it is the Station's
opinion that this activity should be continued,

i EXTENT TO WHICH THE RELATED MISSION DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN
FURTHERED.

Project LIEMPTY has provided support, in varying ways, to a majority of

* Station operations and in this manner has been a contributing factor to the furtherance

of the Related Mission Directive, The project is not intended nor designed to
produce positive intelligence; its sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station operations,

mi. PROGRESS OF THE OPERATION AND PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE.

a. Oliver G. SCANTLING Segment:

i, SCANTLING's duties and responsibilities are basically the same
now as they were when the original LLEMPTY project outline was submitted, Since
SCANTLING is the only major factor in this part of LLEMPTY, progress, other than
covered in the above section on production, can be measured only by the fact that
SCANTLING is a year older and has acquired a few more helpful tricks of the trade

+ surveillance team has been a progressive step for the development of an additional
+ and much needed support ascet.

. SECRE T/aquscmaaR :
-5-

and, consequently, has increased hie own operational abilities.

2. Insofar as future ‘planning is concerned, SCANTLING will
continue to devote the’ greater portion of his time to the LITACIT operation. In
addition, he will continue his work against the LIMERICK target, i.e., investi-
gating LIFEAT and photographic base house leads in connection with the objectives
of the LIEMPTY and LIMESA projecte. The Station still plans to maintain
SCANTLING as an independent Station assct free from the responsibilities of super-

vising other agente and operations,

3. SCANTLING will probably continue providing administrative
support to LIEMPTY-3 (now covered under the LICOOL project), but will not be
responsible for the operational direction of L-3 :

B. Raymond H. GERENDE Segment:

1 During the past year the three photographic base houses have

. been trained in the use of a faster type film (HY-PAN) to facilitate the taking of

photographs on dark cloudy days. One base, LICALLA, has made tests and recently
begun making 35mm color slides using the new fast type Ektachrome film. This
film is now processed in the Mexico Station dark room which heretofore was not
possible. It ia the Station's opinion that a few color photographs of target personnel
will be useful for identification purposes, The LICALLA Bage has also, during the
past year, begun taking 16mm motion pictures in color with the expectation that
Headquarters can eventually provide lip reading analysis of conversations taking
place in the garden area of the LIMERICK installation. :

2. Other operational progress has been made in connection with
relieving GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance team, This
mow leaves GERENDE with a sufficient amount of time to supervise all photographic
base houses, LIENTRAP and the outside photographic laboratory. ,

3. Future planning in relation to this segment does not call for
expansion. Rather,. the Station plans to perfect some of the photographic procedures
now in use and to experiment with night photography possibilities using the fast
HY-PAN film with telephoto lens of varying lengths. GERENDE will also concentrate
on increasing the security and communications procedures used with each base,

C. Simon D, CLACKETT Segment:

1, CLACKETT's assumption of responsibility for the LISERSEY

Although the LISERSEY team has been in existence
for several years, 1t was only durimg the past year, with the asaignment of

~ | CLACKETT, that an intensive cffort was made to train the team members and to

‘; place them under the-supervision of a full time team leader. As mentioned above,
CLACKETT has done‘an excellent job during the past few months in getting the
team ready for future operational assignments,

2 The Station plans, during the coming year, to increase the
.._strength of the LIJERSEY team by at least two agents and one car. This would
then give a total LISERSEY complement of six agents and three radio cars. The
Station will continue to take all necessary precautions not to rush the development
of the team nor to give it assignments which are too complicated and too difficult.
It ia anticipated that the team will begin some surveillance work within the next
month on targets connected with plans for an expanded Communist Party pene-

tration program,

Iv. PERFORMANCE OF PRINCIPAL AGENTS IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION,

SECURITY AND COVER. . : of fet

. A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - As should be expected from a well trained
and motivated agent, SCANTLING's production during the period under review was
excellent, His production is in the category of operational information rather than
positive intelligence and is based on leads and investigations given him by the
Station, He never fails to do a thorough and detailed Job on all assignments

given to him, He is an unusually valuable principal ag: agent, > There have been no
security problems or developments during the past year in connection with
SCANTLING's assignments, Likewise, his cover is very good and places him

in a position to maintain his work for KUBARK for many years to come.

B. Raymond H. GERENDE - Since GERENDE's marriage in December
1958, his performance has improved to a marked degree, He has become one
of the Station’s most dependable agents in terms of promptness for meetings,
completing operational assignments as rapidly as possible and in doing any task,
regardless of how menial it may be. Insofar as the Station and GERENDE know,
his cover with LISTERINE's firm has held up very well, In fact, GERENDE
recently wag able to negotiate a sales contract with a customer having a very J
large sales capacity for the product manufactured by LISTERINE's firm, This,
of course, endears GERENDE to LISTERINE in addition to contributing to
GERENDE's cover employment, The only significant security incident pertaining,
in part, to GERENDE was in connection with LIENTRAP (please see HMMA-13951,

16 October 1959, for details).

Cc. Simon D, CLACKETT - CLACKETT's performance has definitely

measured up to the standards expected by the Station. He has proved that he
‘ is conscientious, dependable and very quick in grasping the details of clandestine
iviti He will undoubtedly continue to improve his personal performance as

activities,

he gains more experience, ‘There have been no security problems or incidents in
connection with CLACKETT's assignment to this Station. Although the notional

‘cover provided by Headquarters has held up very well during the past few months,
- the Station had hopes of placing him in LILABEL's firm and obtaining Inmigrante

‘However, for reasons mentioned in other correspondence, thie
The Station is continuing efforts to locate

another suitable local cover job for CLACKETT.

V.’ CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION, »
[2 - CONTACT AND COMMUNICATION.

A. Oliver G. SCANTLING - The Station Case Officer meets with SCANTLING
on the average of three times each week, For regular meetings, a total of eight
Prearranged contact points are used alternately with SCANTLING walking the beat"
and being picked up by the Case Officer in the latter's car. This procedure enables
both the agent and the case officer to check themselves and to check each other for
possible surveillance. Meetings are generally of short duration, seldom more than
30 minutes, and are held in the car. It is possible for SCANTLING to get in touch
with his case officer by telephone, and vice versa, in case an unscheduled meeting
is necessary. SCANTLING and the Station are currently working on the details of
an emergency means of contact utilizing SCANTLING's wife's relatives in PBPRIME.
Headquarters will be advised of.these arrangernents to facilitate contact with
SCANTLING in the event Mexico ia overrun by hostile forces and contact with the

Station is severed,

B. Raymond H. GERENDE - GERENDE's Case Officer meets with him five
times each week, Meetings are conducted in the Case Officer's car using the same
+ proceduree as outlined above. GERENDE and his Case Officer have a total of 11
contact points in different areas of the city and yenerally hold their mectings during
the early morning hours, usually about 0800. As in the case of SCANTLING,
GERENDE and his Case Officer are preparing an emergency contact procedure which
will facilitate Headquarters communications with him through his relatives in PBPRIME
Headquarters will be advised of these arrangements just as soon as they are completed.

Cc, Simon D, CLACKETT ~ The Station Case Officer meets with CLACKETT

on the averageof three times each week. The same type of communications pro-
cedures as used for SCANTLING and GERENDE are employed with CLACKETT,

MEMORANDUM FoRs Chiof, FI/ors

FROM 1 Chief, WD.
SUBJECT .  s LIEPTY Project , -

1. Reference is nade to your comments on the LIE-TTY Projact which was
approved on 16 January 1959.

2. Tho LISUFTY Project provides for tha development of tho former
LIJEASZY aurveilicnes tenn, tho mintenarce of photo surveillance bases, and
other support facilities for the Mexico City station. In their review of the
Project before it vis anroved, FI/OPS sugrested that WH Division consider a
gPadval reduction of tho consierable financial and personnal cosmiteents in
thio project in view of the favorably develoring LYENVCY liatscn relationship.
FI/OPS bolieved that a omaller, more managoable support group with greater
emphasia on oelectivity of tasks ani targets could well result in more effective

CI and FI produstivity..

3. The Mexican desk wishes to point out that rather than reducing tho
assets carried unter the LIC-PTY Froject, WED velfeves that this rrofect is
an oxtromely important ona and should receive Head:uarters support. Tho only
other Station aurveilliu.ce teans, LIVESTOCK and LISMPRACE, are both knoun
to the Mexican suthorities, Therefore LISFTY remains the Station's only
secure surveillerce agset. It ie a very onal] untrained unit at present, but

First, the liaison has n-t yet been firmly established. Secondly, oven with a
good Jiaison relationship, the Mexiean ssrvicea must be considered anything but
seoure, and certainly could not be trusted with any sensitive operations.
Thirdly, because of its proxinity to the United States, end the activity of
hostile Intellivence groups thers, the Mextéo City Station ia called upon to
support many very sensitive orerations vhich we would never wish to reveal to

1. The Field. Project Outline submitted with HM'A-11257 was approved
on 16 January 1959 without change, for the period 1. Decenber 1958 through
30 Novender 1959 for a total of 195,330; $65,590 for the current fiscal
year and 329,800 for fiscal year 1960.

2. An amondment to the original request for project approval wes
gubaitted before the original project was approved, this anendment
requested approval to include Simon De CLACKET? (ps) and Wilma J. FIORVALISI
(ps) uncer the LIF#PTY Project effective 1 January 1959 and remove then
fron the LIMGSA Project. The funds designated in the original FPO for
the undesignated Staff Agent were used to cover the expenses for CLACKETE
and FIORDALISI. Therefore no additional funds were requested for the
project 4 this anendrent. ‘he approval on 16 January 1959 included tiie
project anendment, A copy of the avendment request is being forwarded

fer your information and records.

3. dnong the Staffs' comments on the LIENPIY Project, the following
recommendations were made. KUDESX suggested that the Case Officer should
work at davising ostensible sources of incomes for the agents whieh will
stand the scrutiny of friends, relatives and less friendly forces. —

4. 4n amendrent to CLACKET('s contract has been requested to allow
for a cuarters allowance. The eduertional allowance requested in paragrash
LA ef the project amendment was disap-roved because CLACKETT was a Contract
Agent. The Quarters Allowance of £2,590 was turned dow because it was too
high in relation to CLACKETI's salary. Therefore, a quarters alloxcuce of
23,800 has been annroved and will be written into CLACXSTi's contract. If,
however, opsrational and cover reasons require CLACKET: to rent an apartment
Yarger tuan the one he would normally obtain under his allowance, tie Ciief
ef Etation can authorise the extra rent as an operational expense which will
rot be considered as conpensation for CLACKET? and thorefore not subject te .

federal income tax.

PROJECT OUTLINE
CRYPTONM_ LrEwery ;

PART I

“Area of Operations
fhe general area of operations will be Mexico and the specific area will be
Mexico, D.F., Mexico.

2. Purpose

‘The purpose of this project is to-provide a mechanim for the development of

operational information in support of other Station operations. This purpose is
in conéonance with the Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

3. Background

As the reviewing authorities will be aware, this project includes several

operations which were formerly carried under Projects LIPSTICK and LIJERSEY.

Partially as a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK compromise, when three surveillance
tean members were apprehended and placedin custody by the Mexican Police, and
additionally as a means for the orderly administration of assets, this new project
ia submitted, .

There follovs delow a background aketeh of the separate support assets, excluding

details concerning personnel which will be discussed later in the outline, which the

Station proposes for inclusion in LIEMPTY:

LIMITED - The LIMITED Base is located in such a position acrogs the street
from the LIMERICK installation that photographs can easily be made of persons enter-
ing and leaving the LINERICK main gate. These photogrephs are later developed and
printed by LIEMPTY-4, then returned to the LIMITED operator for the proper annotations.
After receipt’ of the photographs by the Station, the Case Officer reviews them for
LIMESA leads, newly arrived LIMERICK personnel, local and other nationals of possible
operational interest and PBPRIME citizens who have visited LIMERICK.

KUBARK owns the property housing the LIMITED Base, having purchased it in mid-
1955; however, the ostensible omer is LIMOUSINE, to whom LIEMPTY-6 pays hia rent

each month through LIMOUSINE's bank.

LIMITED, with LIEMPTY-6 as base house operator, has been operating fr nearly
three years and has not yet been involved in a compromising security situation. Prior
to April 1955, when Headquarters authorized the purchase of the LIMITED Base, the
Stution rented the Base and used LIPSTICK-7 (later LIMESTONE-6 in LIFEAT Project
and now terminated) as the operator. This arrangement was in effect for about two

years.

Lirxare , This Base’ has ‘been in oparation for stout two and one-half years
_ and is located fa an epartaent buildtag acros s the street fron the LIMERICK

‘persons entering asi Jeavii ig the main gate of the LIMERICK installation, The - a
-: LELYRIC photographs. led..in- the same manner as the LIMITED pictures. In t
additioa to taking photograplis; the LILYRIC operators also prepare daily logs on the?”

i Pedple to and ‘trou the LINSRICK installation; and prepare an observation
setat porosity personnel seea éach day. (This peraits the Station to tell when
ty 4s cut’ of tov or not working for sone other reason.)

me LILYRIC Base-waa originally acquired and made operative to provide for
Continuous’ coverage of the target in the event LIMITED is ever compromised. This
is still the primary value of having two bases cover the same portion of the target.
LILYRIC is -compartmented fron LIMITSD and with the possible exception of GERENDE
could probably weather any security flap involving LIMITED. Obviously, there is
‘some duplication in the work of LIMITED and LULIRIC) bowaver, the insurance value
of having two basis is quite apparent. - Mee .

LILYRIC has been operating for about two and one-half years and insofar as
the Station knows, no compromising security situations have arisen.

LICALLA ~ The LICALLA Base is located in a position where photographs can be
taken of people within the LIMERICK garden | area. In addition, the operator of the
‘LICALLA Base submits weekly reports on’ LIMERICK construction work, daily logs show-
ing when a target individual was seen that day, and reports showing the association
of target.individuals with one another. LICALLA photographs are processed and handled
in the same manner and by the people who handle the LIMITED and LILYRIC pictures.

: The LICALLA Base was acquired and operations besan about two and one-half
yeare ago with ‘the primary purpose of obtaining additional operational information
concerning LIMERICK personnel, and operational leads which could be exploited for

. the physical penetration of the LINSRICK installation. Approximately one year ago

the LICALLA, Base waa purchased by KUBARK through LIMOUSINE. LICALLA will probably
remain st its present location and will continue to submit photographs and reports
of the same type as are now being submitted. Other than the fact that LIEMPTY-9,
the LICALLA operator, is the brother of former LIPSTICK-47, no security problems are

" eurrently known to the Case Officer. However, reports from LIPSTICK2 12 and 30, the

local police, the attorneys involved in the case, the foreign embassy concerned and
the LCFLUTTER tests give no indications that LIEMPTY-9 was ever mentioned during
the LIPSTICK flap.

LOUSRTRAP - This is a panel type truck equipped with cameras, telescopic
lens and other types of photographic equipment. It has deen used during the past
two years as an investigative asset. The truck is parked about 75 yards fron a
‘target of interest (ususlly a reaidence or apartment building) and the photographer
in the rear of the truck photographs individuals or things of interest to the Station.
LIENTRAP is a valuable asset for any station to have and has enabled this Station to
get pictures of individuals which could have been obtained in no other way. LIEMPTYe-

. > Outline. ~ e mk
, LIJERSEY ~ 1 This is ‘presently an approved project; however, 1t is believed
edvisable for at for administrative efficiency to include the LIJERSEY assets within the I

framework of the LIEMPTY Project. Other . than LILYRIC, which has already been
@iscussed, LIJERSEY consists of a foot surveillance team with three members, LIEMPTYs-~ mel
15, 16 and 17. LIROTY: 5 end'l6 have been euployed for about one and a half years as
end LIEMPTY-17_ for about one year. They have not developed futo as competent a surveil-
lance tesm as the LIPSPICK ted was and probably never vill become as good. The

. LIJERSEY team has been“tised mostly for stationary surveillances and observations of
people of interest. LIEMPTY-17, liowever, has also been used as a pretext investigator.
He bas excelled at this type of work and the Station continues to use him in this
capacity. The Station has been reluctant to use the LIJERSBY team as much ag it
could have been used because of the closé association of the team with GERENDE and,
in turn, GERENDE's knowledge and work: on LIFEAT end the LIPSTICK surveillance team.

- The Station plang to recruit several agents of a type and social level more suitable
for all types of surveillance work than the present LIJERSEY team.

Oliver G. SCANTLING - SCANTLING has been associated with KUBARK for several
yeara in a number of different capacities. He was originally used as a member of
the LIPSTICK surveillance team and later was head of the same team. He has been
used to train new agents in the techniques of surveillance and investigation, to
acquire office space and apartments for the Station's operations and to conduct
investigations and make recruitment approaches to individuals of operational interest
to KUBARK. SCANTLING is currently being used by the Station as an investigator of
LIMESA leads andis atill actively pursuing the LIMESA/MKLIGETING operation.
SVANTLING also maintains regular contact with LIFMPTY-3 and monitors his elicitation
effort against the LICOOL-6 target. In this connection, both SCANTLING and LIEMPTY-3
meet regularly with Doris M. KILLGO for operational guidance. (Note: Please see
the LICOOL Field Project Outline for additional details on LICOOI-6).-

6. Pargets:

Oliver G. SCANTLING - The primary target is,
and personnel. However, SCANTLING devotes most of his time to following wp LIFEAT
ieads which ‘pertain. to services provided the LIMERICK installation by individuals
and firns, G8 construction mgineers, Tloar’y ing firms, safe experts,. turniture
makers, interior decorators, etc.. Ts ‘an éxtent, ‘these are. considered targets of
opportunity it would be impossible to list spécifically what future targets
will be available. Que specific target which SCANTLING ia concerned with is the
occupant of the LICOOL-6 apartment; however, LIEMPTY-3, whom SCANTLING handles,
should more correctly. be given credit for information produced on this target.

Raymond H. GERENDE - LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA all have ag their target
the LIMERICK installation and personnel, plus any local nationals and PBPRIMERS
who visit LIMRRICK, LUENTRAP is concerned with targets of opportunity and fallow.
up investigations on operational leeds obtained from other Station and Headquarters

youla apply to the frequent meetings between the Case Officer and the Principal
Agents; therefore, meetings are clandestine and are wually conducted in the
Case Officer's.car; However, suitable cover stories have been developed between the

Case Officer and SCANILING and between the Case Officer and GERENDE involving back -

information as to how we met and how our friendship developed, to be used

. Ground
in the event ‘tlie. Case Officer ide apprehended with either of the Principal Agents.

“@. Mone of the status cover occupations of any of the LIEMPTY agents 1s
completely compatible with bis operational activities. Action cover stories are
devided upon before cach assignment and devised to complement each agent's status
cover as closely as possible. Base House operators, of course, generally conduct
operational assignments within the confines of their quartera; consequently, the
need for action cover stories is reduced. Appropriate cover stories exist between
GERENDE and the agents in his network and between SCANTLING and LIEMPTY-3.

1. Contact and Commi cation:

Appropriate clandestine communications arrangeszents exist between the various
echelons of LIEMPTY. At the present time these plans. consist of regular and
rapid-non scheduled (emergency) means of contact. GERENDE and SCANTLING are both
in the process of preparing Cetatled written communications plans for their

‘respective agents which include complete regular, alternate and rapid-non

scheduled meeting arrangements. Provistons will dlso be made in these plans for
oral recognition signals and physical bona fides that will enable a person unknown

to the agent to contact him should the need ever arise. The Case Officer is cur-

rently working on a Warning System of Communications which will permit the ex-
peditious exfiltration of GERENDE and SCANTLING fron Mexico should a security
situation arise which would necessitate this.

12. Central and Motivation:

@. Control ~ All LIEMPTY agents are local nationals. GERENDE and SCANTLDN,
doth of whom spent a great deal of their childhood years in PBPRIME and still
have relatives living in PBPRIME, are in many respects more pro-PBPRIME than
many PBPRIME citizens. In the “past, both GERENDE and SCANTLING have evidenced

a high degree of loyalty to Matthew S:; DINGLEY, their former Station Case Officer,
The

over other LIEMPTY agents ia based in part on pre-PBPRIME attitudes and on the
financial remumeration and good handling they received from GERENDE and SCANTLING.
Realistically, control over LIEMPTY agents is based on mutual understandings and
confidence among individuals end should any agent decide to denounce PBPRIME or

_ KUBARK, a8 the case may be, there is not much that the Station could do.

bd. Motivation - With the exception of GERENDE and SCANTLING, whose primary

motivations are ideological, financial compensation seems .to be the b:
motivational factor surrounding LIEMPTY agent ita. © the baste
