7 Agency controlled site in Clinton,

1967, he was’ returned to the Washington

freedom until he was given total free-
dom in April 1969, NOSENKO became a-

RESULTS

* TERMINATION

COMMENTS

Ry memorandum dated 2 October 1968,

the Director of Security forwarded

two reports to the DUCE summarizing

the results of the NOSENKO case to

that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the other by the FBI. .
Both reports conclude that. NOSENKO

" was a bona fide defector. A draft

* memorandum attached to this file,

dated 21 October 1968 and prepared
by the CI Staff, raisés question
regarding NOSENKO's bona fides ©

und challenges the above two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters
germane to his backyround and experience.
Various reports are availubte in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files

‘do document the rationale for the original

ENKO, they do not

confinement of NOS

-document the rationale for his continued

confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated $ August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted |
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in !969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO,

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

was allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.

MEMORANDUN FOR RECORD

, .: SUBJECT: Discussion with Deputy Attorney.

_, General on Nosenko Case

1, Mr elas, Nr. Houston and Nr. Murphy met with
the Deputy Attornoy Goneral and mesbers of his staff to
discuss subject case. Present from Mr. Katranbach's
staff wore Messrs. Foley, Yeagloy aad Reis.

. 2. Mr. Helms oxpiained the Nosenko case briefly
and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considered to be two problems on which we
would like the advice of tha Departzent of Justice.
First, wo would secon feel coapelled to begin hostile

interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth

with respect to his mission for the KGB and ve wondered -

“what the legal posttion would be in circusstances in

_which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pur-

. paso. Second, wo would have to be ready after detorzin-

ing “that we could obtain no additional inforantion fros —
Nosenko to deport. hin... We had thought of taking hin to
Germany and transferring him to Soviet custody in Borlin ~
where this has been done:a number of tines in the past,

"3. There was soso discussion of whether deportation :

to another country aight be a consideration, Nr. Helms

explained we would probably face publicity problems ta
“deporting to a third country of the kind we would en-
counter if hé were free in the U. S. Nr. Helms noted

there wero many items of inforsatiog which we and the

FBI realize are of no significance because of the file
holdings.wo have but which an unscrupulous Newspaper san
could use to create sischiof, This aspect was then dropped
and it was the consensus that 3erlin was probably the bost

place. .

4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foloy to the conditions under
-which Nosanko is in this country. He is here as an “ox
“clusion and parole case" which aeans he bas not been
admitted and has been paroled to the Agency which is
responsible for his while ho is in this country. This

Question #3 - Did McCone or Raborn have any information on this:

Answer:.

Office of Security records contain only limited information
in regard to this question. The SE Division (then SR) was the
responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until late
October-1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the
Office. of Security by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was

Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at hls personally owned’
residence in North Carolina, We is engaged in research and
analytical work based on his previous knowledge of the KGB.

interviews by the FBI and Office of Security personnel.

Question #S - Is he working for CIA?
“Answer?” :

i has been periodically amended to reflect additional remuneration,
primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. In late
197%, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agreement for salary —

on 12 July 1973 Nosenko signed an acknowledgement and release :
of the United States.Government and the Central Intelligence

Agency from any claims prior to that date.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Inspector General

SUBJECT : The Nosenko Case

Attached please find a summary of a document written in
1967 tothe General Counsel outlining the Nosenko case and ~
explaining to him actions which had been taken with regard to
Nosenko. . As noted in the first paragraph, in October 1967

‘ Nosenko took up residence in the Washington area and was

advised that, should he wish to leave the apartment for any
location whatsoever, he was’ {ree to so do. In other words,

“from that date, Nosenko was essentially a totally free man.
“That he chose not to flee in any way may be indicative of his

“attitude towurd the manner in which he was handled prior to —
October 1967. :

While one can criticize the fact that Noscnko was kept
incommunicado for approximately three yeurs, and therefore

presumably denied full civil rights, the attached document
docs indicate, we believe, that the Agency was on the horns

“of a dilemna in this regard. There were legitimate doubts

about. Nosenko's bona fides and concern that he was a Soviet
plant. There. was no Country.to which he could be deported
save the Soviet Union, and Nosenko himself refused to return
there. ‘Yet, in the United States, save when isolated from
society, he was considered to be a continuing threat to
national security.

Recognizing that only legal experts can judge defini-
tively the merits of the case, it seems to the writer that
the Agency had.no choice but to hold Nosenko incommunicado
pending resolution of his bona fides. He was admitted to
the United States under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (§)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, namely as a parolee
to the Agency. As a parolee, Nosenko de facto from the date
of his entry to the United States did not enjoy the full civil
rights of the normal citizen. He was a ward of the Agency, in
a sense, and the Agency was ultimately responsible for his

conduct. There were at the time very legitimate reasons: to
believe that full and total release of Nosenko would be an
_ abrogation by the Agency of its legal responsibility. To
‘gainsay that decision in retrospect is, we believe, an error,
:In sum, ‘the act of defection places the defector at the mercy
of the: laws of the country to which he defects. It is the
obligation of the accepting country to see to it that the
laws are followed. In the Nosenko cuse, it secns to us that
the Agency acted in a fully responsible manner to ensure that
its responsibility for the defector was met. While it was
unfortunate that it took so long to resolve the matter, we
can find no fault with the fact that the Agency met its
responsibility to both the United States and to Nosenko
himself. . :

again in January 1964 as the security officer for the Soviet

disarmament delegation, After a number of mectings with his
CIA handlers “he defected on 4 February. 1964 and was secretly
taken to Frankfurt, Germany, crossing the Swiss-German border
on the night of 4/5 February with alias U.S. Arny identity
documents. In Geneva. and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,
Nosenko wrote out’ an asylum request, requesting political
asylum from the U.S. Government. .

Because serious doubts about Nosenko's bona fides. had

arisen on the basis of the information he had provided both

in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-

inally planned to do a detailed -bona fides debriefing and

assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving

Nosenko to the United States. However, unprecedented action

by the Soviet. Government in respect to the defection of one
of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the
Press that Nosenko, described as an “expert attached to the
Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected,

\
Because of mounting pressure’ ‘from the press, which included
much speculation that Nosenko was a high level scientist or
disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department
would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's
request for asylum in. the U.S. and identifying him'as a
member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February... On 11 Feb-
ruary, the Sovict Government delivered a note to the American
Embassy in Moscow asking how Nosenko left Switzerland and”
requesting an immediate interview with him and his ‘release.
On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-—
ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he
accused-the Swiss Government of failure to fooperate in

locating Nosenko. Although the Swiss categorically rejected

‘these charges, the American Ambassador to Switzerland recom-

mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko
to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of
his own free will. ,

On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director,
Nosenko was brought to the United States. He travelled by
commercial air, again using alias U.S. Army identification, ©
and was admitted to the country.at New York City (in true
name) on parole under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (5)

of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

On 13 February, representatives of the Swiss and Soviet

“Embassies in Washington advised the State Department that

~ they desired interviews with Nosenko. On MW. February, in

Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister GRONYKO called. in- Ambassador

“KOHLER and protested, "impermissable activities" on the part”

of the.U.S, in Nosenko's case. Soviet press spokesmen took

an even harder line to Western correspondents, and accused
the U.S, of kidnapping Nosenko. On the afternoon of 14 Sep-
tember, at two Separate interviews, he spoke first to Swiss

Embassy and then to Sovict Embassy r representatives. At

these interviews, which were also attended by State Department’

and INS- officials, Nosenko confirmed that he left Switzerland

of his own free will’ -to seek asylum in the U. se In addition,

he replied to questions of the Sovict Embassy representative
to the effect that he was renouncing his Soviet citizenship.

On the evening of 14 February, the.U.S. State Department made

a brief formal reply to the Soviet protest, then issued a
brief statement to the press noting that the interviews had
been held and that Nosenko had confirmed his desire to remain
in this country.

From the time of his arrival to 4 April 1964, Nosenko
was housed in the Washington area. During this period, reg-

ular systematic debriefing was’ commenced, and Nosenko was

on mutters affecting their responsibilities. Although allowed

out for evening and week-end excursions, Nosenko was -ut all
times accompanied by O/S personnel. In addition, he took a
two-week vacation to Hawaii, again accompanied by caso offi--
cers and security guards, Evidence continued to mount that
he was a KGB plant, and at the same time it becanic obvious
that it would be impossible to proceed further, to. resolve

the many suspicious points and contradictions -that. had arisen

without changing the conditions in which he was being held.

Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially
when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed’
for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the issuance oe -

of an alien registration card. .At the same time, Noscnko's

heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were causing
increasing difficulties to the security personnel charged with
keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in
accordance with Agency local responsibility. It was clear
that it was only a matter of time before he created a public
scandal. More importantly, he was in a position. to communi-
cate with the KGB since physical control could not be absolute.

investigations. We concluded that it had been established

established contact with CIA, subsequent ly defected on KGB
instructions, and that he came to the United States on a_
deception mission. The implications of this mission had a ~
grave and “direct “bearing on U.S. national security. Although
our findings were supported by the results of two polygraph
examinations, the nature of the evidence was tnadmissable in
a court of law. In any case, it is clear that Nosenko had
not been in a position to perform any overt act of ‘transgres-
sion of U.S. espionage Laws since 4 April 1964 whén he was :

The Secretary of State, Ambassador Thompson, and other,”
senior officials in the Department of State were informed of

Because so much of Nosenko's information affected U.S,
internal security matters for which the FBI bears primary
responsibility, and because the possibility that Nosenko was

F2i operations, the FBI was kept fully informed on our views

sought from him both as to interpretation of the exclusion

event that it proved necessary to deport Nosenko from this

country. .
Efforts to Keep the KGB from Learning of Our Awareness of

Nosenxo'’s True Status

From the time we learned that Nosenko had been sent to
this country on a KGB mission it was obvious that if we were

to have the time to analyze and resolve this case, and to
plan and execute appropriate countermeasures, it was essential

that we attempt to keep the KGB fron. learning of our awareness

_ of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of ‘the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and
the implications thereof, was restricted te a very few people
in the Agency and the. intelligence community. Nonetheless,
we did advise key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-

ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

_visk of leakage.

Soviet Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the. Soviets
were making a serious effort’ to find out what happened to
Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant
and unusual of these was the ‘approach by a Soviet journalist,
Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the French magazine
Paris Match with an offer to provide photographs and materials

for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family. According

to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering an approach to an

zation in an effort to obtain

international juridicial orgai
compensation from Nosenko for: damages caused by his abandon-

ment of her and her children. In responding to this approach
we quoted a statement, purporting to be fror Nosenko himself,

, al

‘SEGRET

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach to repre-
sent blatant and’ cruel manipulation. of his family by the KGB
and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing
to an interview or in any other way.
Nosenko's Status .
To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions
of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act. Parole résponsibility is delegated to the Agency by
the Attorney General under the terms of an agreement executed
by the Attorney General and the [I on 10 February. 1955,
which states:

“After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel- |"

ligence Agency will assume responsibility for

‘care, supervison and control of a kind and

deyree it believes consistent with the internal

security needs of the United States during con-

tinuance of their parole status." :
In accordance with our understanding of this agreement, and
because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious
and willing agent “of a hostile intelligence service, we.
ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

12

States. From 12 February to 4 April 1964 it was possible to
keep Nosenko at a location where he could enjoy a certain
amount of movement and of contact with the outside world.
After 4 April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was
necessary to keep him incommunicado at.a location which is
known to no one outside of the Agency (and to very few within
it). “Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country
under the Special Agreement Procedures was periodically
extended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. a ne ae
Although his freedom of movement had been severely
‘restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and, he made no com- , -
plaint about his treatment. On the contrary, we had several
written statements from him in which he stated that our.
handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal

From the time that Nosenko was brought to this country

we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation
asa contingency measure, In carly 1964, we thought that it
might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda
drawbacks of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenko
has confessed his true KGB role. With the passage of time,
however, and in view of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission and our clearer understanding of what

tors. Forcible repatriation of political refugees is

SECRET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems

stood in the way of his deportation to either the USSR or a

third country.

USSR: Nosenko has categorically stated on numerous

‘ occasions that. he will never contemplate return to the USSR,

and, although we suspect that-he might secretly welcome such.
a move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end
with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,
etc. When the possibility of expulsion was discussed with
Department of State officials in 1964, both the Secretary of
State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for
the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-
against
long established U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse
violent reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United
States. Under. these circumstances an alleged "confession"

by Nosenko would have come under very close scrutiny, and

“might have backfired very badly. Another point that had to

be considered was the possibility that the Sovicts, again |

playing their part, might have refused to accept Noscnko on

the grounds that he has renounced his Soviet citizenship.
‘Third Country: Although we believed it likely that

Nosenko would accede to deportation to a third country,

there is certainly no country in the free world on which we

The strict conditions of NOSENKO'S confinement were
intended to convey. to him the seriousness of his position
as a suspected disinformation agent and to make clear to hin that
his free settlement in the U.S. was precluded as long as
this issue was unresolved. It was understood, however,
that at any time he could have elected to end his cenfine-
ment and return to the Soviet Union. OS files do not document
that this latter condition was explicitly conveyed to
NOSENKO, however, it is the recollection of senior staff
officers (ADD/O and D/OS) that such was the case, and further
that it was a condition routinely applied to other defectors

whose bona fides were in doubt.

whether the following case is identical to the referenced
case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts
appear to be quite similar,

4. Information developed by this Office of possible in-
terest to the Inspector General, pertains to one John Torpats,
an ex-CIA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

5.- Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926. Torpats was employed by
CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961. . The
file information reflected that in July 1956, Torpats was found
guilty of mistreatment of an alien by a Special Inquiry Board

in Frankfurt, -West Germany. The alicn involved was Eduard ‘
Oun, an Estonian who defected from Estonia through Sweden :
in 1955,

fo, 6. The incident in Frankfurt involved bistreatment of
‘ ‘Oun during interrogations directed by Torpats. The charges
‘ - of physical abuse included the striking of Oun with the fist;

the body, the scrubbing of Qun's body with a brush, and fo

9. The Office of Security file of Eduard Oun contained
little information other than interrogation reports dated 1956.
It was not clear from file information whether Oun entered the
United States after the Frankfurt incident. The most recent
document contained in the Oun file was dated 17 September
1956 and noted that Oun had been psychiatrically examined and
found qualified for Agency sponsored immigration to the U.S,

‘ Hl. Sovict visas and other regulations for tourists traveling to the USSR,

L 1. Didn't you know or remember how: Oswald's visa-was Processed and

~ trom what country Oswald. entered the USSR? Ia it possible that he.

entered the USSR on a “podvisnaya" visa?

UY 2. You previously said that you saw Oswald's visa application, but you could

not say from | what country Oswald came to the USSR. In your opinion, is

it_possible. that Oswald received his visa ‘application In some other European ~ Me

country, then went to Finland and through Finland entered the USSR without
contacting the Sovict consulate in Helsinki? Did you hear any talk about the

Po possibility that is described above? If so, when did you hear it and from

whom?
: UV 3. On 3 July 1964 you stated that you have seen Oswald's anketa (visa
: application). Do you remember what was in that anketa? Did you read

the anketa? What did yeu. mean that. you saw the anketa? Was it in the

vitzerland or Sweden

obtain his visa’ Could he have QUtained a ving in
a
tien nave come to deisinki and, without reporting to the Soviet conaulate
in Helsinki, have taken a train to Leningrad and then to Moscow?-

vs According te your previous information, Many tourist - he buys a tour

to the Soviet Union, makes out the anketa, and then comes to Moscow,"

In what country did Ouwald buy a tour to the USSR? In what country did

Oswald fill in the anketa? If the ankela goes to Moscow, to what office

in Moscow does it go? To MID, KGI8? Is it possible that all the data on
Oswald from his anketa was sent to Moscow by a cable? ‘Did you sce and

read Oswald's anketa ora a tetogeam that ‘Oswald is coming to Moscow?

Tf you did not read the anketa, who arnong the KGB officers of the Second

Chief Directorate or the First Chief Directorate read the anketa or had

access to it? Who would logically have access to tho anketa?

-6. According to your previous information, any person who wants to visit the

USSR has to buy a tour.ina forcign tourist firm in his home country or any

other country, and the touriat firm’ will make | arrangements for hia ‘at Ly”

the USSR. It is understood that he must fill in the. anketa, and in addition to -

the general questions, the common tourist should make requests for the

celtics he intends to visit and for the accommodations he wants, The tourist

would know i in advance when he r receives his visa his date of arrival in
nm

Moscow, in what hotel he is going to stay, and what kind of accommodations Soe

he would be given. The queation, then, is do you know when Intourist

received Oswald's request’and application and when. it answered him that

his demands are met and that he is welcome {n Moscow?

/ 7 From your knowledge, when Oswald arrived in Moscow, was he handled by

the Intourist Agency or by Sputnik, the Youth Tourist Bureau of the USSR,

‘or hy the Central Council for Tourism of the Soviet Trade Unions? °
Note: The Centrat Council far Tourism of the’ Soviet Trade Unions organizes
exchanges of tourists between trade unions of the USSR and other
} countries. Sputnik was organized in June 1958 for the exchange of.
, of tourists (students and other youths), -

” : .

eR, What is the procedure after a touriat applies for a Soviet viru? Do you
know at what touriat agency or in what forcign country Oswald applied |.
for a visa to the USSR or bought a toue to the USS? Who was the
Sovict Intourist representative in Uhat country who took Oswald's visa
application to the Soviet Embassy?

Yo You stated previously that Oswald wan not considered a defector. If he

was nota defector, then what was he?

Note: If the KGB did not consider Oswald to be a defector, then it is
. | possible that Oswald was known to the KGB long before his arrival
; in the USSR as a tourist and Oswald was assured that when he
—_ : arrived in the USSR he would be given Soviet citizenship or at...
least a permanent residence permit. Although he would be a defector
anyway, ft could be that Oswald did not like the word defector
‘and the KGB decided not to call him a defector but, let us say, a
volunteer, The Soviet-Constitution states that the USSR grants the
“right of asylum to all foreign citizens "who are persecuted for —
“safeguarding the interests of the working class or who are persecuted
for scientific activities, for national-liberation struggle." (Article
129 of the USSR Constitution of 1936.) .

JY 10. You stated previously that "since about 1960, every Sovict ambassader----
: . can give a visa in thrae to five days. If so, what was so special for the

Soviet government that the ambassador would be personally involved in

issuing a visa to

It is known ‘that in 1957. the Soviet government adopted some measures  ,
to irrprove travel for foreign tourists in the USSR. They rnostly :
concerned currency exchange. The 1957 regulations said nothing
about visas, Nogenko should be questioned about the 1957 decision
of the Soviet government to determine if he {s not mistaking the 1957
decision with that of 1960, .

11. You stated: previously. that since about 1960, every Soviet ambassador © _ am S cok

ean give vieas.in from throe to five days, The available information

published by the Soviets unmistakenly states that a visa cannot be obtained *-
in less than'seven days (in some cases it takes five to seven days). Following

in Moscow in 1969, and from the magazine Soviet Life, May 1978, p- 59.

2.- What do you know about Alcksandr Nikiforovich Aksenev?

f. Note; (a) Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of the KGB of Belorussia

| cs from 1959 to 1960, It is assumed that when Oswald arrived

‘in Minsk in January 1960, Aksenov was Deputy Chairman of -

‘of the KGB and would definitely know about the Oswald case.
From 1960 to 1965, Aksenov was MVD Minister of Belorussia, -
Therefore it would be under his direction that Oswald's passport
and the departure of Oswald and Marina from Minsk was
arranged, If Nosenko had access to Oswald's file, he must .
know about Aksenov, From 1965 tu 1971, Aksenov was First
Secretary of the Vitebsk Obkom of CP Belorussia, and since
1971, Aksenov has been Second Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Belorussian CP. He has been a member of
the CC CPSU since 1976, and he is also a deputy to the USSR
Supreme.Soviet. On May 9, 1978, Aksenov arrived in Columbia,
He headed the Soviet delegation on the invitation of the Columbian

Communist Party.

(hy) ALN. Akcenoy is no doubt identical with a Colonel Nikolay
Aksenov with whom, according to -Epstein's hook, (page 146)
Marina Oswald had an interview in 1961, Aksenoy is alsa
roentioned in MeMillan's book (pages 132-133). Aksenoy
allegedly said to Marina, "Tell your husband not.to worry... I
believe your request wilBbe granted." Also see page 125 of

the same book,

Did you know or know of Avkadiy Denisovich Rudak?
: Tae
Note: Rudak was Deputy Chairman of the KGB during 1959 to 1960 and
might have taken part in the Oswald case while Oswald lived

‘in Minsk,

4. - Did you know or know of Major General Stepan Aleksecyevich Smorodinskiy?

Note: Smorodinskiy was Deputy Chairman of the KGB for Helorussia in
~" 1962 and most likely know about the Oswald case, His name
would most likely appear in the Oswald file. :

e. Do ‘you ‘know Lt, General Vasiliy Ivanovich Petrov? -

Note: Petrov was KGB Chairman for Belorussia from 1959 to 1973,
Therefore, it would be his agency, the KGB, which would watch
Oswald in Minsk. It is.safe to assume that after the assassination
of President Kennedy in 1963, Petrov, as Chairman of the KGB

‘of Belorussia, would review the Oswald file and eend it to Moscaw,
He would also have been called to Moscow KGB headquarters to
take part in the Preparation of the spravka (summary) of the

Oswald file,

y 6. What do you know about Lt. General Aleksandr Ivanovich Perepelitsyn?

Note: Perepelitsyn was Chairman of the KGB of the Beloriissian Republic’. .
from 1954 to 1959, Nosénko should know him or af léaat about him. .
Nosenko should be asked ‘if Perepelitsyn took any part in the
‘investigation of Oswald. (Perepelitsyn was Deputy Chairman of
the KGB of the USSR from 1959 to 1967. He. died in ‘Moscow, )

y 7. What part, if any, was played by General Sergey Grigor yevich Bannikov

‘in the Oswald case, especially after the assassination of. President Kennedy? «.

Bannikov was mentioned by Nosenko as one of the Deputy Chiefs of
the Second Chief Directorate and later on as one of the Deputy
Chairmen of the KGB of the-USSR, From 1968 to 1978, Bannikoy
was Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Supreme Court.

Note:*

1. Can you explain why you went to England and Cuba under the name Nikolayev
and to Geneva using your true name, Nosenko? What would kave happened
if some Englishman or English intelligence officer had met you in Geneva

in 1962 or in 1964 and grected you in the presence of the other delegates

From where did you learn that the GRU was not informed about Oswald's
presence in the USSR? Wouldn't the GRU officer in Intourist, whom you

lier, have known about Oswald's presence in the USSR?

mentioned ¢

Did you eve hear that Oswald possibly had contact with the Soviet
intelligence during his service in Japan? .

You stated previously that there was no information that Oswald offered
to give information on the US Marine Corps. You did not read the file,
Then how do you know this to be the case? How do you know that the KGB

and GRU made no attempt to debricf Oswald about his service in the.

US Marine Corps? ,

Previously. you mentioned one Colonel Voloshin as an officer of the
Defense Ministry of the USSR. Can you provide any additional information

on this Voloshin? Could it be possible that he was a KGB officer instead :

' .of-in'the Defense*Ministry?.

toh

Note: (a) Accowding to Epstein's book, one Pavel T, Voloshin was an
administrator at Patrice Lumumba University and was a KGB
officer who accompanied a group of Russian dancers to Los Angeles
in 1959 at just about the same time that Oswald was making
weekend trips there to get his passport and possibly to make other

. arrangements for: his ‘trip to Moscow, A few weeks after Oswald
decided to return to the United States, he received a letter from
Patrice Lumumba University Signed by Voloshin. (page 111) :
{b) -P, D. knew one KGB officer by the name of Voloshin (first
and middle name forgotten) who used to work in SMERSH
(military Cl) and later in the late 1940's and beginning of the
1950's inS & T Department of the KGB, oo

VU. Marina,

From where did you pick up the information that Marina was. a “simple.

Sbyvatel" (a politically unaware Person) and that she was not anti-Soviet

if you did not read the Oswald file?

2. You stated previously that Macina was an obyvatel, Do you have any

comments on the following: "We knew cach time you had a date, We :
knew when you applied for younunarriage license, | We knew the date of
your wedding." These were the words of the Komsomol socrenacy in

Minsk when Marina was expelled from the Komsomol,
~" 3. Do you have any comments on Marina's statement when she said,
"Our government (Soviet) knows every move I make." She make this
comment shortly after her expulsion from the Komsomol,
~ 4 Did you know that while in Minsk Marina belonged to a group of youths

who gathered together to listen to Voice of America and BBC? Would

that be enough for the KGB to have Marina in its card files? Is it
possible that Marina was the KGB agent reporting on them?
v 5. You stated that if Marina had been recruited by the KGB, you would
know about it and it would be in the file, But you did not read the file.
How then do you know that she was not recruited?
You said that among Marina's relatives there was an officer of the Minsk

Militia, a Lt. Colonel, Do -you have any comments on Marina's

revelation that her: real father Was a traitor and that he was shot? Ie’

her father was a traitor and fie « was shot, would his name be in the KGB

card file? Would the name of Marina's mother be in the KGB card file

as the wife of a traitor? Is it then possible that Marina's name also

would be 1 in the. KGB. card file somewhere?

. . Py

“yy 7 You stated préviously that KGB had no interest in Marina prior to her
meeting Oswald and that the KGB investigated her only after Oswald

applied for permission to register marriage with Marina, How do you

know that? Did you read a special file on Marina? Marina revealed

lately that while she was living in Leningrad in 1958 or 1959, she met

a diplomat from Afghanistan who lured her to his hotel room and tried

to make love to her.- Do you think the KGB in Leningrad would know

about this diplomat and whom he lured to hid hotel? Is it possible that
.

Marina was already a RGD agent and she was directed to lure the

In either care, the KGB would definitely know

diplomat ta the hotel?
about Marina and if ache was used hy the KGB as a bait for foreigners,
might she have already becn an experienced KGB agent?

You stated previously that you saw Oswald's file only briefly and you

tead only a summary. Then how would you know that Marina Wes novor:

used by.the KGB? Did you personally make a direct check on whether or:

“not Marina way’ a KGB informant?

In your previous testimony, you categorically denied that Marina was a
KGB-MVD agent or informer. Do you have any comments on Marina's

statement to Life Magazino that she was a "Soviet agent"? Is there any

Marina had lived previously, had recruited her as an agent or informor
and she continued to work for the KGB or the MVD until her departuro to
the US? Did you have any fifermation about the possibility that there was
another file in the KGB on Marina, a file for an agent or informer of the

KGB or MVD? If such a file existed, it must be reflected in the Oswald.

Did you hear or + know that white in Leningrad Marina dated one Oleg”

What do you know about Marina's vacation in Kharkov shortly after

she married Oswald?

Note: She may have been in Moscow instead of Kharkov.

Did you know that while in Minsk Oswald was in the Fourth Clinical
Hospital for surgery on his adenoids? (Oswald got special attention from

the doctors.) \

Oswald studying at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, It
also should be noted that Shirokova visited Minsk shortly after
Oswald and his wife Marina decided to go to the United States,

could you make sacha statement you did not ead the file? You were

according to your information, you did not
visit Minsk to study the Oswatd cure,

not re sponsible f for i, and,

Note: Oswald's diary clearly shows that most of the students he met were
most Hkely not students at all, They were more likely KGI officers

under cover as students,

and opened the vase file on Oswald, which was later sent to Minsk,
Name other officers who participated in making the ‘decision to.open -

part did you personally play in Oswald's case while Oswald was in Moscow?
: 14. You stated previously that the Secand Chiet’ Directorate of the KGB was,
not interest in Oswald because it was concerned only with internal .
mattera," Isn't it true that the Second Chief Directorate is the internal
counterintelligence organization and is responsible for foreigners who

; enter the Sovict Union for any reason? Isn't it true that the tourist

department of the Second Chief Directorate is responsible for foreign:

tourists such as. ‘Oowala? Then why wasn't: the Second Chiet Directorate :
interested i in Oswald? ‘Do you see any contradictions in your statement?

i v 15. You stated that there was no 0 attempt made to exploit Oswata for

propaganda purposes, such : as Radio, Moscow ‘ broadcasts, TV, lectures,

etc, How do you know this? Do you have any comments on the following:

Hotel Berlin by a correspondent of Radio Moscow, Lev Setyayev, who

In it your opinion that the Second ‘Chief Directorate was not interested to

find out why Onwald talked to these newepapermen and who they were?

Isn't that part of the KGi'ns responsibilities?
18, According to your statement, Oswald was not connidered normal, Who
determined that he wan nest normal? How many doctors, from what
institutions, concluded that Oswald was not normal? The Second Chiot
Directorate and Intourist officers could not conclude that Oswald was
abnormal without medical expertise,

19, If Oswald was abnormal, then why did Sovict authorities, for example,

v
the Ministry of Forcign Affairs, not inform the American Embansy about
it?

Note: In hie previous interrogation, Noscnko hesitated in answering these
questions,
. tv 20. You stated previously that Oswald was in the hoopital,. the hospital said

that Oswald was not normal, and there was no action taken to inform the

. American Embassy. How do you know all of thie without reading the’
Oswald file?

if he had been turned over to them? Do you know that any Sovict :
government office contacted the American Embassy and informed. them

What would happen if the MVD issued a statelena passport without
KGB knowledge or ifthe KGB was apaingt it? ~
You stated previously that the KGB considered Oswald to have retained

his American citizenship while he was in the Soviet Union, Do you have

any comments on the fact that after his arrival in the USSR, and after
having made oral requests for Savict citizenship, he returned to the

American Embassy, denounced his US citizenship and threw. out his .
American passport to the American Coneul at the Embassy, :

Do you think the KGB monitored Oswald's conversations with the .
American Consulate officers ‘or received reports from the American
Embassy (from Soviet employees there or Soviet agents there) about
Oswald's denunciation of US citizenship? Did the KGB instruct Oswald
to denounce his American citizenship at the American Embassy before
he would be permitted to apply for Soviet citizenship?

You stated that the decision to’ give Oswald a stipend. wae mado by the
Red Cross. Explain in detail how the Red Cross learned that Oswald
arrived inthe USSR. Who informed the Red Cross that there was an
American who needed help? Why was it decided to give help ‘from the
Red Cross and not from the Trade Union? It 1s. understandable that
Oswald might not have had enough money to start a new life in the USSR,
but he was not a poor beggar who needed to be turned to the Red Cross
instead of the Trade Union. ‘How did you find out that it was the Red Cross
that made the decision? According to available information, the Red
Cross does not assign money to anybody without the recommendation of
some other Soviet office, Which office was its the KGB, MVD, the

Councit of Ministers, Intourist, or the USSR Supreme Soviet? Who

Belorussia, the “marriage cannot be permilted between persons

You stated previously that Oswald's file wae sent to the Second Directorate

of the Belorussian KGB. Haw do you know that it was sent specifically

to the Second Directorate and not to the KGB chairman or his deputy -

other American defector, “. ... The only difference was that he was not:”

to be allowed to stay, and he was considered to be abnormal." If this was .
the only difference, and it is quite a big one, then why was he allowed to

stay in the USSR? If Oswald was “not normal" according to the KGB

dom in April 1969. NOSENKO became a
U.S. citizen in April 1974, SOSENKO
was employed by the Agency, as a
consultant in March 1969 and continues
under contract to date. His present
salary is $23,500 per year. :

BACKGROUND:

(1) The legal basis to confine NOSESKO
against his will was discussed by

Mr. Richard Helms, DD/P, and others with
the Deputy Attorney General on 2 April
1964 (Tab 1). On 3 April 1964, the
Agency General Counsel, Mr. Lawrence
Houston, advised the Director of Security
by memorandum that such confinement was
proper (Tab 2).

APPROVAL

(2) There are a series of letters fron
the PPCI, DCI and others to various
agencies, including the Department of
Justice and the White House, covering
the period 1964 to 1969, evidencing
awareness of these agencies of the
NOSENKO affair (Tab 3).

(3) The conditions of NOSENKO's conf ine-
ment were established by the Office of
Security (Tabs 4 @ 5).

RESULTS

TERMINATION

COMMENTS

Ky memorandum dated 2 October 1968,
the Director of Security forwarded
two reports to the DDCI summarizing
the results of the SOSENKO case to
that date. The reports are voluminous.
One was prepared by the Office of
Security and the vther by the FBI. |.
Both reports conclude that NOSENKO
was a bona fide defector. A draft
memorandum attached to this file,
dated 21 October 1968 and prepared

by the CI Staff, raises question
regarding NOSENKO's bona Cides

und challenges the above two reports.

NOSENKO continues under contract to

the Agency. He is brought to Washington
periodically to consult on matters
germane to his background and experience.
Various reports are available in the
files of the Office of Security which
detail financial aspects of this case.

No final accounting has been made since
the project continues.

(1) While the Office of Security files
do document the rationale for the original
confinement of NOSENKO, they do not

document the rationale for his continued

confinement over so long a period of time.
A memorandum dated S August 1969 states
that various congressional staff officers: ~
were briefed on NOSENKO and states that
concern for his safety, as well as con-
cern regarding his bona fides, prompted |
the prolonged confinement. (See Tab 6)

(2) Office of Security files document
a period in 1969 during which a mail
cover was placed on NOSENKO.

(3) During the above period, NOSENKO

wis allowed a pleasure trip to Florida.
During this trip, Agency personnel, with
apparent Headquarters approval, obtained
the services of prostitutes. This
apparently occurred on at least two
occasions.

MEMORANDUM FOR: RECORD

SUBJECT: - Discussion with Deputy Attorney
General on Nosenko Case

> J, Me Helms, Nr. Houston and Nr. Murphy mot with
the Deputy Attorney Goneral and nesbers of his staff to
discuss subject caso. Present frea Hr, Katzenbach's
staff were Messrs. Foloy, Yeagley and Rois. .

2.. Mr. Holms oxplained the Nosenko case briefly
and indicated that shortly we would be faced with what
we at least considored to be two probleas on which we
would like the advice of the Departaent of Justice.

‘First, wo would sooon feel coapelled to begin hostile

interrogation of Nosenko in order to arrive at the truth
with respect to his mission for the KG3 and wo wondored
what the legal position would be in circusstances in

‘ which we detained Nosenko against his will for this pure

pose. Second, wo would have to be ready after detorsin-
ing ‘that we could obtain no additional infornation fros
Nosenko to doport hin... We had thought of taking hin to
Germany and transferring him to Soviet custody in Borlin
where this has been done a number of tines in the past.

3. There was soso discussion of. whether deportation _

to another country night be a consideration. Nr. Helms

explained we would probably face publicity probleas in
deporting to a third country of the kind we would en-
counter if he were freo in the U. S. Nr. Helss noted

there were many itons of .inforsation which we and the

FBI realizo are of no significance because of the file
holdings.we have but which an unscrupulous newspaper nan
could use to create nischiof, This aspect was then dropped
and it was the consensus that 35eriin was probably the best

place.

4. The question of the basis for detention was again
raised and related by Mr. Foloy to the conditions under
which Nosenko is in this country. ife is here as an “oxe-
clusion and parole case" which seans he has not been
adnitted and has been parolod to tha Agsacy which is
Tesponsible for hin while he is in this ccuatry. . This

14-00000

parole can be interpreted to moan parole to a specific
locale which would provide sone justification for our.
detaining hia for questioning. It was then pointed out,
however, that 1f he said ho wished to loave the country
to return to. the. Soviet Union, technically we would not
bo able to detain hin further. In this event, we would
bo" faced with the need to deport him quickly and quiotiy
_ and for this purpose. the innigration warrant of arrest
“and deportation was probably the bost instrument, —

Se. Mr. Katzenbach askod Hr. Foley to check into
this and Mr. Foley will in turn contact Nr. Houston.
Mr. Houston will in turn discuss the problem with CIA
Office of Security officials to get the background of
their liaison with the INS oa these watters,

oe 6. Mr. Helus thanked Mr. “Xatzenbach for his assistance
and wo departed amid some. jovial bantor with respect to
"The Spy Who Case in From the Cold" about what we expected
fo happen to him when he started to clinb aver that “wall”
n Berlin. - . .

MEMORANDUM FOR: : Director of Security

SUBJECT: "Parole Status of Defectors

“7 1, ‘On 2 April 1964 we had a discussion with the Department -
. of Justice om the status of aliens whose inspection by I&NS is deferred
upon arrival at our request and who are then parolad to this Agency, ~
dk was the position of the Department of Justice that we were responsible

. _ for taking any action necessary to carry out the terms of the parole,

* * 2. As you know, a basic parole agreement was executed by the +}
‘Attorney General and the DCI on 10 February 1955, After setting up
- conditions for authorizing parole in any one case, the agreement states: .
. _ "After parole of such aliens, the Central Intelligence Agency will assume * .
1. Fesponsibility for care, supervision and control of a kind and degree it nn)

believes consistent with the internal ‘Security needs of the United States” - wR
during continuance of their parole status. This means that the :

responsible Agency officials must take the minimum action necessary

sto protect the internal security needs of the United States. The word :
i "minimum" is not necessarily a limitation, It merely means that good -
‘ : judgment must be used as to what kind and degree of action is necessary,”

A

3. The agreement further provides that upon completion of the :
Parolee's intelligence or operational purposes in the United States or if , i
internal security reasons so require, the alien will be removed from .
this country through arrangements made by the Agency and, in such’ .
case, the Agency will inform the Service in advance of each proposed

departure, . 4

3. Nosenko had buen a KGB officer for approximately ten years

+. atthe time of his defection. Nosenko has provided a large quantity of

counter-intelligence data and a Limited amount of positive intelligence.

| For exampie, one of his reporte played a part in the negation of a major

hostile penetration in Groat Britain. Whero appropriate, ‘his information: |

‘uas been shared with the FBI, other U.S. Government agencies and .
. :
fordign Laison services. This has resulted in extensive and continuing

investigative activity. In addition, Noseako identified many hundreds of

Soviet Intelligence Officers and provided a considerable quantity of useful”

information on the organization of tae KGB, ite operational doctrine and

“ita techniques and methods.

- te lg. In debriefing him it became apparent that Nosenko tho privileged

_ waa a particularly complex persénality, one given to exaggeration of h
importance. In this regard, certain aspects of hie life history, when .

weighed against other information already in our possession, raised some

doubts concerning hia veracity. To permit extensive and prolonged debriefing,

arrangements were made to accommodate Nosenko under highly secure

conditions, These arrangements were dictated, during the initial phases
at least, by the additional need to provide Noseako with continuing personal

protection since there was the distinct possibility that, as a NGB officer, ~~~

he would be targetted for “executive action" if the Soviets should discover

hie whoreabduts: VWiik bie Pascage of time, thin latter facto? is considored
to be sufficiently diminished to justify a phased normalization of Nosenko's

situation--this despite the fact that-somo points remaia unresolved concerning

hie bona fides.

5. The Agency, with the assistance of the FBI, is continuing to.
. ,
look into those questionable aspects of the case, while remaining alert to

the possibility of hostile interest, However, during the full period of his .

vatay in the United States Noserko has cooperated with hia interrogators and

with the other. officara-reszonsibla for his asfety and welfare, ant, our

; ‘current efforte are being directed toward his gradual adjustment to a normal, .

independent otatus. Ags a step in this direction, he is now living in his own

‘private apartmont, subject to some protective surveillance.

a 6. “This action is being taken in full recognition of the normal
problems of readjustment experienced by many defectors as well as the
fact that Nosenko ie a potentially greater problem than most. He is an
individual whose actions during resettlement may not always be predictable
or wise from the point of view of his own security. We are hopetul that
Nosanko ia sensidle enouga to realize that undue publicity caused by any rasa
action on hia. part couid lead to unpleasant, perhaps even dangerous consequences,

particularly for himself. ‘We therefore believe it appropriate to taxe this

calculated ziek in an atten: to steer him toward a reasonabiy normal Lite.

Question #L - Conditions under which Nosenko was held while at.
Clinton? Locked in? Let outside for entertainment?

Prisoner? Treatment?

Answer:

. During the period of 4 April 1964-13 August 1965, Nosenko
was held in strict confinement under the following conditions: |

a. Confinement in single room except for
periods of interrogation.

b. Constantly under guard and subject to 24 hour
visual observation with regular room search.

c. Dress was coveralls and food was of sufficient

d. No unnecessary conversation was permitted, radio
and television were not allowed, newspapers or
any information concerning current events were
forbidden and reading material was extremely

conditons cited above were basically maintained with th
following additons or changes:

a. From February 1966 to May 1967, Nosenko was’ “o !
furnished no reading material. . \

b. After May 1967, Nosenko was periodically given

eur.

14-00000

Question 43 - nid McCone or Raborn have any information on this:
What?

Answer:

Office of Security records contain only limited information
in regard to this question. The SE Division (then SR) was the
responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until late
October 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the
Office of Security by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was
at leust generally aware of the confinement of Noscnko and the

' - conditions of confinement, but any definite statement must be

based on SE records.

Question #4 - Where is Nosenko working now?

’ Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at his personally owned
residence in North Carolina. He is cngaged in research and
analytical work based on his previous knowledge of the KGB
and other Soviet matters. He is in the Washington, D. C. area
for several days approximately every six weeks for direct
interviews by the FBI.and Office of Security personnel.

Question #5 - Is he working for CIA?

Answer:

Nosenko has been employed by the Agency on a full-time
contractual basis since 1 March 1969. The original contract
has been periodically amended to reflect additional remuneration
primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. ...In,.late
1974, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agreement for salary
not received during the 1 April 1964 to 1 Murch 1969. In addition, :
on 12 July 1973 Nosenko signed an acknowledgement and release :
of the United States Government and the Central Intelligence
Agency from any claims prior to that date.

Question #6 - What is his legal status?

Answer:

Nosenko was naturalized as a United States citizen in
April 1974.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Inspector General

SUBJICT : The Nosenko Case

Attached please find a summary of a document written in
1967 to:the General Counsel outlining the hosenko case and
explaining to him actions-which had been taken with regard to...
Nosenko. As noted in the first paragraph, in October 1967
‘Nosenko took up residence ‘in the Washington area and was
advised that, should he wish to leave the apartment for any
location whatsoever, he was free to so do. In other words,
om that date, Nosenko was essentially a totally free man.
hat he chose not to flee in any way may be indicative of his
attitude toward the manner in which he was handled prior to
October 1967.

While one can criticize the fact that Nosenko was kept
incommunicado for approximately three years, and therefore
presumably denied full civil rights, the attached document
does indicate, we believe, that the Agency was on the horns
of a dilemna in this regard. There were lIcgitimate doubts
about. Nosenko's bona fides and concern that he was a Soviet
plant. There. was no Country to which he could be deported
save the Soviet Union, and Nosenko himself refused to return
there. Yet, in the United States, save when isolated from
society, he was considered to be a continuing threat -to ae
national security.’ . : mo :

Recognizing that only legal experts can judge defini-

. tively the merits of the case, it seems to the writer that

’ the Agency had no choice but to hold ‘Nosenko, incommunicado
pending resolution of his bona fides. He was admitted to
the United States under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (S)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, namely as a parolee
to the Agency. As a parolee, Nosenko de facto from the date
of his entry to the United States did not enjoy the full civil
rights of the normal citizen. He was a ward of the Agency, in
a sense, and the Agency was ultimately responsible for his

conduct. There were at the time very legitimate reasons .to
believe that full and total release of Nosenko would be an
al responsibility. To

gainsay that decision in retrospect is, we believe, an crror.

.In sum, the act of defection places the-defector at the mercy

of the laws of the country to which he defects. It is,th
Obligation of the accepting country to see to it that tl
laws are followed. In the Nosenko cause, it seems to us thit
the Agency acted in a fully responsible manner to ensure that’
its responsibility for the defector was met. While it was
unfortunate that it taok so long to resolve the matter, we
can find no fault with the fact that the Agency met its
responsibility to both the United States and to Nosenko

himself,

cr

sought an advisory opinion from the General Counsel on the

Agency's legal basis for its handling of Nosenko through

that date and on the legal aspects on the eventual disposi-

tion of Nosenko. Shortly subsequent to this sexorandum to

the General Counsel, Nosenko took up residence in October 1967
in an apartment in the Washington area and was reminded that
should he wish, he could travel freely anywhere at anytime.

He gradually created a new life for himself in the United

States and has indicated on several occasions that he holds

no ill feeling about his handling by the Agency at anytime.

Background

Nosenko voluntarily established contact with CIA repre-

sentatives in Geneva in 1962. He identified hinself as a

staff officer of the KGB's internal security directorate and
offered to sell counterintelligence information. This offer

was accepted and he was recruited as an agent in place and

disarmament delegation. After a number of mectings witn his
CIA handlers he defected on 4 February 1964 and was secretly
taken to Frankfurt, Germany, Crossing the Swiss-German border™~
on the night of 4/5 February with alias U.S. Army identity

documents. In G¢ 1.and again upon arrival in Frankfurt,

Nosenko wrote out’ an asylum request, requesting political
asylum from the U.S. Government. ,

Because serious doubts about Nosenko's bona fides had
arisen on the basis of the information he had provided both
in 1962 and in the meetings in Geneva in 1964, it was orig-
inally planned to do a detailed bona fides debricfing and
assessment in Germany before making any decision about moving -

Nosenko to the United States. However, unprecedented action

bythe Soviet Government in respect to the defection of one

of its citizens forced a change of plans. On 9 February,

unidentified Soviet sources in Geneva leaked the news to the
Press that Nosenko, described as an “expert attached to the
Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference" had dis-

appeared, and that it was presumed that he had defected.

Because of mounting pressure’ fron the press, which included
much speculation that Hosenko was a high level scientist or

disarmament expert, it was decided that the State Department

would make a brief announcement acknowledging Nosenko's
request for asylum in. the U.S. and identifying him as a

member of the KGB. This was done on 10 February. On 11 Feb-

ruary, the Sovict Government delivered a note to.the American

Embassy in Moscow usking how Nosenko left Switzerland and
requesting an immediate interview with him and his release.
On 12 February, Soviet Ambassador to the Disarmament Confer-
ence TSARAPKIN held a press conference in Geneva in which he
accused the Swiss Government of failure to cooperate in
locating Nosenko, Although the Swiss categorically rejected
these charges, the American Ambassador to Switzerland recom-
mended that Swiss authorities be allowed to interview Nosenko.::
to convince themselves that Nosenko had left Switzerland of
his own free will. ; ,
On 12 February 1964, on the instructions of the Director)
Nosenko was brought to the United States. He travelled by
commercial air, again using alias U.S. Army identification,
and was admitted to the country. at New York City (in true

name) on parole under the provisions of Section 212 (d) (5)

of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

SECSET :

On 13 February, representatives of the Swiss and Soviet
Embassies in Washington advised the State Departifent that
they desired interviews with Nosenko. Gn 14. February, ‘in
Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO called in Ambassador

KOHLER and protested “impermissable activities" on the part

of the U.S. in Nosenko's case, Soviet press spokesmen took
an even harder line to Western correspondents, and accused
the U.S. of kidnapping Nosenko. On the afternoon of 14 Sep-
tember, at two separate interviews, he spoke first to Swiss
Embassy and then to Sovict Embassy representatives. At

these interviews, which were also attended by State Department
and INS officials, Nosenko confirmed that he left Switzerland
of his own free will to seek asylum in the U.S. In addition,

he replied to questions of the Sovict Embassy representative

to the effect that he was renouncing his Soviet citizenship

On the evening of 14 February, the.U.S. State Department made

a brief formal reply to the Soviet protest, then issued a
brief statement to the press noting that the interviews had
been held and that Nosenko had confirmed his desire to remain
in this country.

From the time of his arrival to 4 April 1964, Nosenko
was housed in the Washington. area, During this period, reg-

ular systematic debriefing was commenced, and Nosenko was

made available to representatives of the FBT for debricfing

on matters affecting their responsibilities. Although allowed

out for evening and week-end excursions, Nosenko was at all

times accompanied by 0/S personnel. In addition, he took.
two-week vacation to Hawaii, again accompanied by cuse offi-

cers and security guards. Evidence continued to moint that

he was a KGB plant, and at the same time it became obvious”
that it would be impossible to proceed_further, to. resolve

the many suspicious points and contradictions that had arisen
without changing the conditions in which he was’ being held.
Nosenko was growing increasingly uncooperative, especially

when sensitive areas were touched upon, and constantly pressed”
for the legalization of his status in the U.S. and the issuance

of an alien registration card, At the same time, Nosenko's

heavy drinking and other unruly personal habits were causing -

increasing difficulties to the security personnel charged

keeping him under control and out of trouble at all times in

accordance with Agency local responsibility. It was clear

that it was only a matter of time b before he created a public

scandal. More importantly, he was in a position. to communi-

cate with the KGB since physical control could nut be absolute.
On 4 April 1964, Nosenko voluntarily underwent a polygraph

examination. The results of this examination indicated deception

en a number of critical points indicating that he was sent

‘by the KGB to perform one or more missions which also involved

his penetration of the Agency and its operations. It was
decided, therefore, that the physical circumstances of Nosenko's
stay in this country would have to be drastically changed if
the Agency were to carry out its counterinte! Ligence responsi-
bilities and adhere to the terms of the parole agreement. As
a result, he was moved to quarters where his.movements could
be more casily controlled, and his outing privileges were
suspended pending resolution of bona fides.

It is worth noting that had we not taken the above action
but accepted Nosenko at face value, it is quite possible that
we would have proceeded with a series of operational actions

en the basis of his information. The results of some of these

actions could have been very embarrassing to the U.S. Govérnnient:

politically and damaging to U.S. national security. For exam-

ple, his chief operational proposal at the time, and one that.

he was most insistent that we should proceed with immediately,

involved the compromise of a very senior Soviet official.

Nosenko's bona fides had not | yet been established. It was

agreed that no DS number would be issued to Nosenko, and that

The Secretary of State, Ambassador Thompson, and other:
senior officials in the Department of State were informed of
our reservations about Nosenko's bona fides and our feurs that
he might be a dispatched KGB agent. In discussions about the

possibility of Nosenko's eventual deportation, the Secretary

of State expressed serious concern about the adverse reaction:
that such a move might have on other potential defectors.

The Director of Security, State Department, was informed:
of the bona fides problem at an.carly date. We have worked
closely with this office since then on the problem of eval-
wating the significance of Nosenko's information as it affects
the security interests of the State Department.

Because so much of Nosenko's information affected U.S,

internal security matters for which the FBI bears primary

responsibility, and because the possibility that Nosenko was.

Nosewco's case on 1 April 1964, the FRI interposed no objec-

tions to our proposal to restrict Nosenko's mavements and

commence hostile interrogation. Subsequently, the. FI for- _

The then Acting Attorney General Mr. Nicholas Katzenbach

ervations about Nosenko on 2 April 1964 and an opinion was’
sougit from him both as to interpretation of the exclusion
and parole agreement, and as to how we should proceed in the
event that it proved necessary to deport Nosenko from this
country.

Eftorts to Keep the KGR from Learning of Our Awareness of

s True Status

From the time we learned that Nosenko had been sent to

this country on a KGB mission it was obvious that if we were

1o *

SECAET -

to have the time to analyze and resolve this case, and to.
plan and execute appropriate countermeasures, it'was essential
that we attempt to keep the KGB from learning of our awareness

of Nosenko's true status. Consequently, detailed knowledge

of the depth and scope of our suspicions about Nosenko, and

the implications thercof, was restricted tu a very few people
in the Agency and the. intelligence community. Nonetheless,

we did advise key policy echelons. and principals in the intel-

. ligence community, even though this carried the inevitable

risk of leakage.

Soviet Inspired Inquiries

In 1966 there were several indications that the, Soviets
were making a serious effort to find out what happened to
Nosenko and to force him to the surface. The most blatant
and unusual of these was the .approach by a Soviet journalist,
Yuriy KOROLEV (a known KGB agent), to the French magazine
Paris Match with an offer to provide photographs and materials
for an exclusive story of Nosenko and his family. According
to Korolev, Nosenko's wife was considering an approach to an
international juridicial organization in an effort to obtain
compensation from Nosenko for damages caused by his abandon-
ment of her and her children. In responding to this approach

we quoted a statement, purporting to be from Nosenko himself,

me!

SECRET

14-00000

SECRET

to the effect that Nosenko considers this approach to repre-
sent blatant and cruel manipulation of his family by the KGB-
and that he will not lend himself to the scheme by agreeing

to an interview or in any other way.

Nosenko's Status

To recapitulate, Nosenko entered the United States on

12 February 1964 on parole to the Agency under the provisions |

of Section 212 (d) (5) of the Immigration and Nationality
Act. Parole responsibility is delegated to the Agency by
the Attorney Gencral under the terms of an agreement executed
by the Attorney General and the [71 on 10 February 1955,
which states: /
"After parole of such aliens, the Central Intel-
ligence Agency will assume responsibility for
‘care, supervison and control of a kind and
degree it believes consistent with the internal.”
security needs of the United States during con-
“tinuance of their parole status."
In accordance with our understanding of this agreenent, and
because we had reason to believe that Nosenko was a conscious
and willing agent of a hostile intelligence service, we
ensured that he was under our direct observation and control

at all times from the moment of his arrival in the United

From 12 February to 4 April 1964 it was possible to

keep Nosenko ata location where he could enjoy a certain
amount of movement and ‘of contact with the outside world.
After 4 April 1964, for reasons explained above, it was.
necessary to keep him incommunicado at.a location which is
known to no one outside of the Agency {and to very few within
it). Authorization for Nosenko to remain in this country
under the Special Agreement Procedures was periodically
extended by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Although his freedom of movement had been severely
restricted, Nosenko was not maltreated and he made no com-

plaint about his treatment. On the contrary, we had several

written statements from him in which he stated that our
handling of him was justified and even beneficial.

Disposal : ;

From the time that Nosenko was brought to this country

: we thought about the possibility of his eventual deportation

‘. as a contingency measure. In carly 1964, we thought that it

might be possible to mitigate the political and propaganda
drawbacks of a forced deportation by announcing that Nosenko
has confessed his true KGB role. With the passage of time,
however, and in view of our much firmer conclusions about his

real role and mission and our clearer understanding of what

13 ; wee

SEGHET

this implied, it was apparent that great practical problems
stood in the way of his deportation to cither the USSR or a
third country.

USSR: Noscnko has categorically stated on numerous. -; :.
occasions that he will never contemplate return to the USSR,
and, although we suspect that he might secretly welcome such
# move, we would expect him to act out his part to the end
with loud protests that he was being shipped to his death,

etc. When the possibility of expulsion was discussed with

Department of State officials in 1964, both the Secretary of
State and Ambassador Thompson expressed their concern for

the adverse effect this might have on other potential defec-
tors. Forcible repatriation of political refugees is against
long established U.S. policy, and would be certain to arouse

violent reaction from ethnic minority groups in the United

States. Under these circumstances an alleged "confession
by Nos enko would have come under very close scrutiny, and
might have backfired very badly. Another point that had ‘to
be considered was the possibility that the Soviets, again
playing their part, might have refused to accept Noscnko on
the grounds that he has renounced his Sovict citizenship.
Third Country: Although we believed’ it likely that

Nosenko would accede to deportation to a third country,

14

there is certainly no country in the free world on which we

could conceivably have unloaded Nosenko without first inform-

ing them of his true status. Even if we considered this a

desirable objective, it seemed certain that the Department |
of State would veto such a piece “of intergovernmental ‘duplic-

ity on the basis of the political risks involved.

volved." -

3. A search of Office of Security file resources has
reflected ‘information pertinent to a case in which a defector
was physically abused at an overseas location, and the Agency
employee was later terminated by the DCI. It is not known
whether the following case is identical to the referenced
case on page 170 of the Commission Report, but the facts

appear to be quite similar,

4, Information developed by this Office of possible in-
terest to the Inspector General, pertains to one John Torpats,
an ¢x-CIA employee, and one Eduard Oun, an Estonian defector.

S. Torpats was born in 1898 in Estonia, and became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926, Torpats was employed by
CIA in February 1949 and was terminated 30 January 1961. | The
file. information reflected that in July 1956, Torpats was found
guilty of mistreatment of an alien by a Special Inquiry Board

in Frankfurt, West Germany. The alien involyed was Eduard
Oun, an Estonian who defected from Estonia through Sweden
in 1955.

6. The incident in Frankfurt involved Histreatment of

‘Oun during interrogations directed by Torpats. The charges

of physical abuse included the striking of Oun with the fist;
application of turpentine and ointments to various parts of
the body, the scrubbing of Oun's body with a brush, and forc-
ing Oun to stand in the nude as long as eight days during
interrogations with only very brief rest periods,

7. Torpats was returned to Headquarters and was brought
before an Employment Review Board for consideration of secpara-
tion from the Agency. The Board's recommendations initially
were that Torpats be "transferred to an area outside the
Clandestine Services." Torpats appealed the decision, and a
later recommendation included reduction in grade from GS-14
to GS-13, Torpats later received unsatisfactory fitness re-
Ports and engeged in various "in house" battles with Agency
officials concerning his employment. :

8. Torpats was later terminated in accordince with the
authority granted the DCI under Section WO2(Cy of the National
Security Act of 1947, as ammended, effective 30 January 1961,
Later in 1961, Torpats filed suit against the DCI contesting
his dismissal, and the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia granted the government's motion for summary judgment
against Torpats. Torpats appealed the decision, and the U.S.
Court of Appeals, in 1962, upheld the lower court's ruling
that Torpats' termination was legal.

9. The Office of Security file of Eduard Oun contained
little information other than interrogation reports dated 1956.
It was not clear from file information whether Oun entered the
United States after the Frankfurt incident. The most recent
document contained in the Oun file was dated 17 September
1956 and noted that Oun had been psychiatrically examined and
found qualified for Agency sponsored immigration to the U.S.

under Public Law 203.

10. It is noted that Office of Security files contained
only fragmentary information in Tegard to certain areas of the
Torpats' case. File review indicated, however, the DDO, OGC
and the Inspector General's office will probably have addition-
al information concerning this matter.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Rockefeller Commission ‘Contact

Mason Cargill told me today that the reference
in the Commission report to an employee who was fired
because he abused a defector came from a deposition by
Dick Helms: Helms could not remember an exact name,
but from the description which he gave on his deposition,
it is clear that the employee who was fired was John -.
Torpats. He was discharged by Allen W. Dulles in 1960.

Torpats, himself a Lithuanian refugee, was working
in the Defector Reception Center in Frankfort, Germany,
In the course of interrogating another Lithuanian - -
defector, Torpats beat him. After Torpats was fired,
he sued the Director (then NcCone). He lost the case.
