Dear Mr. Bisson: :

te .. I have seen the corresponderice exchanged between .

; Collected for the China Forum. A draft for the sum in

I do not know in the name of whom or what Miss Smedley

- spoake of the China Forum. Sinoe she was not tn China at
the time the Forum Suspended, nor has she corresponded
with moon the subjéct, I consider 1% necessary to place
“pefore you and the other contributors an. account of the
circumstances in which the Forum cessed. publication.

. Binoe you apparently gathered the contributore together
in a meeting to hear what Mise: Smedley: had to. say, I
would appreciate it deeply if you would gather them onoe

“mors to-hear my account. The enclosed 1s a copy of a
letter aent by me last May to the Chinese Communist Party.

- It has been published tn China tn a Chineée translation

.and copies have been sent.abroad but has not been pub-

- lished in English as far.as-I know. I do not know the
names of the people who vere’ good enough to contribute:
to the Forum but their interest in the. matter warranta
placing before them the atory. of what happened to the
magasine. I trust, out of eimple fairriess to me,. you
wilh be good enough to give thea this opportunity. 7

—— or greatly ‘regret’ ‘any ‘Anodnvenitencé” r ‘embarrasement
to which you have been put in this matter. . I do hopa,
. -howéver, ‘that my letter will enlighten ‘you. and your
- friends and enable: ‘you to. appreciate the difficulties
which have: ariesen.. I know of'no.project to revive the
China Forum’ at ‘the. ‘present time. Should sich occur, the
 Yesultant. publication would be of a Considerably different
.Oharacter from the one'I edited, as will be obvioue from:
the facta given in ay letter to the C. P. I think | people”
Bho are interested in supporting the revolutionary move=
ment here: should know these facta.

To the ) contral Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

The twoayoar period of my extra-organizational Cole
laboration with the Chinese Communist Party bas come to
and the China Forum which I founded and edited dur
hat: time, has been forced to suspend ‘publication.: In

- “the intarest. ‘of ‘our. vhole movement ag well as in my per-
sonal intereet, I coneider it necessary to record here -
-and publiah the hietery of the Ohina Forum and. the ctr

cumstances of ite suspension. You refused. me the oppor
tunity, to lay ‘the matter before the membership of the
party aven when I offered to do.eo in “your own. organs and
not through the colums of the Forum. ‘hen, wrongly, I

“permitted the Forum to go down in silence, you turned

around and in your organs and near organs in China and.
abroad you proceeded with the usual slandere of "botrayer*
and ®counter~revolutionary®, In so doing you didn't have
the courage or the aisple honesty to state that you pre-
sented the China Forum with an ultimatum and forced its
suspénsion because in’ reply its editor raised. questions

‘whioh are being placed before the whole movement today
_ by the International’ Left Opposition. Nor did you state
* that’ you: deliverately smashed the Forum for this reason

despite ay repeated and extendéd offers to continue pubdli-
cation ae before-on.a ‘etraight entisKuomintang, anti-~
imperialist basis, leaving thase various problems to ‘de
thrashed. out first privately among oureelves. In other -
worde, you deliberately forced. suspension of the Coina ..
Forua despite the fact, on your own admission, that its
lose yaaa serious low to’ the revolutionary movement in

~ China, that it.-mean’ the disappearance of an organ which

for two. year you had conéidered an extremely Valitable

. inetrument in the. hands of the movement. Here, aé in the

broader Leduee which léd to our differences, your biind
anoe to false policiea was once ‘more demonstrative
of your Teadiness to place your factional interests above
the intéreata of sae. Chinese Revolution.

In golhg back over the history of the Forum, T think
thé vicious character of. your action becomes evén more —-

‘evident ghen I start with the fact that from beginning to

end I functioned mot as a member of the party but aa a-
wiliing eympathizer- who Was prepared to throw all hia
energiés into a job he saw he could do - edit and publish
an organ in China which could help mobilise the forces

of this country for struggle against the Kuomintang and
the imperialists by exposing the regime of terror and
privation which they have. in-common imposed upon the

.masees of the Chinese people. Permit me to recall at

tion for time or labor. You gave the Forum financial

aid but I never received a dollar from you that was not
put into the paper. I refused your offers of compensa~
tion and earned my living elsewhere. Your only. claim on
eo wap ay full-hearted loyalty to the Commun’ st ideal and

22-
our Common dedication to the atrudgie ayainet a regime
of bate and misery and oppreeston. In the end you for
feited. this claim by ceasing any longer to be in ay eyes ..
bonest or-effective leaders of this etruggle.

Although you helped the ‘Yorum finanotally, the part
you played in building it up from the day it started in
Jonuary, 1952, to the day of its last appearance in Janu-_
ary 1034, was. insignificant. My repeated requests for on
cooperation in sattera of circulation and material for ~ .
publication wérnt largely unsatisfied throughout ‘that tise.

.. You nevér supplied me with the reports I..so0 frequently

- and urgently sought, ‘particularly on trade untona, atrike
, gtrugglee, the Red Armies, the Red districte, etc. Svery-

' thing the Forum.did and became was the fruit of the wrk

‘of a tiny group of devoted collaborators (the most im
portant of whom had no connection with you whatever) and
myself who had to depend almost entirely on “our omn re- ‘
souroes for everything we did and published, At every
crisis in the Forus's existence, when it was banned by
the French authorities in Shanghai at the very outset;
when it was hounded and persecutdd by the American and
Chinese authorities in the susmer of 1933, when through
Britien police pressure it was thrown out of every avall-
able printing ship in the city; when the pasudo-Fascist
Blue Shirts again and again threatened the printing plant
which I built up partially through personally contracted -
loans «= it was invariably through my own initiative, with
the help of the little Forum staff, that we pulled our-
selves up by the bootstraps every tims and carried on to
a point in January this year where the Forum waa flouriteb
ing and growing daily in circulation, prestige, and in- .

- fluenoe despite the many formidable obstacles in its way.
The formation of the China Forum Readers Association, .
which in the brief ‘space of three monthe spread to eleven

an . ; eities in five provinces, developing into a mighty poten-

Lescith.s > tfal-géapon ‘for the revolutionary movement, was the prod-

oe uct of spontaneous action on the part of the Forun'a .

Yreadere, later eponsored and led by the paper itself.

All these were the Forum's own achievements, not yours.

By your arbitrary and ‘criminal action you shattered thea
in the full stride of their growth. Because to my bitter
disappointment. I had not_nor could I secure the resources il
_ v0-oarry on myself - owing largely to the difficult ‘consi-|
. thons of work and the isposaibility of getting revenue |
from the paper iseelf - all that had ‘been aohieved and

was to be aonieved was ground into the dust.

Il.

From almost the very begtaning of ay active , work -
which [ date from the time [ began reporting events in
China ina ‘Communist way ~ a number of questions presented
themselves to me in increasingly forcible form. These i

’ arose originally from my discovery of the gross distor= i
tions and exaggerations whicn I found to be characteriatic |
of Communist propaganda tn Chins and abroad. I define

. propaganda as the skilful, clear, accurate and wholly
i truthful reporting of the facts linked to an incisive,

purrosive

purposive interpretation and & plan of action for deale
ing with the facte ina Tevolutionary way. I learned —
SGle feu thu sade ‘and wurk oY Lenin and hig Bolshevik o
comrades who taught ue-that the truth comes from the

‘masees themselvea and that only disaster can result froa.

telling thea lies. [I.have.never learned to the contrary
that it was my revolutionary duty to work in any other
way although [ soon found that the present day Communi et
Party prees makes a praotica of distingutehing between

propaganda and truth.

Bxamplea of exaggeration and dietortion most strik-

' - dng to me vere naturally those which applied to China,
‘ bocause here I could oheok allegations with known facts.

I firot wrote those down to tne ignorance or inoavacity
of individuals. {[ felt that Communist editors abroad
would publish accurate facts about China if they could
get. then. Accordingly with a friend I tried to set up.
an independent mail news service and sent weekly bulletins
to papers all over the world Giving brief, sharp, faotual’.
accounts of what wae going on. ‘This wag in the fall of i

“4931 after my return from the area of the great Central

China floods of that summer. [ searcely understood then
why thie service failed to secure any reaponse from tha
Communist press abroad. after about three monthe I had
to suspend it for lack of support. It simply didn't got
published except in a few organs which were not official }
Communist Party papers, including the New York Militant.//
-It wasn't long before I began to perceive, witha
deeper etudy of international events and the history of
the Chinese Revolution, that a consistent thread ran-
through the distortions and exaggerations which I. found
Dot only in brief casual. reports of-ourrent eventa but
in the solemn. pronunctanentoes. made by delegates before

plenums of the E.0.0.1.°{ discovered that these departures - a

from the truth vere mado necessary by the official premise

“that ever since the. catastrophe of 1927 .a mighty, upeurg=

ing revolutionary movement has been marching forvard in-
China to the ‘very brink of seizure of power under the

‘ leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, I discovered

‘hat these exaggerations were necessary because the pren-
lee-was falee and along with it all the basic tenets of

the policies being pursued by the Communist International |

and the Communist Party in China. I cannot begin here to
give a summary of some of these distortions (which fT
verbally cited to you by the dozen) ranging from partiou-
lar incidents (the. wilfully false picture given of the
cotton mill eatrixe in. Shanghai in January, 19234, even to
the point cf transposing it to February to heighten the -
impression given of the workera' role in the Shanghai war)
to bigh flown generalizations like the statement reoently
made before the Plenum of the &.C.C.I. that the C.c.?. has
won over the majority of the Chinese working class and

tbe peasantry. ;

ta denying the footual truth of thio premise, whence
flowa the whole policy of the Communist Party in China, I:
deprecate not a whit the aagnificent militancy and courage
of Chineee workero, striking again and again and fighting

’ against

against terrifio odds in defense of their very Lives;
nor the noroio struggles waged by peasants all over the
Oountry; nor the fight of the Red Armies againet the .

‘Kuomintang, -I. morely respect the cold, indisputable fact} j

that theao. struggles ‘are defensive, not offoneivo, that

“they are teolated, desperate and unorganised. with very

few exoeptiona ~ a few small strikes here and there and
the larger: exoeption of. the Hed. army =: they are without - .
organised revolutionary leadership. Moreover the déveltop= po |
ment. of this leadership, the task of the C.P.; 1a ‘prodegd=
ing at.a tragically retarded pace owing to the. falae :
policies. ‘and inept tactics of the party.

Tn denying: ‘tho presence ‘ofa mighty revolutionary
upsurge (i.e., a Vaat, organised march toward the. seizure
of power) I respect facta made ‘ehill Clearer perbeps when
compared to the facta and figures of the monster mass move~ —
menta of the 1¥25-a7 period. ‘Tha! tragio erroré of the
Comauniot leadership in- 1927 were: iprimarily reaponaible |
for the decapitation ‘of that great movement and because
no lessons have been drawn from those eventa to this very.
day, these exrore, monstrously accumulated, aré atill ro-
6ponsible for the tragedies of today, ,But for the purpose
of our comparison here, let us for exanplo take the single
faot that in 1926 in Greater Shanghai there were 3257
strikes. [n 1933 there were 82. Let ue Temember that
on the eve of the workors' seigure of power in! Shanghat
in Mareh, 1927, there were more than 800,000" torkors,
handicrafteren and petty traders out on the streets fights
ing with arms in hands for demanda of a farefeaohing pos ,
litical character. A olose oheck for the gatare country
in the latter half of 1933 showed me that Yeas than one- -
thirtieth of that number were; engaged in strikeo and other
disputes during any given month and that almoat invariably

-: the demande were defenaive: demands against wage oute and
- locKouta.

Moreover, the lack of cohesive ledderahip -:

often in departments of the same. factory or in’one or nore
of:a group of factories = or even bometines lack of aven

“tha, most ‘elementary organization. - hag in almost evory a 7

case led to deadening failure and relatively. oney betrayal
of the .
“‘Kuomintang...In 1935" the” shooting of thirteen etudents -
by Britian police in ¢ ‘hanghai wae the touch-off for a
general strike which paralyzed the oity and whioh wae
peconded by vast sympathy strikes which broke like a
series of tidal Waves ovar the entire country. In Janu- !
ary, 1932, when the Japsneee imperialinta used the Shanghai . Ste
International Settlement as a base for opetationa which an
coset the lives of tens of thousands of Chinese, not a
aingle strike. ‘Anterrupted the normal course of the pub-
lic or other avrvices in that settlement. In the factories
there were no strikes tut a large soale lockout to whioh
the overwheluing majority of Shanghai's workers submitted

without protest.

The dogged, peraistent strugsle carried on by amall
‘seotions of the rank and file workers in isolated instences
in recent years io tribute to the magnificent fibre of

; Chinese

14-00000

ah re

Chinese workers, “It is not evidence that a revolutionary’
seizure of power is on the order of the day. It 1a evi-
dence, along with the heroto sacrifices of thousands who

: have lost lives and liberty in Ciinese revolutionary
etruggle during.the last seven years of Kuomintang re-

action, that. tt ts vossible to fight the monstrous white
terror whioh Chinese Communists freouently cite as a

‘reason for the insufftoiency of their work. Yet. it 16
largely because this terror hae not been fought effectively

that the Kuomintang regime, desvite the. fact that it is
rotting and orumbling, oan still keep the lid down on the:

boiling, simmering hatred of the peovle it rules. Unless -
_ the martyrdom of thousands of China's finest workers,
' peasante and revolutionary intellectuals is to be in vain,

we must turn resolutely away from the folly of calling to
insurrection when what 18 needed is painstaking education,

-, organization and the sponsorship of day-to-day struggles
of the masses for. demooratic denands, the. slow building up

of a varty and mags organizations and a covenent which

“will be able’ to command. the forces capable of. carrying out

an insurrection.

In the case of the widespread but ieolated and in~
dividual cases of peasant uprisings, and thie includes
the Red Armies in Kiangsi, theese struggles await the
leadership of a strong working class movement before they
Gan have a sucoessful issue. The Red armies in their re~
stricted and Surrounded -areas and with their meagre re~-

- sources have. fought heroicelly against the Kuomintang

attacks upon them. But until the Kuomintang is shaken

from its bulwarks in the tmperialist controlled working -
Olass. centres, their prospect of revolutionary triumph
remaing necessarily dim. No revolutionary purpose is .
served by taking refuge in the fiction that these armies
have vcrolétarien leadership because individual workers, |
eundoubtedly leaders of superior quality and courage, have —
been torn from their fadtories-end their fellow-workers ~~
and sent down to ocouvy key positions in the Red Army .
distriots and in the. Red armies themselves. Indeed, this
common practice of extracting the most conscious and’ pro-
gressive working olass elémente from their working olass
environment and sending them down to the Red districts is
a good index to the oriminal transposition of emphasis
which has helped paralyze the working class movement in
the cities. If the White Terror doesn't oarry off the
workers! leaders as they arise, the C.P..does and has done
so in hundreds of cases. This helpé in no small part to
explain why it haa also been impossible to mobilize a ,
genuine masse unti-Japanese movement in the fact of mili- -
tary aggression and why the White Terror of the Kuomin- -
tang has succeeded, by filling mass graves and innumer=
able prisons with the martyred dead and living, in doen-
ing the anti-imperialist movement or efforts toward the
organization of such a movement and paving the way for

, the ever increasing enoroschments of the imperialists.

The varty has not yet grinned and directed the deep and

“bitter and often inartioulate batred of the masses of the

péovle for their oppressors and this inoludes large eéo-
‘tiona of the lower vetty bourgeolote who could be won by
eucceseful sass pressure from below. This 19 beoause the —

I cannot .here go into the many-faceted problena and”
iasues which flow from these facts with regard to the  -

volictea and tactics of the Chinese revolutionary movemen
Nor extending to:the international scene need I go into -
the terrific effects of the Gernan catastrophe nor the
‘storm of questions whioh: has been directed at the-C.t,

taplications which arise from the polioies.of the 0; ley
with nartiocular reference to the late develonments in
Soviet foreign policy, the Litvinov-Roosevelt agreement,
the forthcoming mooted entrance of the U.S.S.R. into the
League of Nations and in a enaller but equally oharaster~
totio way, the forthcoming association of the U.S.S5.R.

\ Ill.
i But precisely because’ at all costs I desired to oarry
“on the Forum's open struggle agoinsat the common enemy ~
Jagainet the Kuomintang and’ the imperialists - I sedulously
‘avoided bringing these issues into the coluins of the paper,
.. dnoreasingly against my better judgment. 1 leaned over far
: - Backward ‘in this respect. This expressed itself in many
of the. current lasues vith which we had to deal.

“SY ask you_to recall. ‘the whole uvbil) fight whiok the. co
Forum waged on behalf of Paul. end Gertrud Ruegg in the . : ; °
epring and sumeer of 1933 during which tise I repeatedly
‘warned against the emvhasis whioh was being placed on. the
, . Slégal® agsveots of the case and the ‘negotiations’ with -
-' the Kuomintang to the detriment of mass pressure ‘and the -
a dapitalization of thé cage for political nurvoses. You
'. gatd lip service to the need for mass. vressure - partiow-
-larly here in China-= but in fact the ‘legalities and |
futile negotiations remained the major pillars of the de- .
‘Yense., Until in the very end I finally rebelled, I vasn't : : a
even permitted to. give Ruegg his honoursble ahd rightful: oe
‘title - secretary of the Pan Pacific Trade Union Secre-
tartat. Yét, although I felt the struggle for the Ruegga
wae being seriously handicavved “by the tactics being pur-
sued, I carrted on the fight with all the energy at my
: command and you will recall that it was I who oreated the
| looal defense committee. and was chiefly resyonsible for
the uidesoread press vropaganda and the considerable
symnathy which we aroused. Yet the strictly non-political
attitude which Ruegg wae forced to assume at the trial
‘(in contrast to the highly rolitical at«itudce of his
prosecutors) waa An my opinion one of the major reasons

for

‘for the fate to whivh he and his wife were condemned.

position and his personality exceedingly well. He Was as’
much a Trotskyist. as Wei Lan-fang ie! Yet you actually
demanded that I ignore my own knowledge of the man and in
my artiole on Fukten set him down as a "Trotakyist®. I.
waa faced on the one hand by your demands that I erite —
‘falsehoods to suit your policies and on the other by ny
.deeo desire to set forth: the actual facts about the Oppo-
: sittvon!s atti tude towards the Fukien regize. But once
bake _ more, ‘to‘vreserve the shreds of our relationshiv, I drove :
no “wg middle course and did neither, leaving the whole question... =. ;

out of my article. ~ S, ;
Despite the facts that these issues weighed more and
more heavily upon me,. despite the fect. that events in
China and abroad were pressing themselves sore and more
imperatively on the-oonoerns of every sincere revolution-
ary, I still tried to.keep the Forum balanced on its
ribbon-like path, concentrating on the anti-Kuomintang,
anti-imperialiat struggle, and in 80 doing fulfilling at
least a partial function as_a revolutionary organ. i
deeply folt, however, that I’ was betraying ry readera by
' avoiding thess issues. How could I write of Germany and
-avoid all the implications of that disaster? How could
'. I write of America’s recognition of the U.S.3.R. and still
fail to say that. the Communist International had virtually
: ‘ been murdered ‘at Nashington? -How oould I warn against the |
a . dangere of imvertaliet intervention in the U.S.S.R. and
na still not point out. that Soviet foreign solicy vas in
: - fact. dally heightening the danger of such iatervention? ..
Yet I.eomehow did 80 and sought in whatever way possible
‘to retain some basis for our continued collaboration.

Nevertheless, abruptly in January of this year you.
forced ‘an ultimatum upon me and subsequently forced the
. break in-our relationship because I could not and would |
. not, at your demand, ‘devote the China Forus to policies
; which I could not and do not believe compatible with the
, interests of the Chinese. Revolution and the international
_ proletarian ravolution. I could not, at your demend, set
aside the convictions to which I had literally been driven.
‘py the stinging lash of catastrophic, events in China, - of a
Germany and the world over. Partioularly ay deep inter- : oa
. est in Chinese events during the last three years made it :
' {mpcssible for me, finally, to give active support to
policies and tactics whose disastrous effects sere being
a thousandfold confirmed for me by the tragic events of
‘every swiftly-vaseing day.. I could not ignore questions
which strike at the roots of our work and the whole struc-
- ture of our hopes for a revolutionary future.

. Despite the fact that these ‘questions are rocking
the entire International today, you denied ay right to

Subject was born: in 1910, and is a member of a wealthy family. He became ,
a firmly convinced Trotskyist: ‘in his youth,’ and remined one till the. time of 7
PearlHarbor. He is now regarded as a renegade by his former Trotskyist colleagues,
because he has disavowed the prineiplés of world revolution, tumed away from
Trotsky's teachings, and since 1939 hes’ been writing mtriotic Propaganda for the

United States Government. . ; ; :
He went to China about 1930, and wrote two books dealing with Chinese-

politics » Five Years of Kuomintang Reaction (1932); and The Tragedy of the Chinesa

Revolution (938). Bot of these volumes axpressed the author! Trotskyist
