the United States and returned legally to Cuba(in March 1961 to serve as yy :

resident agent in.Havana.> Since then he has built a net @f over twenty fly

sub-agents and“*has*sent back 140 S/W messages, from which upwards of

- fifty intelligence disseminations have been made. He is highly :

‘. motivated for his work and under effective control by JMWAVE. The
quality of his production is, for-the most part, very good and improving

although‘he is at times distracted by an understandable interest in

para-military operations. Operationally he is very skillful; however, .

he has been known to. take unnecessary risks. There is no reason to

think that he is under hostile control nor that the operation is likely’

in the future to be turned against us. There De however, the real.

risk that he may one day fa}1 into a G-2 trap baited with the Escambray
guerrillas. If so, this Will be due to the fact that contact with the
guerrill was his first assignment and, although he has been re-

: directed "to intelligence collection, he sometimes seems to feel that

e has led in his primary mission. This, plus the fact that he a
evident. believes that the end is now very close, is apt to make him.

the names of other contacts for checking. In the case of AMFAUNA-4, (

it, he put his misgivings in-writing: "Right away AMFAUNA-1 arranged
for a personal interview, taking utmost precautions» since we have
had sad previous experiences with members of CASTRO's armed forces."

8.. Once he has recruited a sub-agent, AMFAUNA=1 manages to keep i
an independent eye on the former's security. On more than one occasion

and that for the time being he is staying away from him.

_ 9. In general AMFAUNA-1 seems to trust in the efficiency of his
security precautions. On 25 February 1962 he reported that Identity

AMFAUNAS 7: through 13, may be in error on this point. It would be
more in keeping with AMFAUNA-1's known modus operandi for him to have .

b. AMFAUNA=3: AMFAUNA-1'e first mention of her
is in his S7Wmesdage No. 127 dated 4 May 1962. She has
provided information on (military hospitala#‘and has a
trusted contact (Identity 7) Gn the G-2.),4She also was
AMFAUNA-1's cutout to Identity-12, who was a( Havana
contact) of the(guerriila leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ)24In
early June 1962 she waa approached by Identity-8 who
claimed to be the naw contact to the (RAMIREZ)organization. i
(See also paragraph 58 below.) On 15%March. 1962 AMFAUNA-3 .
was traced by ODIBEX who proposed to use her in their
Operation CASINO. A negative trace reply was given at that
time. Headquarters is requested to ascertain whether ODIBEX
has a valid prior claim on this agent.

c. ANFAUNA-4} He is a high-ranking Cuban Army officer
who has provide ‘AUNA-1 with documantary information which
ought to be of some value, although JMWAVE has not yet seen
it, it having gone to Headquarters via Madrid) through the *
channel described in paragraph 11 above\32He “also claims to f

| was introduced to him by Identity-13.0l For a further
discussion of this matter, see paragraph 56 below.

Lo: d. AMBOQA+1: The origin of AMFAUNA-l's contact with

this agent, who has also been recruited independently by
. JMWAVE, is uncertain. He first mentioned her in October \ 6

1961 as his cutout to Identity-14,(a Cubana Airlines pilot)
who had formerly been a contact of ‘AMCUSP-1 and who subsequent-
ly defected. AMFAUNA-1's last mention of her was on 15 .
November when he reported that she had given him a map show-
ing artillery installations on the south coast of Las Villas.
It is possible that AMFAUNA-1 has broken contact with her,
but since he has not reported having done so it is considered a

_more likely that she remains hie cutout to(two Cubana Airlines?
pilote}who are known to be still reporting * ,

(1) AMFAUNA-18: He was recruited in March 1962,
and has provided AMFAUNA-1 with(passenger lists) 24
and the\location of artillery emplacements) which
he has (spotted from his aircraft). it is rot tknown
how AMFAUNA~1 first met AMFAUNA-18, and it is
possible that AMFAUNA-1 meets directly with him.

| It is only surmised that AMBOA-1l, is his cutout to
| | him.

(2) AMFAUNA-19: He was recruited at the same
time aS AMFAUNA-18. Althcugh AMFAUNA-1 did not
explicitly say so, it can be inferred that he and
AMFAUNA-18 are witting of each other's recruitment.

information on Cuban (airfields) and is the cutout to a group
of people. employed at({Rancho Boyeros Airport)24It is believed
‘that the identities of all these people have not yet been
reported, but they seem to be effective. On 29 May 19621
AMFAUNA-1 reported the arrival of an undocumented Soviet ‘plane

said one of his agents had obtained clandestinely. Following
are the persons with whom AMFAUNA-5 is known to be in contact.

that the two children havea different matronymics, that neither of them
is his wife's last name, and that all three dependents have different
addresses. It is ascumed that this is his third wife. Since AMFAUNA-1
has never mentioned her in any of his S/W correspondence, it is also
assumed that she has gone the way of her tyo predecessors.

20, %It is evident from his S/W messages that AMFAUNA-1 derives
great personal satisfaction from his work against the CASTRO regime.
His connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work.
This is believed to be a strong element of control. There have heen
many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 te do
something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is
believed to be effective.

Previous History of the Operation ~ January to May 1961:

the CASTRO regime as early as(December 196304 As with so much elge in

85, Identity-55 and Identity-56 were mentioned briefly as active
during the period from December 1961 to Ap:i1 1962. The former had
been a contact of AMRUNG- pl and seems to have gone into hiding; in any
case, nothing more has been reported on him. The latter was an agent
of AMFAUNA-1 in (Santiago de Cubajoin January 1962 he was in niding and
awaiting a chancé to go into asylum.

46. AMPAUNA-1l1 remained active durin; this period, and AMFAUNA-9,
10, and 12 ware added to the operation. Four descriptions of there

Production:

48, JMWAVE records do not show thé tocal number of AMFAUNA
reports disseminated since January 1561. The figure is at least fifty,
and is believed to be nearer cone hunired, if the present frequency. of
dissemination can be a criterion. I: content they have leaned ,
heavily toward the activities of insurgent groups, militia movemants,
location of artillery, and aviation matters. There has been a more
recent tendency toward political and economic information, which is
being encouraged by JMWAVE, Evaluations of his production are lacking.

49, The possibility that AMFAUNA-1 is a double agent is censider-
ed remote. His successful LCFLUTTER, the fact (or what is believed to
be the fact) that his close friend and fellow agent cusP-i) was
executed, and AMFAUNA-l's owi character and background, alljargue
against the proposition that he was originally dispatched by the G-2.
However, it must be admitted that the LCFLUTTER caribe beaten.; Also
that there is no proof, other. than the fact that AMCU poh uize is
in the JMWAVE area and behaving like a widow, that ANCUSP-1)was really
executed. There is documentary evidence plin the formolof a letter

50. Similarly, all that is known about AMFAUNA-1's background
comes from AMFAUNA-1's own statemants embodied in his PRQ Part I, No.
confirmation of this information has aver been obtained. From this
point of view there is no guarantee that AMFAUNA-1 ie what he claims
to be. For all the proof to the contrary available to JMWAVE, he
could as easily have been al Spanish) Communist as a member of the

: $1. These points are listed for the sake of ccmpletenggao, but ©
little@limportance is attached to them. Tht known fact that (QUANTUM=82
and (QUANTUM-52 fonsider AMFAUNA-1 reliable suggests that he at least
was not a(Spanish)Communist. And an unusually extensive independent
view haa''!been obtained. of AMFAUNA-1l's operations through the reports
and debriefings of eight of his egents who have either escaped to or
are in communication with the United States. The defection

|, story. Finally, AMCOG-3 has reported by &,/W that AMCOG-2 is in contact

~

with AMFAUNA-1, and AMFAUNA-2's telephone conversations with AMCUTLER-1}
provide a continuing check on the safety ¢ud whereabouts of AMFAUNA~1.9/

52. For the same reasons, the possibility is heavily discounted
that AMFAUNA-1 has been caught and doubled by the G-2 since his arrival
in Cuba, Additional indications that all is still well are the fact
that he never omits the safety signal that was given him for use in his
S/W, that his operational activities are consistent with his character
and background, and that the reporting of his agents is consistent with
thejr access to information.

53. Whether AMFAUNA-1 is now in danger of being detected, and
whether the G-2 could double him if they do catch him, are two
questions remaining to be considered. Taking the second question first,
it is believed that the chances of the G-2 running a successful CI
operation against KUBARK through AMFAUNA-1 are extremely slim. To be
sure, the G-2 has certain weapons that¢they could use against AMPAUNA-1. |
His father is already lin prison, serving a fifteen-year sentence, and
his mother and two children(are atill in Cuba ac potential hostages.)
It is also conceivable that the G-2 could use AMFAUNA-1's own interest
in paramilitary operations as a lever by persuading him that KUBARK,
by neglecting to support the insurgent leader Oswaldo RAMIREZ, was
responsible for the latter's death and has demonstrated its indifference
to the fate of the Cuban people. This would all take time, however,
because AMFAUNA-1's reaction to arrest, at Least initially, would of,
probably be an attempt tojgmulate his two heroes, AMCUSP-1) and AMRUNG-D.
In the time that it woul@/take the G-2 to break dowm\this resistance,
At UTLER-1) would almosttéertainly have learned, either through his
phone‘leonversations with AMFAUNA-2 0: ‘by the interruption of the same,
«hat something is wrong with AMFAUNA-1. “

; ' $4, The risks that AMFAUNA-1 is now running are believed to be
considerable. for one thing, at least ten persons with varying degrees
of knowledge of his clandeetine operations, have been held temporarily
or permanently by the G-Z, which is believed to be increasing in
competence as a security force. For another, AMFAUNA-1 takes unnecessar
chances, as by interrogating a new and untested agent (AMFAUNA-4) in

the personal automobile of his sister-in-law, or by personally trying

to penetrate a restricted area. And for a third, he has some contacts
which can be dangerous.to him.

55. AMCOG-2 knows too much about AMFAUNA-1 for the latter's good.
It is believed that AMFAUNA-1 himself is aware that this is a potential-
ly serious security weakness, because he ‘took the trouble to report it
(see paragraph 15al above). TMe AMCOG operation is itself a fairly
complex one, and will be analyzed in a separate dispatch. The, aspects
of it which, bear,on the AMFAUNA operation are that AMCOG-2 and(her o c
brother AMéoc-3 dre (close relatives of a very prominent anti-Communistod
Cuban politician) and that they are widely known, both in Cuba and in

prosecution for actspagainst it, is a matter for wonder. It has been
rumorad that (the old°politician\has a blackmail hold over Fidel CASTRO
by virtue of ‘ie possession of very damaging information about CASTRO.
There may be some substance to this rumor. As a young student estes
is believed to have committed criminal acts, and the (old politician
would have been in the best possible position at the time to obtain
proof of them. This might well explain why the family enjove immunity
today.

56. It would seem, though, that an aler* and competent security
service, which the G-2 shows signs of becominy, if it 18 enjoined from
arresting and prosecuting an espionage suspect, would at least try to
control and moniter his operations by penctrating them. It is there-
fore a cause for speculation that, in February 1962, an important
officer of the Cuban Army CAMEAUNA-4 4 allegedly desirous of defecting,
was introduced by Identity-13 to AMCOG-2, and a matter for Jeep concern
that AMCOG-2 passed the lead along to AMFAUNA~1 who accepted it with-
out any prior checking and actually held his first meeting with the
would-be defector in an automobile tracea"le to AMFAUNA-2. Since
then, it has been observed that reports avd sub-sources offared by
AMFAUNA-4 are absorbing an increasing amount of AMFAUNA-1's time. The
military manuals andjcocuments turned over by AMFAUNA-4, and sent ‘to
Headquarters via the (QUANTUM and the (adrid, Station have not yet been
geen by JMWAVE, so it is not ‘yet known whether AMFAUNA-4's production
ean be given a sufficiently high evaluation to allay the doubts raised
by the manner of his recruitment. Headquarters is asked to advise on
this as soon as pogsible, and to provide traces on AMFAUNA-4, comet

57. The other potentially dangerous contacts are, as might be
expected, in the field of para~-military activities. In November 1961 &
AMFAUNA-1 was in touch with Identity-52, a(nephew of Oswaldo RAMIREZ,
through Identity-51, a resident of (Cienfuegos to Identity-52 was
arrested) late in the year 24 AMFAUNA=1 then developed another contact
to the(Gswaldo RAMIREZ group) through Identity-12, (RAMIREZ's Havana )

59, As mentioned in paragraph 15b rhove, ODIBEX has some kind of
interest in AMFAUNA-3, and it may be that their files contain
O gible anawers to some of the questions raised by this develop-
ment. For instance:

a. Why did the RAMIREZ organization not know ox the ’
arrest of Identity-12, one of its own members, which had
occurred at least a month previously?

about Identity-12, how did they know about AMFAUNA-3, and

b. If the RAMIREZ organization was so poorly informed |
why did they think she would be the appropriate person to “

writer of the letter, and the fact that all meetings must
have been arranged and held under clan stine conditions,
how to account for the fact that in the maximum of six
days between 28 May and 3 June when AMFAUNA-1 reported
the developments by S/W, something like the following
sequence of events must,have taken place:

this complexity the support and direction it needs, when the only
communication with theMrincipal agent is by secret writing. There
is never@tenough room in an S/W message for both the positive intelligen
reporting and the supporting operational detaile, and it is the lattar
