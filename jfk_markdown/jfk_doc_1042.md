MEMORANDUM FOR MR. ROSTOW
SUBJECT: Meeting of the Task Force on Viet Nam on June 19, 1961

_ intelligence Briefing

Among the interesting items reported in the intelligence
briefing was a response from Embassy Saigon on the Cambodian
border problem,. .Embassy Saigon did not agree with the view of
Embassy Phnom Penh that this is an insignificant problem. At
present, Saigon reports, Cambodia is used primarily-as‘a safe
haven by guerrillas in Viet Nam rather than as an area from
which operations are mounted. The Embassy provided specific’
information on VC activity in Cambodia which, it suggested,
should be shown to Sihanouk. There was also a report that the
Indian member of ‘the ICC ‘has stated in the ICC that that: body
should investigate subversion, This was said to have caused
the Polish member to. ask fora recess of the ICC in order to

- permit him to prepare a-reply. (This report, if confirmed,. is

in line with an earlier TDCS indicating that instructions

-long these” lines had gone” to the Indian’ member of the Ice. ).

It was also reported that on Friday there may have’ peen a
clash between Pathet Lao and South Vietnamese forces just in-
side Laos on the highway connecting Laos -and South Viet Nam.
‘(South Vietnamese forces have been in this area for some time.)

The. following’ table. on operations for May was also presented.’

Thé Local Currency: Costs Problen
Mr. Cottrell reported on the current: status of the-

problem of meeting the local currency sosts of the 20,000 man

increase. A message has beeri sent to aigon requesting the
Embassy to undertake negotiations ‘with=the GVN and offering
three. alternatives in descending, order of preference:

a. The U. s. would commit $5.1 million equivalent . in
piasters, provided the GVN ‘proceeds without. delay, with

mobilization and meets the balance of the local currency
costs’ from its own resources. :

-l-

“be. If the proposal ‘under a above is not adequate to
obtain GVN agreement, we would offer an additional $4.85
million in piasters. This is estimated to be sufficient
to cover local currency costs in 1961 of the call-up of
the additional 20,000 men.

ce. If neither of the above proposals roves accept-
able, the U.S. would offer an additional $4.55 million in
assistance in 1961 which, if the GVN would accept a dollar/
piaster rate of 73, would be sufficient to meet the ' Plaster
cost for 1961.

‘As of yesterday afternoon,-: no reaction had been obtained

from Saigon. In a long coriversation with Ben Wood, the Deputy
Director of the Task Force, Thuan was told before he left the
U. S..of our offer: under a above. On the basis of this offer,
he indicated that. he would send instructions to Saigon to in- .
itiate the call-up of the 20;000 men, even in the absence of a .
final agreement. This problen,.- therefore, seems on ‘its way
toward solution.

The Situation in Los in Relationship to South Viet Nam

A large part. of: the meeting was devoted to discussion of .

a draft memorandum that Cottrell read to the Task Force con-
taining his ideas with respect to the situation in Laos and
what should be done about it. You are generally familiar with
his ideas as a result of your conversation yesterday with hin,
I did not attempt to take detailed notes on the memorandum, pat
his proposal runs along the following’ lines.

Cottrell does not. believe that any arrangement. to create

‘-a neutral Laos will be viable. He does not believe that we
‘should withdraw in favor of the French in Laos. The French

“cannot be depended upon to do a good job and the reestablishment —

‘of their presence will be deeply resented throughout the former
Indo-Chinese states; The military situation in Laos is alarming.
‘The Pathet Lao are'now posing a serious threat in southern Laos.
-Cottrell. proposes that: we seize upon some plausible excuse to
break off. the Geneva Conference. The failure of the ICC to
stabilize the situation would provide such an éxcuse. He would
then introduce Thai special forces and “hunter-killer" forces
now being trained ‘in South Viet Nam into southern Laos in an _
effort to clean out the Pathet Lao "infection" there. In the
discussion of his proposal, the question was raised as to.
whether the introduction of U. S. forces would not be necessary.
Cottrell acknowledged that this was a real possibility and
emphasized the importance of our not letting our friends in
Southeast Asia down by refusing to use force if that ‘Should
prove necessary,

Members of the Task Force were asked for their .reactions

' to the paper. There was a rather surprising degree of agree-

M.

- agreement in the Task: Force).

: prompted Cottrell to produce his memorandu

ment that something along this line must be done or it will be
virtually impossible to deal with the situation in South Viet
Nam. (There was no State Department representative present at
the time except Cottrell himself.). The ICA member and the
representative of Jack Bell's office did raise questions as to
whether political and economic action by the Diem regime was
not a more important precondition to solution in Viet Nam than

military action in Laos.

I made the following ‘points about. the proposal: First, I
observed. that this would seem to/me to. raise important questions
of policy which had been considered and decided in the past at
the highest levels of government. I. indicated that I would be’
unable to take a personal stand on the issues raised,. I ex-
pressed.:some surprise about ‘the. apparent, unanimity of view that,
unless we undertake military action in Laos, it would be
virtually impossible to deal effectively with the situation in
Viet Nam. I said that, while I could see no objection to the
Viet Nam Task Force raising these questions, it seemed to me
that they. should be raised: much more clearly in the context of
the Viet Nam problem. That is,. the proposed memorandum should
make clear why the present situation in Laos will make it
difficult, if not impossible, to carry out an effective program
against the Viet Cong in Viet. Nam.. Cottrell agreed to take
account of this suggestion (with which there seemed to.be some

share his doubts with respect to getting the French back into

‘Laos. (I had. thought that this’ proposal -had -been dropped as a°

result of adverse reaction from various sectors. .) > The. Cottrell

' proposals, however, raise. very directly the question of U. S.

military intervention in Laos. It seems to me inconceivable

_that his objective’ could be achieved without such intervention.

The proposals also’ would have the effect, : it sédms ‘to. me,.of -
merging the war in Laos with the war in Viet Nam. I.do not

think that this would be a good: idea..

: I think that. there is a serious question as to whether the
situation in Laos,is not detéeriorating’so ‘wemecweaye that any .
itical solution will meé leave it as a serious source
into: both Viet Nam and Thailand. But I wonder
whether this question cannot be better reviewed in the context
of contingency planning for Laos itself. In-this: connection,

I do feel that the military contingency plan that'we have seen.
for Laos is based upon too narrow a contingency. -- i.°6:, a -

possibility that the Geneva Conference will be. prolonged in-
definitely and that meanwhile the: PL’ will take over Southern
Laos ‘piece by piece and bit.by bit“as it appears to be doing.
I wonder whether you want to check again with Alexis Johnson
on the status of contingency planning? I wonder whether it

isn't about time to have the NSC and the President review the
Laos situation? . .

‘Other Matters

I raised the question as to the next step in consideration
i of Diem's proposal“ for a 100,000 man increase in GVN forces... I
was told that the matter was being studied in Defense. It was
the view of the DoD representative that the possibilityof such
an increase was academic until some time in 1963 because it .
would take until then to raise the 20,000 men already. authorized
and the. 30,000 currently under consideration. (The 30,000 would
be a part of the 100,000 since Diem was using a 170,000 man base.).

‘I also raised the question of whether food supplies were
being cut off by the: Viet Congas suggested._to you by a
‘Vietnamese. I was told that the onl ce of Viet Cong
action in this area-was the recent seizure of seven barges —
carrying sugar. However, it was also stated that the GVN has
given this fear as“an explanation for reduction in rice ex-
ports. That is, the GVN has.withheld rice.from international
markets because of a fear that ‘the rice maybe needed in Viet
Nam-if the:VC. should begin to cut food supply lines, Thus it
may be related to the argument about GVN foreign exchange

. There seemed to be no great concern in the: Task. Force
with this as a current'real problem. Following. the meeting I
talked to the ICA representative about whether it would’ be de-
sirable to build up Vietnamese rice stocks to relieve them of
their fear that rice supplies may be cut_off and thus to.per-
mit them to sell more of their rice abroads ‘He indicated that
politically it was'very difficult toijustify export of rice to

_ Viet Nam which was itself a rice exporter. oo

, (Today I talked with Jack King of.CIA.(ONE) about“this
question,. He had not made'a specific study of it, of course,
It was-his impression that, while there was.some VC interference
with rice movements; the problem was not one of ‘independently
serious proportions. That is,.it was a.reflection of the .
general VC problem which was serious, but not in itself a cauze
for alarm, It was also his impression that GVN exports of rice
had been surprisingly well maintained.) - oo

Finally; I raised the question of what planning was . being
done to internationalize the border problem. In response
Cottrell simply referred to his plan for dealing with the.
situation in Laos. .Today I talked with Bob Cleveland in State
about the same points He referred to the arrangements that are
being made for a meeting of MAAG and USOM Chiefs of countries
in the area sometime in July’ at which the border problem,
among others, will be discussed. He also referred to the fact
that Ben Wood is currently working on a counter insurgency plan

_to cover ail of Southeast Asia. Defense had earlier been asked

to prepare such a plan but had failed to do so. (I finda
great inertia, apparently rooted in a basic lack of sympathy,

‘whenever I attempt to raise the question of finding some means

to involve the international comunity in the border question.
Neither Cottrell nor the State Department: representatives..seem
very much. interested; Have you ever discussed this question
with Alexis Johnson? I think it might be useful to do-so.)

Following the meeting I followed up with Cottrell. on the
conversation you had had with him in the morning, asking him
whether he didn't think it would be desirable to send Géneral
Taylor to South Viet Nam-to consider the request for -a 00,000
man increase and also to make surb that our military activities
in South Viet Nam were: sreally being reoriented. He reacted "
negatively . to ithis ‘proposal, taking the view that it was’ un-
desirable to continue sending missions out to inspect the work ~
of ‘people in the field.. In a later conversation with someone
else in State I got a much more favorable reaction to this idea.
The more I think about it the more I am convinced that it would
be highly desirable. I very much share your uneasy feeling about
the situation. : : ,
