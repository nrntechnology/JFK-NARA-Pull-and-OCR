Summary o
1... Victor RICO Galan is a prominont pro-Castro Harxist journale
ist assoctated with Politten a pro-Communist bi-wookly news magazine
In 1961. he wan
r ‘0 be & member. of the Periodistas Kexicancs Amigos do Cuba
and tho Committeo for Solidarity with. the Cuban Rovulution, As of
June 1965 he was reported to be a mombor of tha Fronte Eloctoral del
Pucblo (FEP). He was a founder of the Movimiento do Liboracion .
Nacional (MLN) of which he was the head of the hational prese and

"* Bropaganda committee as of 1962, RICO acted-as a Cuban agent in.
trips to Central and South America in late 1963 and carly 1964. His

.pro-Castro communist writings as well as his contacts with known
Soviet and Bloc intelligence personnel in Moxico during the: pant few
years atrongly suggest .. propaganda role under Journalistic cover on

what is listed in his basic biographic data, There is a possibility
ffairs in Costa Rica and B1 Balvador

in the poriod 1946-1948 and in Colombia in 1949-1950.

3. RICO Galan's prominence in Hexican leftist circlos haa beon
primarily intellectual, In an article in Siempre in March 1963 he
advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the truo
Adeology of Lazaro CARDENAS. RICO felt that this would provide the

‘Mexican loft with a political party truly responsive to the radtcal

tendencies of the 1910 revolution, Thig was naceasary, in RICO's
view, because the MLN was an action organization rather thaa a

“political party, whose momborship covered a political spectrum from

‘the Partido Revoluctonario Institucional (PRI) to the Partido
Conuntata do Mexico (PCM), and was therefore diluted in’effectivencas,
A naw party would reprosont a “third position": aSocialism in internal
afiaira and independonse of any bloc ia international affairs, With
guch a politics] action.am, wrote RICO, the LN would covolop
natarally into a broad national movement auch ag the FRAP in Chile,

4. Victor RICO Galan ig an ardent gupportar of Fidel CASTRO and
is reported to be a close friend of his, In order to gather natorial
for a biography of CASTRO, RICO, later joined by his vite, viaited
Cuba in October 1962 for about two months, He visited Cuba again
during part of May and moat of June 1963 when he Spent olght days with
CASTRO, five of thom at soa in CASTRO's boat, ostensibly to discuss
CASTRO'a recont trip to the Soviet Union and hig taiks witn XHRUSCHRY.
Ou thig visit the Cuban Government gave RICG a migsion to travel
througl Contral and South Anecrica to contact local connunistea and
guerrilla leaders and poraunde thea to begin immediately campaigns of
violence and terror.in order to take the pressure off the FALN in

greator

unity among the varioug loftist groups,

5. In the Fall and Winter of 1963 and late 1964 undertook thia
mission, Evon though a known leftist he possibly had somo arrangement
with the Moxican Government which may have gotten him spocial privi-

, loges and support ‘fram Muxicafi ombunaies in couatriea ‘whore ho visited.

In Guatemala RICO interviowod Genoral Enrique PERALTA Azurdia the
Chief of Govornmont and thon met Raul ALARCON Monsanto, military
‘training loader of the Partido Guatomalteco de Trabajo (PGT), who took.
him to moet and intorviow Marco Antonio YON Sosa an anti rogine
guerrilla loader; RICO possibly also met a (fnu) GOMBZ Ayau algo a
‘guorrilla leador. In Nicaragua ho mot with Alvaca RAMIREZ Gonzalos,
Socretary Goneral of tho Mobilizacion Republicana (MR) and a member of
the Contral Comitttoo of the Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN). In
Costa Rica ho mot with one of the MORA brothors,a guerrilla leader.

In Panama ho mot Hugo VICTOR, president of the Partido del Pueblo (Ppp),
and David TURNER, loader of the Vanguard of National Action (VAN), and
attempted to reconcile. them in their dispute for leadership of tho
revolution in Panama; ho also urged -an immediate program of sabotage
and violonce, » RICO went on to Venezuola to meat Argelia LAYA; he was
probably in contact with the HIR while there. He then wont to Brazil
whore he contacted Paulo SCHILLING,coordinator of the Popular Mobi-
lization Front, During this timo he may have gone to Cuba briefly and
returned directly to Brazil, Aftor a fow days back ia Moxico RICO
went to the Dominican Ropublic whore he attempted unsuccessfully to
ebtain photographs of Dominican guerrillas killed the month before,
probably to uso them for propaganda purposes. As 4 result of his
contact with the Agrupacion Politica Catorce Juaio (APCJ) in the
Dominican Ropublic ho was able to serve during the Dominican Republic
crisis of May 1965 ag a relay peint for material and instructions

from Cuba to the APCJ and nlyo as a. roporting channel from Juan B.
MEJIA and APCJ leadorg to the Cubau Intelligence Service and the
APCS's CASTRO Cuban loaderabip in Cuba, After hie return to Mexico
City RICO visited Cuba again ostensibly to interview CASTRO on his
most xocent trip to the Soviot Union and probably to report on his

mission.

6. RI€O Galan continued his intorost in the guerrilla struggle
and was reported to have entered Guatemaia clandestinaly in August
1964 and possibly several times before then as well, to vieit YON

Sosa and his guerrillas. In March 1966, aftor having returned from
Cuba the month before, he planned to travel again to Guatemala
elandestinely in order to investigato the disappearance of Victor
Manuel GUTIERREZ, leadar of the PCT and of the Guatemalan exile
community in Mexico, who had recently returned to Gustemala,

7. RICO's writings show an ardent support for tha guerrillas

2. Source Comment: In fact, the STUNL wee not formed by the Party since, when °
Tt Gas organized, there were no Communista agong the teachers end other

fe university workers. ‘The unton came into being ose result principally of the

: activities of a group uf teachers from Frefarotory School A. 1, and it had
the support of the then acting Rector, Alfonso Rangel Guerre, who saw in the
union posatbilities for creating probless for Eduardo Lives Villarresl, the
Governor of Nuevo Leon, It vss almost o yeor later that Rolando Guzezan, Tomas
Goninlez de Luna, and Huracio Salazar Joined the FCM, but. their influence in
the union connot be attributed to this fact. The union haw continued ‘to extat

i because it hes ewintained ite octivities within legal bounds, devonding atnigua |

a : vagee and ioproved vorking conditions. ICH influence in the union ia hegitetdle ;

since, in edditicn to Guaran, Gonsales, oml Salazar, thare ere only four‘or ive
