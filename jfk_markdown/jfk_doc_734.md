MEMORANDUM FORs Deputy Director of Central Intelligence
“oun getr Crusade for Freedom and Nattonal Infomation Pureau

1. On January 10th I called your attention to the fact that
the National Infomation Pureau, a reputable investigation agency
which conducts inquiries {nto charitalle organizations and alvises
large donors, had given an advorse recomicndation on the Crusade
“for Freedom (see Attachment 1). Tals catter has now risen again.
It may be that 1t would be ulse to undertake a iigh-level approach
to the Bureau throug: yourself or Genoral Smith, for tho following

Treayons

According to an acreement with us and with the State
Department at our recent mcetings, Crusade for Freedom will bank
heavily this yoar on donations frou corporations. They ave now
discovered that these corporations rcly to a great extent on the
National Information Eurcau's acvice. Several corporations have
indicated thes, according to their practice, they cannot give to
the Crusade unless it nas the tlessing of the Eureau, and you will
note in Attachment 2 that one puch corporation -- Barnes Nanufactur-
ing Company of Mansfield, Ohio == has written to the Crusade citing

its doubt.

2. Meantimo, members 7f the Crusade have rac conversations
with D. vaul Heed, Executive Director of tne National Infomation
Bureau (see Attachment 3) and he tas insisted tiat ae cannot report
that the Crusade 1a3 cat the basic stendards in pailanthropy until
his Standards 7 and # are met. Tuese are the suilication of an
annual audit and of a detalied annual budget, the prime reyuiroment
being the disclosure of totals.

3. You may want to read this Attachment 3 with care but I
cannot myself see any manner in wiica we can meet these standards.
Tierefore, I believe that it may be necessary to make the ap roach
to the National Information Hursan described above.

ORIGIN AND PUI? SEs «American Committee on United Purope, Ine, was inoorsor.ted in New
'y 1949. Stated puroose of tu- Comalttes ta two-folde

York, FetFuary

In Furope to *1, eneoursge the ideo of unity asd lend asaurance thet a

unified Furopo will have the aunvort and friendshiv of tie people of the

United Stetezy de give desporutely needed finsnoial sup, rt to groups - am
such a8 the Zuropean Movaasnt - working in Furope on dehalf of unity.”

Ia America to 81. give Amsricans a better understanding of the steps to-
ward unity whieh Furope hes already undertasenj <. encourage elvic, edu-
cations: and other grouvp to study their implicsticng and the aeans by
which dmaricon policy can further tte wergy ani finally, 3. as specific

issues arise, the Comnitter wil. point out what we Anericany cun do, ao
individuals and as 2 nation, to help furore unalto and thua to help therselves.”

By vay of beoxground information, the Comnitteae strted in its early days:

"Despite Europe's recuperati.n from tne visibie effectr of wartine dom
vastation, »ntiquated nations: barriers t. unity end progress atili in-
vite dissster for ali countries. A continent divided into seventeen se-
parete, conflictin,, soli.tical ont economic vockets vresents a weak and
vulnerable flank, perilous to world pe.ce ani securitye

®Four decades of bloodshed ani economic deteriozreti.. have tauznt the neoples
of Furope th t survival is tmcosoibie witncut unity. As never before, they
h:ve bonded together - etnteruen, trade unionists, business leaders, church~
fgom and educators in a dosen nations - in the soverent for furopean unity,
Althcuch determined to accomplish Union, they foce many obstacles.

"Convinced of our staxe in the success af their work, the Anerican Caanittes
on United Europe believes th t Americen eusvort and epoourecesent can be
decisively helpful to the realivationd® this objective. Leaders {n rurooe
heve confirmed this belief, ona insist th:< tne time for maxious eftort {5

at hand,®

PROGRAY aND ACTIVITIFSs The Aserican Comnittee on Calted Furooe desortbes itself as "in
thorougn agreement with Winston Churenill"s assertion thot 'We must spread the knowledse
that this thin, ts realy possible...We must ereste a elim te of cofaion.'” It will also
Speok to avoid pleading for eny single precorerived scheme or precise pattern for

Puropean Union, conseious trot the nature of Union must evolve from the nerds and aspira~

tions of the peoples who vill unite.” .

HORVAT, Pavie

y Pavle Horvat is of Slovenian orifin, atout 50 years old and was
born in the Prlekija district near the Hunearian border (formerly a -
part of. the Austro-Hungarian monarchy).

Horvat became known durin: the thirties throush his numerous
~ . manifestos and posters by which he attempted to organize his ow os
w . political movement. This "movement" was labeled various names at
pe ° different times. At one time it was sinrly referred to as a "peasant

movement," at another time as the "Slovenia Secticn of the Croatian
Peasant Party," and still later as an “inderendent Slovenian peasant
niovement." He never had, however, any following and never set up his
own electoral lists. On the other hand, it is true, that the Croat
Peasant Party of Dr. “acek considered him as one of its trustees in

Slovenia for a short period.

He earned his living as a farmer. He also had a small village
-erocery shop and occupied himself in his district with "interventions,*
that is, performing all types of secretarial services for the peasants
of the area, A.ong other things, he undertook to organize the
transportation of the seasonal. workers who went to France and
Germany during the harvestins months, He had difficulties with the
home authorities and police in this respect and had to ap-ear before
the courts on a number of occasions. :

At the beginning of the war he fled to Sagreb, Croatia, at that
time the Independent Croat State (Nazi purpet recime) of Dr. Pavelic.
There he set up a small office for the relief of Slovenian refugees
but it never reached any large proportions. He was not connected
with the Refugee Comittee which handled the main relief work (Cne
source tointed out that the mere fact that he xvas able to establish
an office and function i:. Zagreb during the period meant that he was
at least passively acceptable to the Nazi regime. :

As far back as 1935 he is !mown to hsve misrepresented himseif
as a "peasant leader.” :

After the war Pavle Horvat fled to Austria where he a-ain claimed
to be a Slovenian peasant leader and atterpted to whip up propaganda
for the creation of a srecial "peasant group," axong the Slovenian
refuzees; he failed comleteiy. He vas uncble to find followers in
a single carp to forn such a group, and the refugees refused to attend
his meetings. In addition he is known to have boasted that he was
acting on behalf of Hr. hacek and the Internstional Peasant Union,
thoush he was mancated by neither. The Allied authorities were
finally forced to intervene and brin, a stop to his activities since
they were causing discontent among the refugees and disorders in the

DP campse.
14-00000 .
en RE er ORE RII, METI BREN ot

_. In July 199, Horvat wrote the Honorable Josech C, Grew in care. |.
of the National Committee for a Free Europe introducing himself as 4
the Representative of the Nemocratic Slovenes and President of the :
Interrational Peasant Union for Evrore, and suzesting that he join \
forces vith the Comuittee in the common struc-le against Communism.
--In return for a trip to the United States he offered to bring 2
large confidential rerort on his activities to date and present a
scheme for successfully sunpressing cozriunism ard delivering the
sutjugated nations in the shortest possible time. He was informed
“ that the Fund was confining its activities to refugee leaders already
. reziding in the United States and that the pronosed visit was ~
. : Aimpozsible at that time.

, Horvat has recently announced his forthcoming arrival in the

~ United states, Several Slovenian and Croatian newspapers in this
country have received articles (which he wrote himself) glorifying
his past and present activities, None of them, so far, have taken any
notice of these articles with the excertion of the Croat separatist
(pro-ustashi) paper, "DANICA," published in Chicaro. Supposedly .
Dr. “-acek was highly amused on reading the article describing the
great "Slovene peasant leader.”

Nobody in Slovenia in pre-war days would have considered Favel
Horvat as a person to be taken seriously in public life. He is
considered by a number of sources a political impostor and as
personally unethical, Neither the International Peasant Union for
Europe, of which he claimed to te president, nor the Denocratic
Slovenes, of which he is a repres .ntative, is considered a levitimate
organization. The Director of the Fund's Yugoslavian Research and
Informaticn Desk was the editor of a daily paper in Slovenian for
eleven years before the war. He never net iiorvath, seldom heard of
him and his perer, as far as he knew, never took notice of him or his
activities,

Dear Toms

With reference to the ~tephen Maineayk ea.2 wich Sam discussed

“ with you during your recent visit, several questi.as have arisen
concerning the broader arpacts of the type of activity Matneayk was

undertaking in ad‘ition to hiv PFE duties, .

Specifically, wo woulr! like to know what sort of earloymant
contract RFF emloyeco enter into with RFF, If ro.sible, ve wuld
like a corny of a ty-ival eontr ct, e are intcre:tes in nowlng
vhat restrictions, if any, ara rlaced on enrloye:s' outsice interests
or activities while e:ployed with fté, particularly 15 they would
eprly $e a case auch as Mainesy's. ‘e would also like to hive
inforratioa on the tyre of security a-rearent pre-ently in use
betveen RFF and its exploycce.

There are attached sev'ral rspers bearing on the “alnozyt cases
forvarded with a report on the satter, which wio prepared for our
+ friends scross ‘he strest. This recort wis to the reneral ef:ect
a that the American m.naper of the Jalaburg of!ica of Radio Free
Burope has been deeply conearnet over events artaing from Mainesyk's
recent death, ‘hile lo-kin~ tertuch the personal eff-cts of the
deceased, he fount eviderce thit Maincayk had acce-ted roney for
the purrese of -asaisting indivicuals to escare frees: behin? the Ire
Curtain to the U.u.7one of Austria, The RFF manacer was further
disturosd to find that the entruste+! funds were not Listed anong the

RANDUP GOR THE REONRD

“SUBJECT: Connittee for Russian Liberation

1. I called Bob Joyce in the State Department yesterday
and asked him whether in nis view the State Department would
object,.to placing the new Committee for Russian Liberation under
the Crusade for Freedom. I mentioned particularly a possible
caveat of the State Department -- that wo might be expanding the
Crusade at the very time we aad agreed at a series of meetings -
held recently that we would cut down its activities.

2. Joyce said that the avrecrient with State was as to
method and scope of Crusade publicity and activity and that the
addition of the new Comittee under Crusade cover would not by
any means‘abropate this agreement. He said that we could so
ahead and count upon the State Department's approval. I asked”
him whether he would like a menorandum to this effect or whether
he would Like to consult others in the State Department and he
caid no, that this was unnecessary, that we snould go ahead.

MEMORANDUM FOR: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR POLICY COORTINATION
- SUBJECT NCEE

1. For quite some time the etaf! officers of this diviaion concerned
with utilising the racitlities of the NC:i and with-oxploiting the
Albanian, Bulgarian, and Rumanian emigrations have been aware of a lack
of adequate coordination between our own activities and those of the %
NCFE statf. in conjunction with those +I Civision officers responsible
for handling our relations with that organisation, we have atteapted
te explore the problem in order to find a solution which could be
considered realistic and practical.

2. The difficulty. lies not only in the communication system between
OPC and NCFE, which does not always tranamit, at exactly the right tine,
the right ideas from cne organisation to the proper individuals at the
right level .n the other. Althowsh uc Havs maintained very. close contact
, both informally and through formal channels, only too often we have not ;
been in a position to learn why NC°E staff officers have made a givon decis- t
ion in regard to some emigre organization in which wa had an interest; and :
on the other hand, our desirea and needa have not always been fully under- fo
stood or accepted in New York. Again, it has happened that we were '
ignorant of developments that closely affected ovr operations until it
was too late for us to maxe o-r influence felt, and, correspondingly,
. it must be admitted that we have ourselves pushed ahead with courses of
action without adequately brieting the NCFL. Tne most extreme case in
point known to us concerns the Rumanian exigration, where we and NCFE
are now pursuing conilicting policies. he upshot of thia has deen the
gradual development of a situation wherein Orc is supporting an organisa-
tion, the NCkc, which is not fully responsive to it.

- 3. Thia situation is not regarded by us as reflecting any fundamental
inadequacy in NCFc, or as presenting any ingoluable difficulty. ‘There
exists a problem in staff interrelationship which ean and should be
resolved by a reform in our organigational ap.rosch, The goal toward which
we believe we should work is one where OrC communication with NCIE would
de channelled directly along a single high-level line which wo-ld firmly 1
tie in AcrC's office with thit of the head of the other organisation, :
Iseas, suggestions, information, etc. would flow, in the regular channels,
up from the 0?7C working level to AT?C's office for review ans transmiasion
to the top office of NC*s, and flow down from there through YFS's usual ;
channels to the proper individuals in its.operational machinery. Yersonal
contacts between individuals at a lower level in the two organisations i
would frequently occur to supplement this usual crannel, when security ‘ ~
permitted, but should be in the hands of responsible personnel who
understand the OPC policies involved.

Because his sole task-would be to represont A'rc's interests, he should

tive charged with exysleining end representing CIA's intereets, functioning
as & chsnnel of inforzation about the organization to which he is
accredited, and controliing all liaison between the two. In our opinien,
the establishment of thia post, with a suitable individual assigned to the
2Job, would immediately correct most of the present difficulties, and would
provide the necessary machinery within which a fully satisfactory relations
stip botween CPC and \C:= eould develop.

_DISCUSSTON
“T Orde Obicgtive National Goupeils Diviss

The National Councils Division of the National Corm-ittee for a
Free Lurope was created on 3 April 1950 by resolution sf the Loard of
; Directors, The underlying principle, as stated in the Declaration of
: Policy in June 1950, was to aid the "non-Fascist and non—Cormmunist
: leaders in thoir peaceful offorts to prepsre the way towerd the
' restoration in Eastern Europo of the social, politicel and religious
i libertios in which they and we believe." The councile were to function
i as "representative, harmonious and effective croups* and, as such, to
play a part in the strurgle against Commnise: in Lastern iurope. They
: weve not to be considered as governments in extle nor as ence in then-
selves.

National Cornmittees and Panels,*® as supported by HCFE, were to
fulfill a two-fold function: as 1) avert instrunents, they were to
a) serve as a symbol of unity both in this country and ebroad, b) provide
a reservoir of "name" manpower for propacanda use, e) supcly general
Propacanda policy advice, and ad) su EB with both ceneral and
Specific intellicence with respect hozeiand activities ami personal-
ities. as 2) covert instruzxcnts, they were to servo as a cover for
Operations undertaxen by CIA aimai at coxtatting Soviet oppression in

the satelite states,

*These ares the zstonian, Latvia: and Lithuanian Punels, which were set
up with the help of CFs and which Ninction well.

I keenly regret to inform you that, upon further reflection and
upon the basis of information which has recently’come to my attention,
l consider it inadvisable for um ito address your Psychological Stratezy
Conference, and that I find it necessary to ask you to release me from
speaking at your meeting on Saturday. “hen J was first asked to cpeax
about the significance of National Comittee for a Free Europe and the
activities of: Kadto Free Europe, £ understood that the Conference world
discuss propaganda and peychological warfare, I wephe from the relesse nz
issued by your -o fice, that among tle purposes of the conference nre the
presentation of definite plans of action to increase resistance mover#nte,
and to aid the peoples of the Soviet nation and the Satellite States to
overthrow their regimes, .as well as to eetablish a continuing orgarization
to carry out. the programs developed at the conference, This release alto
indicates that there will be full and cperi discussion of euch matters and
that persons purporting to represent underground movements in Poland, tre
Baltic States, Russia, Chins, Kore*, etc., will take part in discussions,

It ie my personal view that it would be unwise to discusssusttere of
this sensitive and provocative character in open meetings, particularly
where programs of specific action are considered. It seems to me that
public duscussions of such matterc end revelations of plans and prograss

THE “VOICE” AND RADIO FREE EUROPE
COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER

Both Are Indispensable |

1 .

“ W hat's the difference between the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe?" “Why
is it necessary co tiave buth the Voice and Radio Free Europe?” These are frequent questions
asked of General Clay and the other leaders of the Crusade for Freedom.

The Voice and Radio Free Europe are both vitally needed if we are to win the
Cold War. .

They are completely separate organizations. Each performs a distinct function in the fight
against the gigantic Soviet propaganda machine. .

The Voice speaks with the authority of the U. S, Government. It is financed by Govern-
ment funds.

Radio Free Europe was set up by private citizens. Ic is financed by millions of individual
contributions co the Crusade for Freedom.

Voice is World Wide

The Voice is a worldwide network, broadcasting in 46 languages over 75 transmitters. ft
is the only American voice heard in the Soviet Union. Its 120 indiwidual daily programs of
news, music, roundtables, comimentaries, documentaries, service programs, etc., have a potential
audience of 300,000,000 listeners. - .

Radio Free Europe is much smaller. It concentrates on the captive countries behind the
Iron Curtain: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania. Its cransmit-
ters are in Western Europe.

The Voice speaks for the American people, spreading the truth about democracy, giving a
true picture of. life in the United States, and spiking Moscow's lies about us, It repcrts in full
on official American acts and documents, presents news and world developments from our
poinc of view.

But Voice is nor limited to Government pronouncements; it regularly reflects American
opinion as expressed in our press and radio. In a friendly way—with programs of informa-
tion and service—it promotes a better understanding of the United Srates in Europe, in Latin
America, the Far Ease and the Near East. .

om Exiles Speak Over RFE

Raugio Free: Europe, on the other hand, does not portray America. It concentrates largely
on what is taking place within the slave. countries. Over its transmitters Poles speak to Poles,
Hungarians to Hungarians, etc. They speak'as “the voice of Free Poland,” “the voice of Free
Hungary.” etc. They look at their people's problems through their own eyes. :

“ RFE programs specialize in identifying and denouncing Communist informers and collab-
orators, sending back messages from escapees, and exposirig the corruption and crimes within
the Red regimes.

In cheir broadcasts to behind the Iron Curtain, the Voice and-Radio Free Europe have es-
sentially the same aims: co keep alive the hope of liberation; to let listeners know thac they
have not been forgotten; ¢o stiffen their resistance against theie Communist oppressors; to ex-
pose the fraudulent basis of authority upon which the Moscow-dominated regimes rest.

Both combat Communism and the persecution of- religion and denial of human rights.
Both report the superior industrial power and fighting potential of the free world over the . 5

: . 1951 Year of Progress for “Voice”

D uring the past year the Voice of America:

1, Stepped up daily programming from 30 to 50 hours daily. i

2. Made progress in overcoming Soviet jamming. :

3. Increased its broadcasts to behind the Iron Curtain, adding the “splinter” languages of
Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Tatar, Turkestani, Larvian, Lithuanian and Estonian. |

4, Inaugurated programs to Albania, Finland, Israel and Portugal in their respective languages; :

: to China in two additional dialects, Swatow and Amoy; to Japan and South and Southease .

t Asia in Hindi, Urdu, Thai, Burmese and Malayan.

5. Became more outspoken and hard-hitting. One of the principal chemes was the support of
the UN effort to ‘repel the Chinese and North Korean Communist aggression in Korea.
Major attention was given to exposing the fraudulent Soviet “peace” drive.

6. Began work on the “Ring Plan” approved by Congress, which calls for a network of power-
ful relay bases girdling the globe.

7. Created * “Vagabond” '—a ship equipped with a transmitter, so that radio broadcasts may
be relayed from shipboard.

8. Received 318,000 letters from overseas listeners—an increase of 35¢:, over 1950.

9. Need'ed the Communists so successfully thac Radio Moscow and Soviet regional stations
doubled their attacks against the Voice. :

Dear Abbotts

I have just been inferned over the telerhone
that Earle iiogersa. of Counsel Services, Inc., has called
@ meting of the Crusade for Freedom Covrittee in this
e@ity, and has falled to consult me in any way in this,
TB ters

This hes resulted, as usual, in cousing
utter confusion in the minds of everyone, and bodes no
cood Yor the Crusade in this city nor for *he sponsoring
orpreipation ~ the National Co:nmi twe for a Froe Europe,
for widch the Crusade is operating. In your letter of
Docemter 7, 1951, to tt, Hulbert T. Bicse:le, Chairman of
the crusade for Freedom in the District of Columbia, you
desigrated mi as, Diractor of tho Bauabhington, LC, office.
AS I lave received no instristions from you to the con=
trary, I have presumed this sltuation to te continuing.

The fact that ur. Rogers would proceed ina
mitter of this kind without co:sultaticn with tnis office,
and without being co:misaloued by you to undcrtake such a
moeting, is most disturbing. This ie the sort of thing
that will really kill the Crusade for Freedow in this city.

I shall hope to discuss this matter with you
when in New York on Thursday.

Dear Allens . -

This letter concerns the matter which I discussed with you
briefly last week. :

For some months past both the officers end directors of the
NCFE have been cencerned es to what protective steps could be taken
in behalf of foreign naticnsls working fer Radio Free Furope in
Germany under conditions wrich might arise in certain eventualities.

I attech copy of s letter becring on this matter which was
written by Lung to Gates Lloyd on November 5, 1951. It gives a
concise cutline of the problen and suggests a solution cf the some.
To date, es fer as I know, we have not been able to secure any
assurances thet this is being teken care of. If, us we have been
informed, the Army suthorities in Germany ere willing to help upon
receiving clesrance from the Department of Defense, we feel every
effort should be made ta implement this promptly.

Apart fr-m the very res) present und potential future value of
in the group, the Committee feels thot it has

the foreign nationals i
a definite morsl obligsti-n to seek the sure degree of assist nce
and protecticn for them as would be efforded United States citizens

under the conditions referred to.

Persorally, I feel this obligation is e broader cne which ex-
tends tc this Government cs well.

Last Tiursda; when ve ware discussing this question in New
York, Jee Grew was ruch interested ard seid he would be glsd to cssist
in any way possible. We ali felt, hevever, thot this is not a metter
whien the Comittee can t up direct with the Defense Depertrent or
other Government egencies here end thet 1t enn only te breught to a
proper solution through set. n the part of the Director or yourself.

Pleese be good enough te trke tile matter under consider: tion
end give us the benefit of yrur edvice, :

MENORANDUN OF OONVFRGATION

Present were Messrs. Jackson and washburn of HCFE, Kesurs. Sarrett,
doyee, Levine, Sargeant and Kohler fran State, aut Messrs. Dulloa,
Wisner, Liayd and Braden from CIA. The neeting vas neld in

Kr. Barrett's office on 17 Jenuary at b:30 pa.

ONCIUSNN: That the Crusade for Freedom organization should continue.

The following is a tranccript of Mr. Bradan's notes of the
meoting.

C. D. led off, adnitting the frustrations tnat a long campaign
en the Crusade for Freedom caused to the State Department and spg-
gested the following prograns

le A leday dell-ringing campaign in ail cltios.
2. Direct mail to corporations.

At this point, Hr. kashturn interjected to aay that be wuld need
about two weeks of "low drums’ promotion before tie i-day campaign.
Jackson went on to assy that ‘undor such a schame there would be no
time on tha part of the chaiman for a bulld-up of invidious comari-
sons in the cress. At Jackson's request, Hr. sashbumn passed around
a@ Crusade publication entitled "The Voice of amarica - 195) + A Tear
of Frogreas®. Tois brochure, wiich in four pages :raisea highly the
work of the Voice of Amories, is to be mailed ty tue Crusade to ita
chief contritutere.

Hr. Barrett then mada the following points:

1. The National Camittee for a Free Europe grew out of the .
idea of helping refugoes and of giving tien a volee. It has chmged
over the years to a huge operation wita many now ideas, end the
Crusade for Freedom cano along as a cover necesal ty.

2. He asked unsther the demands of funderalging had not begun
to make less effective the primary Job of holring refugees, whethor

tho tail == Crusade for Froodom e= is not wagi:ing the dog. He
renarked that in a conversation with Alan Valontine ho hed found

that Valentine ia inclined to agree with hin,

3. Against Hr. Wachburn and the Crusada for Freedom, he had
only one complaint. ‘They were too good, too big-time. They made
auch an effective appeal taat the recipients couid not avoid running
down the competitor. Ho stated as ity opinton tat tao Crusade vas
Joopardizing a muiti-million dollar operation -- the Volce of Americas <=
and might even be jeopardizing anotier multi-million dollar operation —
Radio Freo Furope == for the. sake of raising three million dollars.

Lh. fle thought balloons ond some other oporationa done by tho
Comeittes wero best done by private means,

5. Ho leaned toward going back to tho beginning and looking
at the Crusade as purcly a cover oporatisn and mt an attempt to . 1
Yralse large funds and making a lot of hoopla. He augzeuted that the .
Crugado siould raise only enough money and moke only enough of a
csmpaign to provide a dignified cover. Ha suggested mall colicita-
tion, magazine advertisements, the publioleing of two or three largo
enonynous gifts, all without hign-prossure. Then he said, "Let's
get on with the main Job of radio and refugees.”

Mr. Dulles asked whether this danger to the Votes wap so great.
"Didn't you get more money tals year?" Barrett's answer tas "Ho®
and he pointed out that there was no damage done to the Yolce by the
Ceusede tais year insofar-as finds wore concerned but he feared the
feture. Dulles asked waetlior we couldn't work out the timing of the
Crusade so that thore wuld be no interferences on tho hill. Hr. Barrett
did not directly ansver the question. ite sald the cover was bad. Too
many people already lmow the truti sbout the Crusade and ne is vorried
about {t. He said it surprised sin that it worried nis more than it
worried Mr. Dulles. A large campaign raises tho question, he sald.
of iow all the work 15 dona on suca a call amount of money. Ho
thought the Crusade called attention to itvelf as cover.

Howland Sargeant asked Jackson to answer this question, "f
Wiat various uses aro the Crusade7® Jackson Minted then as follows

* 1. Cover. He agreed with fr. Narrett thet the Crusade both
increased end decreased tie security danger.

2. It bringa in nonay.

3. It edscates and interests izaricana in the whole prodles
of psychological warfare and propaganda and dose oo fore than any~
thing else tuat is managed ty tne Goverment or by private funds.

the Voleo ky publicising the need for communtoating te people in
alavory. .

Sargpant thourht point 3) vas tho most inportent. He asked whether
the Cruaade couldn't be tled in with this point. Jackoon said, "Yeo,
amt wo oro atarting wit this issue of the Cruneler publicizing the
Yolco.® Washturm added that 25 million contrita:tors, counting this -
year's and last yearto contributions, may prevent cutting dow the
operation so Farrett sugcesta. They will raiso a lot of queations.
Barrott disagreed and repeated his sugeestion of a oneenonth operation
confined to mnagasine adverticing and dirvet mail. Jackson axked atout
the magatine acvertiaing. le said you had to write copy for magazine
atverticing and tho copy would have to advertise hadio Freo Furoje.
Rarrett onowored, "You can control the copy on maragine ads. There
is a lot of tine allowed for going over thom carvfully before they got

into print.®

Wachturn repeated several tines that tt wuld te a creat ahano to
Yes the Crusade go. Jackson said the Crusade gave a real lift to
exileg not only hero but abroad.

Rohlor said he had deen tiinking about tho prohlem and had te
suggestions to make:

1. Could we oxhort people to give a dollar to fatto Pree Furopo
and at tha sme time to write a letter to their Ongressmen backing up

the Voioo of Asorica? ,

8. Ould tho Radio Advisory Qmnrittes of the Voloe of Amorica
tees up edith tho Crusade to help with general publicity?

Jackson enovered the first question "No". He thought that would be

dangerous. To the somnd question, he eald "Yen®. He azain outlined
big ddea for a campaicn calling for education on a genersl paycholegi-
egal warfare progres with o final request to contribute to the Crusade.

Hr. Pulles again acked Nr. Darrett atout tie financial problens
and the timing of his request to the hill, Barrett said he vould hsve
the noet difficulty fron January to July. hasbbarn eaid, "Then we'll
wen a easpaign in September only and there’1) be no horn-blowing until

a year mrely to conduct a twoeweek cazpaign would waote many good

ments tine. Barrott agreed that a two-weck campaign wouldn't keop

the organisation alive. ‘

Sargeant askod Lf there wore mot other ideas tmich could be fed
through the Crusade macninery, thus asking nore conatructive ues of

it.

Varrett ratsed the question 2f internationalletng tho Crusade
effort. Jackson replied that thers was an sbortive Yronen project
whnioh he thought would shortly fall flat on ito face. The British,
he thought, would chortly make a final dealcion as t whethor to go
abhoad with an exile prograa or not. Ho seencd dublous that thay
would decide to do m. ia montianed Joan Paul David and saix et
Liberte as the only foreign operation in this field whicn had any
eperk to it. Barrett agrocd tut asked uhether or not some Furepeana
eouldn't be put on the Hoard of Directors. Dulles replied that thie
wae vary difficult, that they couldn't attend neetings for one thing.
Parrott said, "Couldn't there be an annual mecting simply ao a front,
a9 csmouflage?" .

Jackson said that NCFE did get tnvalved in European organisations,
that they had clone affiliations uit: tne Furopean hove.ent, with the
Pree Trade Union Comittoo in bdle, wth the International Journalists,
wits Strasbourg University, and all the radio progress were reaching
the point where thay were thought of as prograns belonging to the people
to whem they wore broadcast. NCFs had, no thought, internationalised
a great deal and in 4 very natural way. A board of foreig directors
would epoil that naturai process by setting up an obvious p:oney.

Washburn again raised the arrunont of timing the campaipn to toke
plaoe only in September. ‘There waa no direct msvonee te this sugees-
tien.

Sargeant, referring again t> the uso of tho invicible asseta
mentioned by Dulles, tought that if tao Crusade continued it sould
be planned not primarily to raise funds except as cover. Attention
ghould bo focuaed on:

1. Ine development of unterstandings the battie for tne minds of
men, .

2. Two or three concroto tings wiicn private ecitisens could do
in this battle.

to bashturn he said, "Abtott, put your alnd to work.” iia thought we

Borrett again raieed t.« cover proble: and his dlisvatisfaction |
with the Crusade as cover. ‘niles equlained tnat this was a problem
that had to be lived with. .

Zackeon once more attemted to get agrecaent of the group on

1. ‘The Crusade to eratiave.

2. To bogin not eariier tuan wepteuber and to be of very snort

Main Post Office
Washington, D. C.

Deor Allent

At a mecting af the Executive Committee of the Board of N.C.F.F.
held on Jemury 3rd Lett, the wembers felt that two of the subjects
diecunsed at that tise should be called to your ettention so that you
might know the views of the Coumittee in the event these mattcra were

broupht befors you 24 £ later date.

The first cesecrns e@ sugyection which epperently came informelly
from McCluny end otm-rs in Amcomfree, that 1f mesns could be fourd to
do s0, they be allowed +o use some of the R.P.L. facilities in Gerneny
for certein of their troedcasts. Since this catter was not brought up
asa formal request, 20 action wae teken by the Comittee, but the in-
dividual member: unzsinously exprecsed the opinion thut this would be
moct Inadvisuble ani thut they would be opposed to the use of R.F.F.
fecilities for thiz gorpoee even if time and frequencies wers aveil-
eble, which 1s not s* €11 certrein. Since Amcomfrce is an orgenizetion
in which you have direct interest 1t seems cdvigsble to acqunint you
with our feelinge tz. tre gatter should you or.your organization be
épproeched by McClusy or others on this subject. Without going into
details at this time es to the reasons for our feeling.in the matter,
our muin concern 13 thet Amcomfree's targets sre envirely different
from those in which ve are interevted, ond from the standpoint of
operation from Germ-r e041 they ere far less likely to be agreeable to
BONN. We ere fearfrl of putting in Jeopardy 2 presently successful
operation and four t- five million dollsrs of etuipu:nt by the intro-
duction of s project weich we fuel should be kept separate and apart.

The other m-tter which cme up for forme] ection involved the
edvieshility of undertzking Poligh programing in Germany, and the
Executive Committee trenimously cyreed tht R.F.f2. ehould proceed
vith the plens prezexted. In brief, such plens cz11 for the origine-
tion of from three t< four hours deily of Poligh progriming from Munich
beginning on or about Mey 1, 1952, and the introduction of same 50 to
60 Poles into the city of Munich for work with Be F.E. to carry out

this schedule.

Since this is e xzJor step in the development of R.F.E. progrem-—
ing end more particul-rly becsuse of the fortheening negotictions be-
tween representatives of N.C.F.M., HICOCG, srt BOKH, it wos felt thet
you should be formelly sdviced of this decision. The Executive Com-
mittee also wanted ts go on record to the effect tant while they
retlized the riske involved, sffirg:tive action wes teken as & result
of opinions given by Messrs. Byroede, Kellermern trd Strauss of the
Geruzn Desx, Departa<crt of State, end by Mesers. Stone, Lewis and
Eoerner of HICOG. I= exswer to the specific cuestion "Would in your

For your further information, the operuting officers of R.P.E.
in chargs of the project for this Polish programing, havu been directed

to proceed slowly in implementing the action of the Executive Committee

Desr Allen:

at the Grusece Board Moetiny: last Friday, C... reported in detail on our
meeting in Ed Sarrott's office.

This was followed by a cenernl discussion of the nature aad scope of the
1952 Grussée program. Briefly, there was agreemcnt thet the program in
192 should be considerably reduced in scope, that the emphasis should be
taken off publicity and placed on fund-raising with the promotional period
bteing reduced from two montha to two or three weeks. . It was felt that a
direct mail campaign to owr present list of givers -~ plus a thorough
solicitation of corporntions -- would be desirable.

There was discussion also of a one-night house-to-house canvass, nation-wide,
on Constitution Day next September. Mr. Foole suggested that, in addition to
Radio Free Burops, the 1952, Crusade might place euphasis on the newly formed
Free Europe University in Exile at Strasbourg, France. General Clay -
recomended that the Advertising Council's assistance in the new c:mpaign

de sought at the earliest moment,

I have reported: the above to John Damewood -- elso your instructions on the
subnission of a budget. :

$450,000 was the estimated figure which we mentioned to you as adequate to
cover the entire operation. After careful ctudy and ell possible paring,:
the total budget submitted herewith amounts to $488,991... this to be
spresd over the eleven remeining months of 1952. :

Of this total, $222,270 would fall in the present fiscel year (5 months at
$44,454 per zonth).

The total budgeted figure is slightly more than a cuarter of the cost of tne
195. campaign. With tho ground work that has been laid during the past two
drives, it shoulé realize at least as muck as the campaign just completeds,
altrough this, cf course, is difficult to estinate.

We hava had further talks with the VOA people, and the "Crusader® supplenent
devoted to the Voice will a pear next week. They secued very pleased about
it. :

Best regards,

Sincerely,

few

SUBSECT s Plana for talargement of the. Pree University in Frile

REPERTaT% 6 Letter fram Rozal Tyler to pner of 15 Lacenbder 175)
‘
1. At a aseting at the [2C1's house, Vashington, 0D. ., on tunday
morning, 13 January 19752, “r. Royal Tyler diecussed with Foaors. he Wo

Mulleg, fH. ‘lates Lloyd anid Thozas w. Eraden, the present plans of tho
Trustees of the FIIE as presented at their eseting in Yew York last week.

2. Reyarding the administration of the tiniversity, ¥r. Tyler reported
that Hr. Mewitt C, voole's resignation effective 31 March 1952 had been .
formally eccepted by the Trustess and Ur. cevering ‘yson had bean elected
Viee vrasident with full executive powers as of the present. Or. haleola
Devie haa not, sceording to Dr. tyson, proved an effective administrator
and hao been relieved of all non-acadenic dutios as vell os neabership on

the Awards Committee.

3. Pegarding the future expansion of the 'iniversity whieh Fr. Tyler
had reviewed at some lenrth in the referenced letter, the Trustees gave
conditional approval to doubling the nusber of etudents during the acae
Genito year of 1952-53. There are now 43 malo students living at the
chateau and 13 woren boarding outaide. In addition, 31 students have
tesn awarded scholarships at other universities. Tr. Tyson estimates
that approximately 1/} of the % students at ‘obortsau wil: leave at the
end of thio acadexic year for various reasons, and the Trustess expect
to recruit about 35 stucents to restore the musber {2 residence to ap-
proxinzately 100. In addition, if money is obtained for the necessary
temporary housing, they propose to reeruit a1 additions] 10°, making 200
in rosidence at itotertsou. hey also sugrest increasing the scholarship
appointaents at other institutions to a total of £0.

&. Any such prorran would involve a capital outlay of $260,000 on
@ 100-ded dormitory and necessary study hall or euditorius. “r. tyler
understood that the present kitenhen and other facilities will serve a

total of 200 residents.
S. ¥re Tyler
14-00000

_ $e Mee Tyler expressed concern, in which those present oonsurred,
that the University was making plans for expansion without i:ving definite
inforaation. regurding the munber of acoeptable students who would be
available in future years. Sf the several hundred applicants who were
rejected last year, there wero fex, if any, who would have been adaitted
wider any circumstances.- It was agreed that a survey should imeadiately
be nade to detersing with as much acouracy.ao possible how many otudents
oan be expected to bo available for the University in the next fow years.

It was recomended that Dr. Tyaon get in touch with Hr. Lawrence Dawson of

the Departmant of State regarding the tumber and acedeate calibor of
esespees currently coming through the Iron Curtain.

6. It wae understood that Dr. tyson wold forward to Washington
in the near future detailed estiastes covering:

@ Capital outlay required for the proposed expansion.

be The operating budget of 1952-£3 on the basia of 200
studenta.

(In this coansetion, it ebould be noted that Fr. ¢. P. Jackson has just
retumed froa a trip to visit the officials of the Ford Foundation which
he wade for the purpose of proposing that the Foundaticn take over the
FUIE. The Foundation 4e@ giving thig serlous consideration bat Mr. dackeon
was roported unvilling to estinate how successful his trip had been.)

7. Pr. Tyler urged that a decision be reached vith regard to capital
iaprovenent at Robertsau by the first of Yebruary. If delayed beyond that
date, the miversity will be at the mercy of French contractore working
on an exergency schedule to nzet the opening date for the expanded
University next Fall.

8, Rowever, befare any oonelusions can be arrived at, it would
sppear most essential to carry ext the survey of available candidates
referred to in paragraph 5. above. lurthersore, Dr. Tyson is arranging
to bring his dotatled plans to washington on 22 January, after which it
will be possitie to maka a sure detailed report as to the costs involved.
At thie scooting, the potnt raieed by Dn/P regarding the insreased dangers
of penetration by Conmmists will be discussed.

_ AS promised at our last nesting, hore is the text for a new
paragraph 3 of the Himites of the Meeting Hold in Washingtoa on
Us Deeesiber 1951. This was dictated by Cliver £. Hadwood.

*3. dackoon advised that he had a tentative date to
eall on the Ford Foundation people in 7asadena on January Sth.
Braden advised that 1t would be appropriete at thet tine to
Rake a strong pitch on the Iron Curtain refugee problem with
the idea that the government was teskling this problem tus
needed eubstantial help frea private agencies, and that if
Ford would give a sizable cun.to UCPZ, which it in turn could
fara out to IRC, it would help to get the ball rolling on a
major peyohological warfarc problen. Eraden stressed that
private initiative was extresely important that if a private
egency acted now, it would epeed ap the governmental machinery.
Ho algo said that the maxinus estimated governncntal contri-
butica teward this probloa was. not expected to be more than

half the cost.

®Braden leo advised that IRC had agreed with David
Martin for Mart{n to step dowm fron his post as Zxequtive
Dircctor and that the Committee was considering the appoint-
nant of a well-known university president to essure the job.
Be said that Martin had agreed to step ort of the pisture
altogether if the Committee wished hia te do so but that in
any case his role from now on would be nizor.

*I% was also agreed that this discussion of refugees and
TRC could include the plan worked up by Parle and Lolbeare to
turn over to IRC SCPE *non-produstive exiles at a cost to SCFB

of approxiastely 81,000 a heed.*

purpose of conducting folish prograns froa that country, Hr. Robert 8.
Lang, Director of facio Free turope, has advioed ua that on .

3 January 1952, the Zeard of Lircotas of the National Committee

Stated that ca fr. C. 5. Jackson's last trip to Portugal, the
authorities thare acvised hin that. ary Polioh oxiles brought in
under the above-noutioned cirousstances would have to live under
conditions approximating "house arrest,” since the Portugese
goverment would not tolerate their circulating freely within the

Country.

2. Later Fr. Ssencer Phenix stated that he and Mr. 6
Thomas delieved that sone few Poles could de brought in without
such drastic actio: by the Portucese authorities. Hs also oxpressed
Concern that the short wave communications between Munich and Lisboa
were not 100K aaticfactory for transmitting the Polish prograss,
which are then relayed out of Lisben to Poland. Me felt that
programzing in Portugal would be the bast way to handle the probdles
But edeitted that apprexisately 100 people would be nseded, and,

Dear Abbotts

Thank you for reminding me that Fd McHale may soon
be available. As you say, I know him, tnougn slightly,
bat I have always heard excellent things about hin.

I have made an attempt to find out who expressed
interest in him to Tom Myers but cannot do so. Perhaps,
therefore, you would pass this note on to Tom and ask him
to let no know sometime soon who expressed the interest.
That would help me ascertain whether we will want to try
to bring him down here.

My very best wishes to you for the New Year.

PROPOSED STATTMENT

cr

Tne National Committee for a Freo Furope is an organi zation of
private Anerican citizens whose purpose is to encourage the spread
of frecdom behind the Iron Curtain in Europe. It is a maabersaip
corporation, chartered under the laws of the State of New York.

In spreading the doctrine of freedom and combatting Soviet
totalitarianian, the Qmualtteo operates radio atations wileh piores
the Iron Gurtain; in close cooperation with the French authorities
and the Univorsity gf Strasbourg, it operates an educational edntre
at Strasbourg for young men and women who have escaped froa behind
the Iron Curtain; it attempts by other means than radio to carry
messages of hope and of tho poscibility of eventual liberation to
the nations wiich are now enslaved; it conducts studies of tho lays,
customs and cultures of theso nations as they existed prior to
Soviet occupations and-it docuncnts the changes which have been
Amposed by the Soviet so that if the time sould come when the
people rise against their conquerors, they may more easily ostab-
-lish contimity with their past.

In all of thie work the Comiittes draws information and support
from many sources -- from thoso who have escaped and wno must reaain
anonymous for fear of roprisals on their fanilies at home, fres those
in this country who wish to work voluntarily for the cause of freedon
abroad, from the American people at large, and from goverment agen-
cles which, in the American tradition, give all possible aid to
private citisens engaged in a worthwhile public cmse.

Fand raising for the Committee ia done by a subsidiary, the
Crusade for Freecom which, in the course of raising money, also
helps to keep before the Amorican people and people throughout the
world the noed for spreading tho idea of froedom. For example, the
Freedom Bell, which now rings regularly over the olty of Berlin, was
the gift of sixteen million Anericans who contributed to the Crusade
for Freedom. All in all, signatures and voluntary donations fron
Bore than twenty-five million Americans have coma to the Crusade for
Freedom to date. Generous contributions have alco been made to tha
Committee by private foundations; and at the request of Governaent
agencies, certain specific research and other projects have been
undertaken and carried on with the assistance of funds provided by

the departments or agencies concerned.

A Board of Directors consicting of proainent American citisens
from all walks of life pass upon the policies and supervise tho

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mrs. Braden, PY/1I0
SUBJECT: Radio Free Europe

1. For your information the following report on Radio Freo Europe

Hungarian broadcasts was received here recently, although the informa-"°~ ~~~
tion was obtaincd last Marche :

“a, Radio Free Europe broadcasts from MUNICH, Germany,
are more popular than the Voice of America programs and its
news coverare is considered both current and based on authen-
tic sources, However, its commentaries on foreign politics
are severely criticised and allegedly the general opinion in
Hungary is that whoever writes this program has not the
slightest idea either of the conditions in Hungary or of the

general needs of the people.

"b. There ane also opjections to the program of News
Briefs (ROVAT ADASOK). This propram is considered a nuisance
and isn't even listened to by those for whom it is intendeds
By scheduling 15 and 30 minute proprams specifically veamed
to different segments of the population, such as: the women's
program, the church program, the farner's program, book and
movie reviews, etc., Radio Free Europe reduces its listening
audience to those wno mirht be interested in tre specific
program, while the majority o: the listeners are forced either
to cease listening to their radios or change to another broad-
castin; station, As a result, Radio Free Europe has beon losing
its audience and the decline is especially noticeahle during
the progran of Nows Briefs when the majority of the listeners
allegedly change over to the BAC program.

"ce, The worners are particularly interested in political
news and are in an excellent position to spread the news
throughout the factories, Again ths BAC appears to be the
nost popular station. Informant learned of the fate of ono
Imre HORVATH, & proun leuwier in a Textile Mill in SZZGiD,
HORVATH passed on some news concerning the activities of the
"Political Police? of SZeGED which he had eriginally heard
on one of these foreirn broaucasts, This resulted in HOAVATH
bein imediately transferred to DUNAPENTElRand Ais "yroup”
was disbanded.

youth of Hungary is vory acute. The youth of today which
has passed tte loth yeur of age docs not listen to children's
prorcrars any: loner but js interested in broadcasts on the i ?
subject of anti-Commntist ideolozies, This ia the ao sroup 1
that tho Communists are ospocially interestud in and on whose
lucation {n the Communist apirit special emphasis is placed. :
All of thie azo froup, without oxcention, attends Comminist
Party schools and Marxist seminars and also reccives pro=
military training. To ald in this therough indoctrination
in Marxism -aa-presionted to them, special nowspipors and

: First, it ds fot that because of the natlonevide acecptinee of the Crusade

: and its recognized success curiny the pist to years it would bu a mistake

to substitute the Minus foe Prec: don glopan for Cranade for Freeda. Tho ‘

“ic have camo up with another idea which we feel would lend itself to the
mrcatest possible psycholo.ical warfare usayice It would also cnable us to
coordinate our caupaipn wit? the objectives and progran of the Voice of
Ancricaes

Tying in tho previous accon.clishments of the Crusade, namely, facilitics
for Radio Frce Europe, the Freedom Bell and the balloon aperetion, we fecl

» that ve could distribute through our ctate and local orcvanizations millions

of thin paper leaflets, cuc.. as those uscd in the ‘finds of Freedom operations
Thezo would carry a messaz based on the Christmas thee of peace on earth,
wood Will to men; the Frecdon bell vould be printed at the top, and bencath
the forcign lanquaz @ MESTAaYCE would be spaca at the bottom for pcrzonal
signatures and addresses. And the si:maturcs would be pronuoted throughout

“the country on tho basis that these nessnces of good wil] would be flvm

in balloons bohind the Iron Curtain during the Christmas ccason. The basic
approach to tho Ancrican pacple would be thit thir -contributions to thin
yoarts campaign would not only go to purchace balloons thit «sould carry
their personal mesaaze behind the Iron Curtain (we now havo stored in funich
55,000 unmarked P-20 balloons and 5,000 balloons marked ‘“lolnese"), but
somid also go to improve and increase the facilitics of Radio Free Europe

and Radio Free Asia.

The focal point of this carpaiim would be a balloon itsclf. | “ic have 20,000
FPe20 balloons in Minneapolis. These ballvong could be dlctributcd through
state chairmen to citics and toxns where they could be tnflated and placed
in front of city hall or public square. Buncath the balloons, receptacles
srould be placed where both the lesfleta and contributions could be collected.
For example, cach city cumaittce could letter its balloon to.rcad "Prom the

Citizcns of Pooria, Illinois, U.S.A."

Actually, none of these balloons zould be shipped to Europe, but the Jcaflote
could be air-mailed to New York on December 15th and be forwarded to Hunich

to arrive before Christmas Day.

Another possibility to be considcred ig the "gift" fron Amrizan people idea.
We now have in iunich 100,000 razor blades, 75,000 needles, 150,000 cakes of
sorp and 100,000 zippers. These might t& included in the balleons. I think
this idca has much to commend it. Por one thing, this would jive soncthing
besides words to the pesples behind the Iron Curtain who are likchy to ret
fed up on too many mess2%c3 which tell then to keep thcir chins up. Svcondly,
it provides an cxecllent wey of countering Red proparanda against the ballow
operation; Madio Free Zurope will then be able to a ask, "Jon't your masters
want you to reccive gifts? Don't they want you to as nk why. it is so difficult
to get razor blades in your country and why the {rec world has enouch of

then that it can send then to you?" j

I presume that the qucstion vill be raised es to what the Communists rould
do with advanee knowledge of the opcration. I fccl that the arncwer to this

so these messazes of fricndship and hope for the peoples behind the Iron Curtains
By thus taking the offensive and putting the Communists on notice that this
is a great exprvssion of wuinimity on the part of the American people —

any attempt on the part of the Communists to deprecate or interfere with

the program would lend itself to psychological warfare usc, This coincides
with General Clay's statement in his lettcr of February ljth to the various .

state chairmen.

We aré not underestimating the magnitude of such an operation here or abrecd.
7 - To pain the naxinun psychological benefit, at least 100,000 balloons choul
: “be used. It could be a hard-hitting demonstration of the effectiveness of

F the Crusade for Frocdotis

Every nenbcr of the Crusade staff, includin; the ficld organization, hopes
that this idoa may be approved. Sccing the balloons in their hore towns and
knowing that their messages could reach the peoples behind-the Tron Curtain
should inspire millions of Amcricans to supper’ the compaign financially and
vould serve to renind then constantly throughout the campaign of the tre=
mendous accomplishnents achieved during the last two ycars as a result of

a consultant's fee to investigate the Crusade operation, both from
tae standpoint of substance and administration with particular
attention to cost.

2. Tis provico was mado at the instance of Mr. Heddon, Insvector
General. I argued at this meeting that since tho Crusade itself was
a fund-raising agency and employed another fund-raising agency to help
St, the employment of a third Nnd-raising agency ay convul tant was
comparable to placing an advorticing contract with H. W. Ayer and
then placing another contract with Young % kubican to investigate
i. W. Ayer's conduct under the contract. Mr. Heddon inaisted in
response that this was reasonable business practice and his view

carried the day.

3. Several weeks aro, with all the tact that I could muster,
I conveyed to Admiral Filler, the President of CTH, my intention to
employ the firm of Harold Oram or some other funderaising, a,ency or
Andividual whom he aight care to siggest as a consultant to mo and
tee Crusade operation. Admiral Miller said he would like time to

trink about this.

4. With kindly intent but considerable firmness, Adniral iiller
told me on 3 June that after thinking it over he had decided that if
this step were taken he would resign as President of NCFE. We went
on to say that he had taken this job at our request and because he
had been told that we placed confidence in him to run an efficient
operation. He had worked hard trying to make the operation efficient;
he had particularly noted that the Crusade was not run according to

his standards of efficiency; he had made sevoral changes in tho
Crusade and was about to make moro; he had himself employed people
whom he rogarded as expert who were responsible to hin to give hin
advice on tho Crusade problem -and ho simply could not tolorate a
system of ingpection which was not responsible to him; if wo had

‘ any lack of confidence in him as an officient manager, ho would be

clad to return to nis formor employment imiedLatoly.

5. Wo discusced the whole problem in friendly terme for sano
ton minutes and it was apparent that nothing I could say would alter
his poaition. I therefore-- ceased to press hin.

6. May I have a decision as to whether higher authority wishes
to take this up with Admiral Miller or whether tho FRC wishos to
ay

strike its instructions to mo.

: MEMORANDUM FOR: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR POLICY OOORDINATION

ee SUBJECT: National Committee for a Free Europe

i 1. I am naturally disturbed by the report which has reached

: me ag to your attitude on the National Committee for a Free Europe,

i as expressed to the Inspector General at a meeting last week which
I was unable to attend because of absence from the city.

2. This attitude, as described to me, was that you knew very
little about NCFE but that you had the general impression that it
was rather loosely handled from an administrative and policy control
standpoint. I do not wish to go into the histcry of NCFE control by
CIA and be accused of casting aspersions on its nandling in the past.
I do think, however, that your allegations may te correct so far as
the past is concerned.

3. As of the present, however, I want you to know that
Mr. Durkee and I, with very able assistance from members of
Mr. Durkee's staff, are doing our level best to set up agreed upon
procedures for administrative, financial and policy control and
reporting. With the best objectivity I can muster, I think that
your responsibility over the National Committee for a Free Europe

is now being ably discharged,

kk. I would Like at your convenience to go over the new
L arrangements that have been made and to bring you completely up
to date on the activities of the Committee, as well as to get your

u\ instructions as to a system of making such periodic reports to you

in the future. This briefing mght well take the form of a prelin-

_ inary budget review and I sugsest that the division heads of NCFE
might be brought down to make progress reports to you in the briefing
room. I am hopeful that after such a meeting you will feel not only
conversant with the present arrangements and activities of the
Comittee but that they will, with modifications you may wish to

sugeost, havo your full approval, and that consequently you will
wisn to mako some statement at an early staff meeting indicating
your satisfaction with these plans. Otherwise, I very much fear
that the prevalont attitude within OPC wich is one of general
sdissatisfaction with NCPE based largely on inadequate understanding
of what the Committee is doing may prejudice the work that with your
concurrence I brought BLll Durkee here to do.

1. We approciate receiving the informtion on the two Albanian

: was forwarded in references

' 2 We have now received a re;ort from the ficld which indicates
that Koste Xhajanka is connected with the Albanian Legation in Paris.

! 3+ We would like very much to know the background of this man's

1 acceptance at the Free Europe Univereity, including how and where his

. application was madcy whether hie acceptance was on the basis of his
scholastic record alone or on the basis of recommendations; if the
latter, whose; and any other details available. It would be appreciated
if you could inquire into this matter for us. .

4. Since requesting that favorable consideration be given to
: the application of Ramis Qira, we have received a rorort which in-
dicatee that he too has becn connected with the Albanian IS. It is
requested that steps be taken to ensure that his application be dis-
approved.

5. It has also been reported that a Kalem Goleml, also covertly
employed by the Albanian Legation in Faris, has applied for admission
to the Free Europe University.

6. All of these reports anpear to indicate that an effort is
being made by the Albanian Government to place their agents in the
Free Europe University. If this is true, no doubt other satellite
countries will follow the same policy. It is sugested that the
authorities of Free Europe Univercity be warned and advised to screen
carefully the students being admitted and to refuse admission to

people about whom there is any question.

one of these days and I wish you would bulld up a little flie

Dre Allan . :
Mr. Norberg Hl
Mr. Korns :

after arrenging au sppointmont through his cousin, Senator Moody,
tr. Scripps called on the Director to discusa his proposal for a a”
Sypiendship Balloon Lift." Certain materials relating to this proposal
had previouely been transmitted to the Director by rir, Allen Dulles,

In reply to questioning, “fr. Scripos asserted that he was well
acquainted with the SCfs winds of Freedom canpatgn, in wich he had
participated, but that he had not discussed his present proposal with
NCKice ie said he had talked to many American business men, wno ware
&1l enthusiastic and were prepared to donate the variety of products
which he proposes should be included in the payloads. He said that his
father was an ardent supporter of the project, along with a Ar, Fleteher,
Vice ?ragident of the Caterpillar Tractor Company and Dr. Harnett.

Hr. Fleteher spent some time in Russia, he said, hen asked whether
Caterpillar was in the balloon businesa, ir. Scripps said noe

Uther nanes mentioned by Mr. Scripps as being familiar with nis ,
proposal included Nick Naradi, identified as an exeninister of the
Kungarian Governzent; Frank Jewitt of Ganeral lis (which holds a
balloon research contract with the Uffice of Naval ‘tesearch), who has
given hia a letter to an admiral; an Admiral <illers and a Mr. “rank
of CIA. (see bulow) r. Scripps also mentioned a ‘Psychological squipe
ment Development Office Iccstsd in the old Prost Uffice building,

(see below)

Mr. Scripps vas troubled by security probleae, It was apm rent
that he felt he had obtainod confidential information from certain governe
ment sources which he could not disclose, At tne sane time, he stated
that in crder to work out his proposal in any detail, he would need
access to information presently denied him, fherefore, ne suggested
that he be cleared tor security by tne appropriate agencye

As a result, it proved ispossible to nail down the technical
aspects of Mr. Scripos’ proposal, In his formal presentation, he had
@oscribed a balloon capable of carrying a 10-pound payloed and costing
$5. In big conversation, he sentioned a vehicle capable of carrying
300 to 800 pounds, together with a stagrored release mechanisme-without

Serippe replied that ho waa bound by confidences, In general, however,
he did not foresse any technical barriorse -

. . £

. When asked how he would finance his proposal, tire Scrippo said
that ho would begin with private contributions, with the thought that
eventually the program would be taken over by tha govegnaant. tle 1.
strega.on the need for early organisation (oege fund raising, balloon
stockpiling, crow training, selection of leunching sites) in orier
operations could be started immediately followin; s decision as to
desirability, He atated that 90 days would be eufficient to prepare °
for operetions, once he got the "green light".

De, Allen expressed his personal interest in the proposal, but -
Peminded Hr, Scripps that Poi's field was strategic rather than opera=
tional, and that in an opérational proposal of such complexity, PCB
could only give the matter s cursury review, Therefore, Lr, Allen stated
hie intention to forward the propusal to the Psycholovical vperations
Coordireting Committea, whicn wos the proper body to give the project
tho detailed screening to which it was entitled. Ur, Allen also suge
gested that Hr, Scrippa see C. D. Jacksan, .

My. Norberg then augrested that as an edditional aid ir. Scripps
prepare a brief but fairly specific description of what he personally
was prepared to do, along with an outline of tie organization which would
be nesded to carry out the project. Hr. Scripps saic that he wuld do

COMMANE

-doe Frenk, when asked about Hr. Seripos, said he had met hin several
tines between Deceuber 1950 and February, 1951. During this perianal of
early planning for baljoon operations, Franx aaid that Seripps proved
quite helpful by quieting curtain private unt:usiasts, in addition to
maintaining a discreet silence hinself, rrank aid cot know for a fact
thet Mr, Seripps participated ia the Auguat operation, but judged that
it was likely, Ia Frank's ovinion, Scripvs is a capavle person with
waluable connections in the business world and sufficient financial
independence to be aole to devote most of his tims to good works, Frank
thinks it would te a good ides to nave him cleared as a consultant.

The Paychological :quipsent Development Uffice acntioned by Ar,
feripps' is believed to be the Physical Security cratpecat agency, a
military develoosent agency oncrated by the air Force under an USD

WIe-

LEEEOUICTONY HISTORY

Fornative Sta,

At ita inception, the National Comdtvee for a Free Europe
belteved that its Iron Curtain broadcasting operation, Kadio Free
Europe, could and sheila te developed and pursued through the mediun
of "National Councils® or “Comittees of Liberation" composed of
exile groupe from the target comtries. It was considered that
prominent exile leaders ai personalities of each nationality group
could express to their captive countrymen, entirely without American
advice and guidance, tie messege of hore wnicn CFS proposed to send.
This concept waa not fu:filled, kxperience in attexpting to weld a-
talented, dedicated group of exiles into a non-partisas broadcasting
operation early dexonstrate< that without Azerican control the mission
of KFE would be lost is t:e fungle of extle-world politics, It soon
becaze evident that the leacership among the exiles was neither suffie
elently strong nor persczally willing to rise above tiie political cross
currents, factional rivalries, and splinter-group weaknesses character~
istically reminiscent of the political affairs of all Lastern -uropean

countries, These factors nilitated against tne original plan of pernitting
14-00000

exiles, through their loosely oryanized Councils or Committees, to
wholly develop, manage, and contrcl RFE broadcasting. .

Since the advent of RFb was tne most important developzent
affecting the exiles wiich iad occurred since their flirht fro: home,
they quickly understood and applauded its implications and potential
effect on their futures, Tnrourh this instrument they could once
again become prominent and powerful in the affairs of the horelands
once sore they could contend for place and power,

Sslection of personnel for the purpose at hand quickly vecane
&@ political football of rival leaders, personalities, and groups.
Rishtists, Leftists, Centrists, Labor Blements, and Splinter-groups
argued with us for advancement of their particular personal or political
views, Sponsorship of their own adherents as RFE exployees through whoa
such views would be broadcast to their captive countrymen beeane the
pattern of thei: pseudo cooperation, This pattern was followed ‘to such
an extent that ordinary progress and sensible development of our basic
parzose of truly free broadcasts under exile control soon appeared to
be not only impracticable, but dangerous. For exacple, the National
Councils Division atleupted to inaugurate broadcasts to Czechoslovakia
wader the auspices of a Gzechostovak National Council. The Gounet2 was
gud is sade up of exile personalities of differiny political views and
parties. Its factions proceeded to engage in endless disputes and ire
reconcilatle claims for control of seript production and propran ‘content.

sought that objective, wnile Czecha desired opposite views to be aired
—" and advocated the rebirth of pre-war Czeshoslovakia. bach group eponaored
and insisted upon employment of its own more or less qualified adherents
upon the assucption that its special views would te thereby expressed ©
to the captive Czecioslovak audience of RFk, Similar activities were
pursued by Hungarians, Fulgarians, and Poles until the futility of per-
mitting the exile Councils to control the destiny and broadcasting
—_ policies of RFE was made clear beyond refutation, It becane tragically
obvious that uncontrolled exile-world Councils and professional poll~
ticians could not agree on personzel selection or program content.

‘In spite of every effort to induce harmony in and obtain proper
cooperation from the "Councils", "Comaittees", and individuals, RFL was
confronted with an inpasse. The alternative ti.eory and present policy
of American selection of non-political exile personnel was the only way
out. It has worked. Technically qualified personrel produce properly
oriented prorracs «- and have beer, doing so with docuzented success
since July, 1950. Disappointed exile politicians, professional exile
camp followers, disturbed American special pleaders, and alarned Coxmnist

Agents all screaz, snipe and snivel -- but Rr programs are doing the job.

NCFE-RFB records of this stare can be supplied by Frederic KH,

Dolbeare, Vice-President, National Councils Division, and Robert E. Lang,

Director, RFE, The current policy has the couplete endorsement of these

‘ officers and of the Board of Directors of NCFE.

B, Development Stage

Upon the collapse of the oriyinal concept of broadcasting under
; exile auspices, RFE necessarily utilized some exile »ersonnel endorsed
' and recormended by the leaders of the varlous nationality ;roups. As
\ technical radio facllities cane Into Leing, exiies with radio background
: or writing talent were required for the production of programs, Thia
\ involved using individuals euinently qualified ty experience to do a
radio job of script writing, announcing, acting, etc. without regard
for the fact that such individuals wight be at odds with one or another
political faction or leader of an exile "Council". It also involved
elimination of proven inefficient, inept or unworthy individuals without ,
regard for their exile "Council" sponsorship. In either instance crite

fdeism of RFE was predictable and indeed was always forthcoming <= often

in virulent and dishonest fors.

The day to dey operation of KFE developed new techniques and

long range plana wiieh made it i:.possible to e:ploy non-entities of no
. Political color or conviction. The best people to produce programs in

harmony with NCFL-RFE purposes and policies necessarily were persons
known in their own countries for their views on domestic political af-
fairs and their antiCommist activities. Hard-hitting propayanda
required hard-hitting personalities whose known association with RFE
and its prograzs would add validity and sigaifieance for our captive - . “y
audiences, Gradually, therefore, the nationality desks of RFL at New :

vat

York and Municn were staffed with testeu, qualified exiles wo iad been

ddontified publicly with doneotic political philosophies at issuce in
their own countries. Many, in fact most of the ataff people ure con-
troversial fieures axonp tiolr own countrymen in exactly the sane way
that prominent Americans are controversial in our political arena, Many
dadeed aro members of the Counolls, but are wen of sufficient stature
to ive thetr primary aliegiance to the non-partisan policy of RFE, The

decisive factor ia that there be no controversy or question about their

anti-Commniat convictions and records,

At this point, it imet be noted that our target countries have

been subject to repetitive political ferment prior to and following . .

World war II, as well as the successive occupations of Naai and Communist
Arnios,

The temper of the tines, therefore, in which these exiles have
lived for the past fifteen years nas been one of excitexent, bitterness,
.Tecrimination, rivalries, and personal turaoil =~ all steraing fro. both
domestic and foreign strug: les for power. The times have prodyged a
bunper crop of refugee traitors, collaborators, and opportunists and at
the sane time have developed pure Western style democrats, true national :
patriots, and unselfish honest wen, The extle who stood by placidly -
through the era is not «uch raod, however talented, as a nilitant messen- : , t
"ger of nope via RFL; exiles wno were honoratly active in public affairs a

‘at hore and who had radio talent were, therefore, the only kind of

personne) suitable for RF: purposes.

As the necessity for Averican operational control of rationality

desks teca-e self-evident, the only feasible personnel policy was to

-5-

14-00000

employ properly qualified individuals, regardless of exile politics.
In the execution of tuis policy individuals w o were useless were
e@liminated without regard {or political sponsors. This process still
goev on. Sintlarly, talented exile personnlities recruited fro. any
source were employed wherever needed. This process etill foes on,

Both processes are in vorue with a healthy disregard tor exile political
nuances-and protests, Neither proccss is satisfactory to self. styled .
exile ‘Yeadors, since it follows that the eppotntment of an individual
gponsored by one faction aa a representative of its views inevitably
will evoke howls of rage and oriticia: fro:. the opposite faction, This

io an accepted fact of exile life, tie save to live with it and get on

with the job.

The dest source of exile personnel is referral by "non-

professional" exiles the.selves, Anong ell nationalities there are

ob
14-0000

many talented refugees who need employwent and ko can supply RFR
need for script writers, actcrs, announcers, etc, Accordingly, desk
staffing has been accomplished by exanining the qualifications of duly
recomended individuals, whether the recormendationa come frou political
personalities or otherwise, Seleotion is based on tho ability of the
indi vidual to fill a need efficiently in turning out or participating
dn planned: progra:s,. Reeruitzent is deternined unly by ideolorical
security, independence of exile politics, and personal ability, - This

4a not to say that many individual exiles having decided personal con=
victions and well-known political records ure not employed, but a : .
positive statement is made that those exile employees now produce

RFk progra:s refleot the policies and guidance of RFE rather than pro=

motion of partiuan objectives and personalities,

Recruitzent -- Detailed Procedures

The personnel corplenent of each RFE nationality desk is
founded on a hard core of dependable individuals, usually two or three
people, including the chief of tha desk. “Dependability” is established
hy exhaustive inquiry at all available sources to establish tie desire
ability, reliability, technical proficiency and security of the working

core of the desk. Sources used are?

(a) Exile political personalities in the United States,
(b) Exile references of hign standing and known ine
partiality in tre United States and Overseas,
(¢) Overseas contacts and personal knowledge of our
American representative in Lurope (Royall Tyler-Paris),
(d) Checks and balances of our political advisor at
Munich (WS. Griffith),

c,

(e) . British Hrondcastiny Corporation, where applicable,
(£) Voice of Anericn, where applicable,
(g) Special confidetiai sources,

These teats haviny been applied, confidence ia plaq jin these
initial personalities, and particularly in the Desk Chicf, to carry
forward recruitment of additional personnel ao needed in collaboration
with the American Director of HPL (Robert E, Lang, New York) and his
aseociate officials, The leadiny personalities of each desk know what
is expected of them and.aince they respond to the established criteria,
the resulting full personnel coxplenent 1s a group of exiles who, not-

withstanding their personal political views, are suitable and capable

‘ program production poople. They geet our basic requirement of daily

production of truly free and. properly constructed propaganda broadcasts

capable of evoking the widest possible audience response in our tar; et
countries, .

In brief, the mission of RFE be:ng conceived as a marketing
problem, the best available saleszen are procured, trained, and utilized

to sell the warket.

Recruitment -- Special Security Measures

Since RFE, although a private enterprise, is by extension a
collateral instrument of American national policy, special precaution
is exercised to insure the ideoloyical security of all employees, ine

RFE POLICY (UIDMICE FOR PLiSONNEL

The propramo aired by AFE are not left to whim or chance, All

programs and tho ‘personnel responsible for then are controlled by ao
written policy nanual., The manual sets forth in minute detail the
position and policy of ik on every topic beased t.. our target countries,
The marual is the daily puidance of a1] employees, both American and
Exile; deviation from its rules is not parinitted. Continuous scrutiny
of manuscripts and rosultant broadcasts te naintalned by Anerican en~

Ployees to insure that there are no deviations,

The policy manual of RFE represents the considered views of
the responsible officials, including the Board ef ULrectors, of NCFE,
It 4s a statement of the principles and purposes of KUFE expressed in
operational form, It 1s considered and naintained as strictly cor-

fidential document, but 1t is of course available for examination by any

proper authority,

The politcy manual is in strict conformity with current American

national policies as evidenced by tne following quotation fro. Article

Ones

“As a non-rovernnental radio station respoisible to
the millions of American citizens who suppory it,
RFE cannot take a line contrary to Unitea States
Government policy or to tne beliefe of tne Averican
peoplo reflected in the Constitutio:: of tie United
States and in American Institutions.".

The above quotation is understocd by exile personnel par- .
ticularly to be a solemn injunction apainst ideolo; ical prograa content
wnich in any way violates the letter and spirit of American policy and
ideals, It isa guarantee to the-American people and to our captive
listeners ‘that RFE and the cen who sake ity programs are uncompromisingly

opposed to the Communiat regines now in power in Soviet Russia and the

satellite countries, . co oa

B. RFE Policy Defined by Handbook (Direct Quotations)

1. The purpose of RFL is to contribute to the liberation of
the Nations imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain by sustainin; their .
morale and stimulating in then a spirit of non-cooperation with the
Soviet-dominated regines by which they are, for the tixe being, ruled.

2. The central characteristic of RFE is that it is the ine -
struzent d men who are engaped in fighting for freedom and justice,
As such, it encourages resistance to every tyrant, great and small, in
the countries it addresses, Its speakers speak == as men of good will
whe seek to contribute to the elinination of old enmities and the
; building of an enduriny European decocratic order,

3. Asa free forum in w.ich exiles speak to tueir own poeple i.

RFE is particularly dedicated to argumenta by wi.ich exiles seex to

persuade their listeners of all devourin, arbitions of Soviet

Inperialisn, the cruelty and unworkability of Communist institutions,

-he-
14-00000

and the proven advantages of the democratic way of life for the worker,

and the peasant, the administrator, and the business and professional

strata of society,
4. RF, takes counsel with exile leaders and is respectful

of their views, but its policy is not designed to further the aspira-~

tions of 8.y single exile leader or party.

5. RFE policy is further based upon acceptance of tre prin-
ciple that each of the liberated peoples shall be free to deternine
for itself the political and social] institutions under which it will -

live once it has been liberated,
6. Finally, the followinr summary in the nature of a apecific

limitation on progran content is quoted:

"It is indispensable that all concerned grasp clearly
that RFE is a multi-national station established to
contribute to tle liberation of all the peoples it

Dear Spenoort

Here io a brief of the material that is wanted in
reapect to the alave labor issua. .

Tis is of great importance, as you can well imagino,
bat for your information wo find ourselves in something of
a dox on this because having pressed for the hearings, it
is essential to gather good evidence and not be embarrassed
by something we have fought to obtain.

I hope, therefore, that you will give 1t your top con-
sideration and let me know'if you can some up with anything.
In addition to the kinds of evidence listed hore, you will
note that private organisations may testify.

Sinoerely,

Dear Oliver:

Whicn I last saw you, I spoke of tho General

Hennyey matter explaininy the creat importance that
the Fund places on expediting Une arrival of Senoral
Hennyoy in this country for Fund purposes. I Later :
mentioned this matter in detail to one of your Liaison a
associates who has these matters in hand. I explained —
that it is considercd imperative that all possibte as-
sistance be developed looking toward the sponsored ar-
; vival of General Hennyey in the shortest possible time. 4
i - I now refer you to our letter of March 2, 1952, which I

delivered in person to Mre Abramson. That letter con-
tains all of the necessary data for action in the case.

i

We have just been informed that the unconscionable
delay in the processing and approval of General Hennyey's ‘
entry presently will be made the subject of public pro- .
test by elements of the Hungarian National Council. i
The details of this situation will be more fully explain-
ed by Leonard L. Stamm who will hand you this Letter.

For your convenience, I am attacning a copy of our

i letter of March 2 above cited, and I would further state
i that wa believe that extraordinary action should be

: taken to affect the immediate processing of General

: Nennyey by entry permit or otherwise. Our representa-
tives in Munich are in daily contact with General
Hennyey and can be of particular assistance in the event
you desire to use extraordinary means to expedite his
departure for the United States.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Minett: . , : 2 \

- General Gusstav Hennyey is Representative of the Hungarian National
Council in Western Germany and a persen in whom ‘the Fund places trust and
confidence in ity dealings with the problems of the Tiunzartan National
Council. The Fund has beon desirors for sony time that General Hennycy
come te the United States, and believes that his visit hore would be most
helpfid to the present activities and future of the Hungarian National

Council. :

An opportunity presented itself last fall for General Hennyey to
emigrate to the United States as a displaced person. He was granted a : q
visa by the Consul General in Munich on November 21, 1951, EC Number 254411,
D.P. Commission Validation Number A-/037, Sponsor Mr. Louis Rado, 152 Main
Street, Poughkeepsie, New York. Subsequent to the issuance of his visa :
his file was sent by the local representative of the U. S. Immigration t
and Naturalization Services in Munich to the Office of the Attorney Gen- :
eral in Washington for special consideration under No. 3-CFR'17557. '
Noither General Hennyey nor the National Council have been able to deter-
mine why his case has been held in suspense, by the Immigration and Natur-
Indeed, in response to ono inquiry Genaral Hennyey

As stated above, the
Fund attaches great importance to General Hennyoy's visit to the United
States, and considers this visit to be of high operational importance,
since it will deeply affect the work of the Hunyarian National Council.
We shail be very grateful for any assistance which you can render in tha

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIOFNCE | -
SUBJECTS Crusade for Freedon

1. At a meeting in John Devine's office at noon on 16 April
at which were precent Hassrs. Davins, Qnith, Lang, Lanble, Braden
and Admiral Hiller, Mr. Suith presented the programa for the Crusade
for Freedom for naxt year, which I attach. ‘he budget ostimate ta
just over $500,000 and the central idea ia to campaign acrves the
nation for signatures and dimes on behalf of a pledge to preserve,
meintain and spread freedom.

2. There are other ideas connacted with thia, namely a froedon
train which will carry the scroll and dimes of the people of the .
United States from point to point and which eventually will come to
Washington where the signatures attached to the scroll will be
Pavounied ‘to the naw Congress and tho naw Fresident. Eesenttally,
however, and-in terms of our relations with the State Departaent,
the progran is intended to avoid specific mantion of what the money
ie being raised for; thus, for example, there will be no publicity
about what tranositters cost and how isportant it is to raiso the
money. Inatead, the campaign will be kept very genoral and RFE~RFA
and YOA will be mentioned only incidentally as ons means of spreading
the idea of freoton.

3. Mre Devine presented the progran to Messrs. Sargeant, Kohler
and Compton and reectved their approval. I have therefore notified

Acriral Miller that there is no objection on behalf of the State
Departaent to the plan presented for the 1953 Crussde for Freeden,

MQMORANDUM TOR: DEPUTY DIRECTION CLNTIAL INTELLIGENCE
SUBIICT: © Leon Dennen

1. Me provised for Leon Dennen $71,000 for tha period 1 August
1051 to 30 June 1952 for a project to be opsrated by FCF: ‘in Europe.
(Dennen did not, as I understand it, agswwe his work in jurope until
6. 1 Uetober 1951.) The $72,000 included an allotment of $6,000 for
ten ronthly payments of $600.00 for special intelligence activities.
Otis recently informed us, however, that of the 600,00 por month
allotments, Dennen had asked for and received a total of only 8250.00

sll told. ©

2. On 2 April, Admiral Miller stated that Dennen's work was
absolutely worthless as far ae KCFE and KL were concerned.

Dennen's intelligence reporte heve been evaluated as having
practically no usefulness; and, as you knov, in his intelligence
"gathering", ho has crossed sore of Kx's vires. In both 070 and
0S), there is such suspicion of Dennen, that no one has been willing
to give him direct guidance for foar that it vould merely onlargo

Dannan's knovledge of our operaticns,

3. When Dennen returns, ny recommendation is that ve tell him
that walle wo may discontinue support to the International Confederation
of Free Trade Untoniste in Exile, ve feel that, since we have a Paris
NCPE representative, we should uee this channele-or somo other. channel

not involving additional expense,

4. Meanwhile, sings the ICFTU in exile 1s of prinary interest
to ES, and of some intercet to SE ani bE, 1 have asked Mr. Brose, Mr.
Horton, and Hr, Scott their views on contimed support to the organization
and, efter a go-round with them, I will send up a further report to you.

‘poattion tovard the jawoent iisunity in the humanian eaigration,

- Ayril 2, 1952

Mr, Vioolanm called at his rocucet to inforr us of the high
lights of his recent trip to burope. Ho hai firet attended the
meoting of the Eastern European Section of the Burerean Movement
in London, then vielted France, O::many and Italy, ©

. Mr, Virolam said that in Germany he had taleed with Chancellor
Adenauer, Secretary of Ctate Uallatein, and other officiala of the
Bonn Government, as well as with Mr. Rober and other Allied officials.
He said that the Germans were rynpathetic to hia discussion of
lumanian affaire and showed some intercat in the problems of Eastern
Europe. They, exphasized, hovever, thet Gormany's Fevsent position
did not enable them to apeak in terme of any positive policy at this
tine, Mr, Visolenmu got the impruvsion that the Ge-mans vere now, and
would be in the future, even more actively interested in Rumania .
apd other Eastern burcpcan countries than were France ani Italy.

Mr, Visoianu felt that FP. ance had completely abdicated ite position
in Eastern Buroje and was entirely wrapped uj: in its ow domestio :
problems end relations with Germany.

Me, Visotam also discussed in Gurmany the cuestion of Rumanian
refugees there (most of thom are Iron Guardiste) ami of the rather
large comunity of Volksdeutsche who cane to Germany from Rumania at
the close of the war. lie said that the Gorman authorities vould
like to have this group returned to Rumania at such tine as the
country ‘might be litcrated, both because they contrituted to Germany's
over=popuiation protlem and because they would represent, as they
have in the past, a poseiblo instrument for German policy in humania.
Aa e Rumanian, Mr. Vicolanu was not over anxious to adi to the mmbere
of the German minarity but folt that a free Rumanian Government vould
not deny the right of return to those who wlehed to do so.

Mr. Visoiarm talked at length vith Mr, Tyler in Saris. Ho :
Fetaines his iistrust and dislixe of the "CFE, which ke says can never ‘
assist effectively in tringing about unity in the Rumanian emigration .
since it supports one group 100% and sersecutes the other group 100s, .
He vas particularly incensed about Mr. Berle's recent intervention in
the Malaxa case, He seid that he reserded tho eituation as having very '
serious iz: ications mot only for the emigree tut cleo for the future ,
of the country iteelf, He denounced ladescu's contust, giving
numerous examples, as detrimental to the true intercet of Rumania, Ono

of Comarniciu eas head tuter (or somo such title) at tho Free surope

be fhe Landowskt assignment was not, in fact, compatible with

ad. The Maison detween CIA/opo and RFE was not, during the period
under consideration, fully satisfactory in this tnatance. Quite udinor

use him as a contract agent under cover tn Greece, engnged principally tu
PY work and in recruiting and handling other agents. fhe olearance was
granted on 30 Hay 1951, and on 15 June Landowaky signed a contract in Athens.
2. The field dispatch oatlining Landowsky'e capadtlities and the work
envisaged for him described him as a froe-lanco Journalist, resident of
Greece for savoral years (his mother was mrricd to a Greok), fantifar with
the Greek language aad fluent in Polish and German, and having certain oon
tacts in Greek government ciroles. His success in interviewing refugecs
from tho satellite coumtries had come to the etation's notice, and it was
believed that under cover of such interviews he vould do useful in gathoring

3. The told station snggented that a cover organisation be estabe .

that a Nr. Phenix of HVE agreed to the contractual relationship propoeal,
but wished 1¢ mado clear that RYZ would not give cover to Landovski in the
gaico of & regular RYE employee. This wae understood and agreed to by this
offices.

&, Durtng Landowskt 's covert training in Vashington, ia July and

tion with the Legal Division, that a peresnal contract botweon Landovaki,
supposedly representing the “Burops Hews Service,” and RYE would be sufficient
and would obviate the riaks of building a cover firm out of nothing.

Nr, Lang wae particularly intorosted in waethor Landowaki could actually

Lang otated that there was no accurity risk from RYE'a internal accounting
er contracting procedure. He then mentioned that RFE planned te send one
of their own caployces to Athens lator, probably “around the end of the
year.” Although surprised, since this plan had not beon mentioned to Are
Thompson by Hr. Pheniz during the original diecusston of landowskt in July,
the onso officor 616 not go further into this, feoling that Inndowski would
have three ronths to eotablish hie cover in Athens prior to the arrival of

6. In eccoréance with arrangements made vith Mr. Leng, Landewaki

found that Ranpft was already there, vontrary to the above understanding.
Landoweki consequently found hinself obliged to justify his position, and
particularly his requests for access to refugees, as Hamft had already
progonted hia orcdentials to the Greek authorities, the American Embassy,
the Amorioon pilitary authorities, and tae intornatioaal preas representa-

officer assigned to this matter, thia division thereupon requested ir.

covert ectivities, whether Aaspft would conduct hia own work in « manner

acceptable to the CIA Senior Representative in Athens, Mr. John Boker, and

fied derogatory information had beon racoived rearding Landowski; the

field station was consequently instructed to hold w his use pending fuller

information, Karly in January, upon receiving an adverse completed report

from Seourity, tio field was instructed to retura Landowsk{ to Wachington

for termination. It was considered unwise to infore Inndownki, while still ,
in Greece, of the reason underlying hio recall; be has consequently been

told that the @nal BYE representation in Athens (Raspft and Landovek!) vas ;

4 Our best target from the point of view of geography and RFE radia coveragd

is Czechoslovakia. We can go into Poland and Hungary somewhat les efficiently:
If Hungary should be the target, we will precumatily still havo the problem of Msg
clearance from the British to launch from their Zone, and fatling that should" -

have to back up to our Zone. we

: : we

We need an abéolute minimum of three ronths to prepare a balloon operation; vw va .
the longer notice the better. A date of epecial significance to the target ;. {rv
country 1s perhaps of some slight additional desirability from the psycho- y™ wt
logical point of view. It is, however, not essential. From the point of ia
view of our campaign schedule, an initial launching date of about August J “YS

20th would be ideal. This would allow tre story on the operation and its Je

effect to become known at the opening of our September caupaign. Yefonk

: We have in storage in Munich 50,000 packazes (of two each) of razor blades, Kn -

. 100,000 zippers, 72,000 packets of needles (five to the packet), and 150,000 iG x

. cakes of soap (1/2, 3/h and one ounce gizes). All of the above except a
needles were donations to the Crusade, and the needles were at cost. Ws A
have had to tell Gillette and Talan twice (at Christmas and at Faster) that See

the operation for which they supplied their products had been delayed. We C. Ae

should very much regret having to do thiz again. Go

I do not know what keeps putting this off the track. It is ny information ow}
that the boys in the big house were initially enthusiastic about the idea, +” 7
we,

i and the record will show that Ambassador Priggs thought it most valuable ea

i in Czechoslovakia, witness his special request that this means of comuuni- \ +

: cation be used at the time of the Czech Preedom Train break-out. vbr
vAcy

I would appreciate your getting us as soon as possible a positive and (barring;
an act of God) irrevocable approval for a talluon operation into a specifiedy~, -
target country at a certain date, with agreement in principal on the nature
of the operation =- f1.e., of an order of magnitude of 60,000 to 75,000
vehicles, bearing the above mentioned materials together with messages. ~~
To repeat, by far the best target is Czectoslovakia; our preferred dates °:

3 : around August 20th.

Let us not make this approval in principle (with fine date and target)
contingent on a budget, except in a general way. With an approval in hand,
we can proceed with plans and supply a fairly accurate budget, which will
depend somewhat on such things as whether we can use the P-20 balloons on
hand for the short flight to Prague or wnetser we will have to resort to
P-50's for the longer flight into Poland or from the U.S. Zone of Austria

into Hungary. .

. Dear Admiral Miller:

This is tn respect-.te the various Labor 3ervica Compantos
made up of Eastern Suropean exiles now existing in Germany.

There have been Polish Labor and Guard Vompanion ever
since the war and these are what their nane implies. There
have been set up, however, within the last year Czechoslovak
and Bulgarian Labor Service Companies here. ‘These latter two
represent an activity with which our friends are directly in=
volved, I have been informed by them upon my inquiry that
should any reference be made by satellite proparanda to
these companies it is desired that in any RF comment upon
4t that these companies should be treated as being what
their name implies.

The Czechoslovak Company included both Czecha and Slovaks,
although I. understand that the Slovak Separatists here make
violent efforts to have a separate one for thenselves, The
Bulgarian Gompany is at present made up almost entirely of

adherents of Dimitrov. Further recruitinz, however, in this
respect is now soing on with a policy of barring both Bulgartan

National Front and Dimitrov followers,
I an also informed by my friends here that active plan
ning is now under way in respect to the Kersten Amendment,
J should much appreciate it if we could keep informed of any
developnents in this respect here for possible use in RFE
broadcasts and for conversations with friends,

INTRODUCTORY HISTORY

A.

Formative Stage

At its inception, the National Committee for a Frea Europe
belfeved thst its Iron Curtain broadessting operation, Rudlo Free
Evropa, could and shoul be developed and pursued through the mediun
of "National Councils" or "Comnitteos of Liberation” composed of
exile grours trea the targot oountrles, It wus considered that
Prominent exile leaders and porsonalities of each nstionality group

could express to their captive countrymen, entirely without American

talented, dedicated group of exiles into & non-partisan broadcasting
operation early demonstrated that without Anorican control tne mission
of RFE would be lost in the jungle of exile-world politios. It scon
became evidunt thet the leadership among the exlles wie neither suffi-
¢hently streag nor personally willing to rise above the political cross
currents, factional rivalries, ant e;linteregroup weaxnesses characters

isticarly reainiseent of the political affairs of all stern Buropean

exiles, through their leossly organized Couceils or Committees, to

wholly develop, manage, asd control RFZ broadcantings

Since tho advert of KFE was the mect important development
artecting the oxiios whieh hed occurred since their flight from hone,
they quickly undorstood ond applauded its implications and potential
effect on their futures. Tirough this tustrument they sould once
again become prominent and powerful in the effairs of the homolands -

once more they could contend for place erd power,

Selection of personnel for the purpose at hand quickly became
a political football of rival leaders, perzonelities, and groups.

Rightists, Leftists, Centriste, Labor Zlezents, and Splinter-groups

argued with us for advancezent of their particular personal or political
views, Sponsorsh{p of their own adherents 4s RFE employees through whom
such views would be broadcaxt to their captive countrymen became the
pattern of their pseudo covperation. This pattern was followed to such
an extent thet ordinary progress and sentizle development of our basic
purpose of truly free broadcaste under exile control soon appeared to

be not only impracticeble, but dangerous. For example, tho Mational
Councils Division attempted to inaugurate troadcests to Crechoslovakia
under the auspioes of a Crecheslovak Netiorsl Council. The Council was
and is mado up of oxile persorslities of differing political views and
parties. Its factions preceeded to engage in endless disputes and ire

recencilatle olaims for ecntrol of seript preduction and program centent.

sought that objective, while Crechs desired opposite viows to be aired
and educated the rebirth of pre=war Czechoslovakia. Each group sponsored
and insisted upon employment of its own more or less qualified adherents

upon tre sseumption that its special views would be thereby expressed
r
te the captive Czechoslovak audience of RFE.

Similar activities wore
pursued iy Hungarians, Bulgarians, ond Poles until the futility of per-
mitting the exilo Counaila to control the destiny and broadcasting
yolictes of RFE was made clear beyond refutation, It became tragically
edvious thet uncontrolled exileewerld Couneiis and profvssional poli-

Sicians could not agree on personnel selection or program content.

In spite of every effort to induce harmony in and obtain proper

eocperation from the *Counoils*, "Comuittoes", and individuals, RFE was

eonfreated with an impasse. Tho ulternative theory and present polioy
af Averican sclection of non-political exile personnel was the only way ..

out. It bas worked. Technically qualified personne! produce properly

oriented programs =- and have becn doing so with documentod success
aince July, 1950. Disappointed exile politicians, professional exile
casp folleners, disturbed Arerican special pleaders, and alarmed Gommuniat

agents all scream, snipa and snivel -- but RFE programs are doing the job.

NCFE-RFE records of this stage can be supplied by Frederic R,
Dolbeare, Vico-President, Natiora) Councils Division, and Robert E. Lang,

Director, EFE. The current policy has the complete endorsement of these

officers and of the Board of Directors of NCFE.

Devolopment Stage

Upon the Collapse of the original concept of broadcasting undor
exile auspices, RFZ nocersurily utilized sumo exile personne! endorsed

and recommended by the lasders of the various nationality groups. As

technical radio facilities came inte being, exiles with radio background
or writing talent were required for the production of programs. This .

involved using individuals eminently qualified by oxporience to do 4

radio job of soript writing, announcing, acting, etc., without regard

for the fact that such individuals might be pyrsona non grata with one

or another political faction or lender of an exile “Council”. It also

involved elimination of proven ineffictent, inept or unworthy individuals
without regard for their ezile "Council" sponsorship. in either instance

criticism of RFE was predicteble and indesd was alwaya forthcoming -=

often in viruleat and dishenest form.

The day to dey operetion of BFZ developed new techniques ang
long range plans which made it impossible to euploy non-entities of no

politicos! color or conviction, The bent people to produce programs in

harmony with NCPE-RPE purposes and policies neoessarily were persons
know in their own countrice for their views on domestio political af-
fairs and their antieComnunist ackivitios. Uardehitting propaganda
required hardehitting personalities wioss know: association with RPZ
and ita programs would add validity and significance for our captive
eudiences, Gradually, therefore, the nationality desks of RFE at Kew

York and Munich wero staffed with tested, qualified oxiles who had been

identified publicly with domostic political philosophios at {osue in
their own countrios. Many, in fuct, moat of the staff paople are con-
troversial Cigures among their own countrymon in oxactly the samo way
that prominent Americans ars controvoraial in our political arena. Many

to give their primary allegiance to the non-partisan policy of RFE. The

“dociaive factor is that tinrs be no controversy ur yuostion about their

anti-Comiunist convictions and records.

were as 4

At this point, 1¢ must be noted that our target countries have
bean subject to repetitive political ferment prior to and following

World War II, as woll as the sucessaive occupations of Nazi and Communist
Araies.

: The tompor of the times, therefore, in which these exiles have
: lived for the past fifteen years has been one of excitement, bitterness,

recrimination, rivalries, and personal turmoil << all stemming from both
domestic and foroign struggles for power. The times have produced a
bumper crop of refugeo traitors, collaborators, and opportunists and at
the same time have developed purse Aestera style democrats, true national
patriots, and unselfis:: honest men. Tho exilo who stood by placidly
through the era is not much good, howevor talented, as a militant messen-

gor of hope via RFE; exiles who were honorably active in public affairs

at home, and who had radio talont were, therefore, the only kind of

personnel suitable for RFS purposes.

As the necessity for Amarican operational control of nationality

desks became self-evident, the only feasible personnel policy was to

e

employ properly qualified individuals, regurdlesa of exile politics.

In the exvcution of this pollcy individuals wo were useless were
eliminated without regard for political sponsors. This process still
goes one Similarly, talentnad exile personalities recruited fron any
sourca wore employed whorever noodad, This process still goes one

Both processes are in vogua with a healthy disregard for exile political
nuances and protesta. Nolthor process is satisfactory to self-styled
exile leaders since it follows that the appointment of an individual
sponsored by one faction as a ropresentative of its views, inevitably
will ovoke howls of rage and criticism from the opposite faction. This

is an accepted fact of exile life. We have to live with it and gat on

with the job.

Summary

Our formative and development experiences evolved the presant
and continuing exile personnel policies of RFZ. Exile desk employees,
whether at New York or Munich, must respond to three taste;

(a) Security clearance,

(b) Endorsement of technical profictency,
(c) Sufficient stature to eliminate exile partisan

interests from programa content.

-IL-

CRITERIA AND METHODS OF PERSONNE, S2LECTION

Recruitment -- General Principles

The best source of exile personne! is referral by “non=

professional” exiles themselves, Acong all nationalities there are
14-00000

many talented refugees who need employment and who can supply RFS's
neei for script writers, actors, announcers, etc. Accordingly, desk
stalfing has been accomplished by examining the qualifications of duly
reguzmended individuals, whether the recomzendations come from political
personalities or otherwise. Selection is based on tho ability of the
individual to fill a need offictontly in turning out or participating
in planned programs. Recruitment is determined only by ideological
security, independence of exile politics, and personal ability. This
is not to say that many individual exiles naving decided personal con=
vietions and wall-knowm political records are not employed, but a
positive statement is made that those exile employees who now produse

RFE programs reflect the policies and guidance of RFE rather than proe

motion of partisan objectives and personalities.

B. Recruitment -- Detailed Procedures

fhe personnel complement of each RFE nationality desk is
i founded on a hard core of dependable individuals, usually two or three
people, including the chief of the desk. "Dependability" is established
by exhaustive inguiry at all available sources to establish the desir-
ability, reliability, technical proficiency and security of the working
core of the desk, Sources used are;
a (a) Exile political personalities in the United States,
1 : (>) Exile references of nigh standing and know im-
. partiality in the United States and Qverseas,
ty {c) Overseas contacts and personal knowledge of our
i Amerioan representative in Europe. (Royall Tyler-Paris),

to (d) Checks and balances of our political advisor at
Munich (W. E. Griffith),
14-0000 . ———

" ~

(e) British Broadcasting Corporation, where applicable,
(£) Voice of America, where applicable,
~ {g) Special confidential sources. ,

Theso tests having been applied, confidenoe is placed in these
faltial personalities, and particularly in the Deak Chief, to catry
forward rvcruitment of additional personnel as needed in collaboration '
with the American Director of RFE {Robort BE. Lang, New York ), and his :
eesociate officials. Tho leading porsontlitios of each desk know what

. 1a expected of them and since they respond to the ‘established oriteria,
the resulting full personnel complement is a group of exiles who, not-
with standing their porsonal political views, are suitable and capadle 1
prograg production people. They meet our basic requirement of daily

production of truly freo and properly constructed propaganda broadcasts

ezpable of avaking tha widest possible audience response in our target

countries.
In brief, the mission of RFE being conceived as a marketing
problen, the best available salesmen are procured, trained, and utilised

to sell tno market.

€. keeruitment -- Special Security Meusures A

Since RFc, although a private enterprise, is by extension a
eollateral instrument of American national policy, special precaution
is exercised to insure the ideological security of all employees, in=

eluding exiles. In the case of exile personnel specifically, the

leognne ee Tiree nr eR oda net ele re oe RENAN AST ERR a A I MEY AS a EN Rh wc

additional approval of tho Personnel Director of NCFE is required before
employment, either at New Yorx or Munich. Thus, even if a proposéd

exile employes mevts all the described oriteria ho may not be employed

without this ultimate approval. c

The Personnel Dirostor of NCFe ubliizes appropriate and de=

pondablo sources of information to determine the accoptabllity of

personnel from a seourity standpoint. His sources are investisative in

nature and are conclusive as to the ideological record and security

: _ acceptability of tho proposed employee. In doubtful casds the Personnel

Director consults with the Vice-President in Charge of the National :

Councils Division and with the Director of Radio Frea Europe. These

three officers of NCFE jointly follow a policy of rojecting candidates

about whom there is the slightest doubt. It {1s to be clearly understood

that in making decisions of this kind the conflicting tnterests and
frantic representations of politically minded exile leaders and groups

are ignored. Acceptance or rejection of candidates is wholly based on

ideclogical security ond talent value.

D. Summary

(1) All nationality desks of RFE at New York and Municn are .

staffed by individuals who hive passed all tests described Abovde

(2) All programs produced and aired by tho nationality desks
are checked and scrutinized by American supervisory personnel for .ideolog-

ical content, audience acceptance and conformity to basic NCFE-RFS policies,

(3) These conditions have been progressively in force since

July, 1950,

RFE POLICY GUIDANCE FOK PERSONNEL

General Comment

The programs alred by RFE are not left to whim or ckunce. All
programs and tho personnel responsible for them are controlled by a

written polioy aanunl. The manual sets forth in minute dotat} the -
position and policy of RFE on every topic beamed to our target countries,
Tho manual is the daily guidance of all employoos, both American and
Exiles doviation from its rules 4s not permitted. Continuous gcrutiny
of nenuscripts and resultant broadcasts is maintained by American om

ployoos to inaure that thero are no deviations.

‘Tho policy manual of RFE reprecenta the conaidored views of
the responsible officials, including the Boerd of Directors, of NCFE.
It fe a statoment of the principses end purposes of NCFE expressed in
operational form. It is conaidered and maintained as a atrictly con-

fidential document, but it is of course availablo for examination by any

proper authority.

| fhe policy manual is in strict conformity with current American

national policies as evidenced by the following quotation from article

Ones 1

"As @ non-governmental radio staticn responsible to
the millions of American citizens who support it,
RFE cannot take a line contrary to United States
Government policy or to tne beliefs of the American
.poople reflected in the Conatitutlon of the United
States and in Arerican Institutions”.

The above quotation 19 understood by exile porsonnel] par=
ticularly to be a sclemn injunction against ideolcgical program content :
which in any way violates tio letter and spirit of Amorican polioy and
ideale. It is 4 guarantoo to the American people and to our captive
Mlstenors tht RFE and tho men who make its programs are unconpron! sirgly'

opposed to tho Comrunict regimes now in power in Soviot Huasia and the _ i
i

satolilty countrios. \

RFE Policy Defined by Handbook (Direct Quotetiona)

1, Tho purpose of RFE 15 to contribute to the liberation of

the Nations imprisoned bohind tho Iron Curtain by sustaining their

morale and stimulating in thom a spirit of non-sooperation with the

Sovlot-dominated regimes by which thoy are, for the time being, ruled. i

2. The central characterietic of RFE is that it is the in-
strumont. of men who ure engaged in fighting for freedom and justico.
As such, it encourages resistance to every tyrant, great and small, in
the countries it addresses. Its speakers speak see ao men of good will
who ssek to contribute to tho elimination of old enmitics and the

building ef en endurirg European democratic order.

3. As a freo forun in which exiles speak to their own people
RFE is particularly dedicated to arguments by which exiles seek to
persuade their listeners of the all devouring ambitions of Soviet

Imperialism, the cruelty and unworkability of Communist Institutions

and the proven advunteges of the denocratic way of life for the worker,

the peusant, the administrator, and the business-and professional

strata of society.

4. RPE tékes counsel with exile leaders and ‘te respectful
of their views, but its policy is not designed to furthor the oapiras

tions of any aingle oxile leader or party.

5. HFE policy is further based upon acceptance of the prin=
ciple that oach of the liberated peoples shall be free to dotermine

for itself the political and social institutions under which it will

live onco it hus been liberated.

6. Finally, the following summary in tho nature of a specific -

“Limitation on program oontont is quoteds

"It is indispensable thut all concerned grasp clearly
that RFE is a multierational station established to
contritute to The liberation of ail the peoples it
addresses, and not rerely of one of those peoples.
RFE policy is therefore commanded by the limitation
that nothing may be said over its fucilities to one
national audience which will destroy the confidence
in RFE of its other audiences or whioh is likely to
induce any of its audiences to:prefer communist rule

tion by a neighboring people.”

Dear Olivers

Wearing ny Crusade hat at this jimcture, let me M11 you in as best I can on
the history and development of the Crusade operating budget. This is no mean
job, since practically all of the transacticns concerning it were verbal -~
a situation I hope to correct in the future, starting now. So here goes. 1
will make the special budget the subject of a separate letter.

In December, Abbott pot the General's verbal approval of a Crusade budget for

1952 of approximately $1,000,000 if Abbott would stay on. Sefore any progress
toward firming up this commitment had been made, difficulties arose in connection
with our position vis a vis VOA. On Janusry 17th, CD and Abbott met with everyone
concerned in the problen in Ed Barrett's office. Out of this meeting came general
agreement that the 1952 Crusade program shculd be considerably reduced in scope,
which was duly reported to the Crusade Board the following day. Allen instructed
Abbott to draw up a proposed budget for samething under $500,000. This Abbott
did under date of Jamary 21st and transaittec it to Allen with a letter dated

Jamary 23rd. . :

The budget sutmitted, which I believe is in your hands, smounted to 21,868,991,
covering the eleven months from February lst to December 31st, 1952. (The
Crusadé had meanwhile received on January lth, on special request, funds covering

the months of December and Jamary.)

-, It was initially contemplated that the total sum of $153,991 should be transferred
to the Crusade in a lump. It then deveicped that because of fiscal year problems
five-elevenths, or $222,270, would be transferred inmediately.

Within a week or so from January 23rd, Abbott received telephonic approval fras
Allen of the $188,991 over-all, with $222,270 to be transferred in a lump sum.

Early in February, Crusade was advised it would be more convenient for you to
transfer just the February allotment anc postzone the luzp sim payment until
March. On advice, we therefore made formal request for $4L,L54 fer February on
Februsry 19th. This payment was received ty us cn March 3rd. It is the cnly
installment we have received against the total (eleven-month) Crusade 1952 budget.
During ny trip before last, I received verbal reassurance tat the balance of

the five-ronth figure would be forthcoming. This then is to urge you to put

this in line for attention as soon as possible.

To recapitulate, thie is a roquest specifically for $177,616, representing
$44,954 a month for March, April, May, and June.

Sincerely yours,

. Hora I, Flew

March-28;-15952

Dear Olivers

This is an attempt to give you the background of our special ZASY BAYER budget.
This is the balloon project, initiated last fall after the first Winds of Freedon
one and scheduled for Christmastixe. It was then knom as Santa Claus or SUGAR
CHARLIE, After definite cancelaticn for Christmas and postzcnement to Easter,
it became known in our accounts as Zaster Bunny or EASY BAER.

In a menorandum to John Danewood, cated Lecember 5, 1951, Abzott said: “Attached,
also, is request to cover costs of operation Santa Claus to date. Except for —
some continuing preparations in the field, this too is being xept on ice pending
further word fron you. You will recall that AWD authorized the purchase of
vehicles, etc., at our conference in his office in October. We estinated at
that tine that the total project would run approximately $175,000.

Formal request to the Foundation for the $51,500 was made Jarmmary 2rd, together
with request for December and Jamiary operating expenses. All tneze sums were
received by Crusade January 10th.

Qn one of Abbott's January or February tripe to your city, he received a promise

to transfer to us the balance of the EASY PAKER budget ($123,500). I would
strongly recommend that this would be the neatest way of handling thie account, va
We naturally keep separate accounting for this budget and could give you an
accounting to date at any time on requect. To make such a transfer now would

also enable you to dispose of this oucget in your current fiecal year, in which

an allocation for it has presumably teen made.

I should perhaps set dow for tke record that it cannot be guaranteed that an

EASY BAKER type operation, when anc if it should be definitely put on the schedule,
ean be carried off for the original budzet of $175,000. There are too many
variables. And, while the major part of the budget spent or to be spent goes

for quasi cazital equipment, same of it goes or will go for expendable operation
(publicity, cormuni¢ations, anc the like) which would have to te repeated in
conrection with another balloon operation.

Attached is a schecule of expensee snd Cuumitments as of Maren Zlet azainst
the EASY BAKER bucget. Fron this ycu will see that we have had to use general
+. operating funds of about 321,000 for LASY BAKER as of that date. A rough estimate
' "of additional costs of-the prayer operation, which belongs to EASY HAYES, is
$9,500. (I also attach for your infcrmation a mimeographed report indicating
the acceptance of the prayer operation among the churches.)

' ' To recapitulate, this is a request for trensfer of the balance of £123,500 of
_ the EASY BAKER special budget.

Sincerely yours,

EXCERITS FROM LETTERS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO .
CRUSADE FOR FRELDOM'S SUGGESTION OF A PRAYER MOVEMENT ,

(Early in March the Crucade sent letters to-evory house of worship in

of Church Women, as vell as to a fow national seculcr organizations. Those
letters urged people to offer special praycrs for those whose relizious
freedoms have been restricted because of Comuntst domination. The Crusade
undortock to make known to the peoples behind the Iron Curtain this movoient
on the part of Americanc and to request their prayers for us in exchanco.
The quotations heroin hich are of a corrratulatory nature to the Crusade ©
are included not out of vainglory, but beccuce they toll part of the

storys the acceptance by the First Letate of this proposal from a lay
organization. On reflection it may be judged that only a ley organization

MEMORANDUM FORs SPC / ;
SUINECTs Leaflet Balloons for use in Paycholosical Warfare

1. On at least four occasions Mr. William Scripps, Detroit News,
directly or indirectly has approached the Government with proposals for
utilization of balloons for psychological warfare. Following is a list
of tho dates and mothod of these approachess

&e 12 October 1950 - Letter from General W. J. Donovan to DCI
enclosing "Operation Ballast.” ‘On 1 November 1950 William HY, Jackeon
responded to this moriorondum to the effect that this suggested opera-
tion was being referred to’ the appropriate persons and suggesting a
subsequent meeting with Donovan to discuss this and other matters,

be In November 1950 as we were undertaking planning for develop-
ment of balloons with General Mills, we wero informed that Mr. Scripps
planned a general meeting to be held in Washington to discuss balloons,
Through the Genoral Millis Washington Representative Mr. Soripps was
persuaded to keep his meeting general and was inforved that the various
agencies of the Government had the matter under conaideration and
considered that it would not be in the public interest at this time
to disclose the nature of their findings, Consequently, Mr. Scripps
forwarded us on 1 December 1950 a proposal "The Use of Free Balloons
for Load Carrying Purposes" which we acknowledged on 11 December 1950,

ee On December 26, 1950 General Smith raveived a letter from
Blair Moody summarising a suggestion from Mr. William Scripps for
encouraging defection of Chinese Communist troops, A routine response
to his letter waa sent 6 January 1951 from Mr. Jackson, J believe
also Mr, Moody called upon the Director in early February of 1951 to
discuss use of balloons for psychological warfare, APC addressed a
briefing memorandum to DCI on 12 February 1951, Subj: Balloons for
Carrying PW Material to Soviet Areas,

2. In Septembor 1950 the NPSB requested that Cla should represent all
interested agencies of this Government and should acconiingly take steps

to develop, procure and stockpile an appropriate number of scientifically
designed balloons for future propaganda use in conditions of international
emergency, At meotinzs of the NPSB on 13 February 1951 and 11 June 1951
4t was agreed that OP€ would procure and stockpile 1,000 large leaflet

balloons for use by the appropriate agency when ani if such use vas
authorised, The Board also agreed that inquiries vhich the various govern-

mental agencies

CMe dea AL

14-00000

w-2a=

" mental ‘agencies might receive concerning use of balloons would be anowored

to the effoct"that the matter is under continuous study by agencies of the
Government but disclosure of results at this time would not be in the public

interest."
3. A perusal of tho NPSB minutes sinse June 1951 did not indicate

further consideration by that group of the subject of balloons. from this
we mst infer that CIA still beara the responsibility of the commitment

made by Mr. Wisnor for procurement.

4 For your information this research and devolopment has been con=
ducted for CIA by General Mills with ONR serving as tho cut-out. An existing

‘ project "Skyhook" which ONR had with General Mills was accelerated to cover

development of vote, balloons continued aleng with ONK's program of comic
ray research, We/obligated to ONR to deny a newspaper access to these
drawings, specifications, movies and reports which bear a SECRET classification.

5e I might make one small suggestion that since Mr, Blair Moody is
now a Senator and running for re-election in the naxt election, it might be
possible to solicite his aid in brinying Mr, Scripps in line with adopted
policy regarding balloons should it become necessary.

COAYVIDEMTIAL

On 7? March, Wilitem Ceripps of the Detroit Neva, called and asked for price
eotimate in lots of 100,006 of a carrier balloon syotem which vould carry

300 pounds great distances. On discussion, it epyeered that ho was in- —
terestod in something e-yutvalent to our interin eysten, 80 IT told him we had
mode a quotation on such: a ploce of equipeent in quantities for prices in the
ranve of 2356 a unit. Tis plece of e,ulpowent under the expected vind con-
Gition, should carry 15) pounds 150u mileo and deliver it with the vest possible

accuracy fron a balloon veLicle.

I avl:ed bin if be vanted specifications, but he said he would get these leter.

Ye wau working with a group vio would use thes to carry propaganda, and he would
geo us in two weers, acd then vould discuss an¢ obtain exhibits, It vas pointed
out to hin that this equfyoent and polyetiylere were well controlled by the
goverment. Tida eppeared t+ be no problec to hin. _

Scripps called again on 14 Varch, and esked 1f ve could atterd a luncheon in
Detroit Wednesday noon, the 2nd of April, end then go on to New York for a
luncheon Thursday noon. Ys asied that ve bring along data, cost estinates,
exhibits, end all solea data, ey vell as movies, to this meeting. 1 asked if
this had beer, cleared with ALLott's frierdz, and he d4dn't appear to know wht
I was talking about. 1 told hin that some clearance would nee to be obtained
before vither the year wan ehown, or before 1t would be permitted to leave the
country. UOcripps is rost entiuslastic aicut support forthconing to carry suck
an operation forvard, ad felt that the State Lepartment would interpose no

objections for the procran plamed.

Seripps aaked that we confirm on 19 Harch whether or not you and I would be

able to attend. This I promised to do. I would also like your guidance es

to what course sheild be gurssed in this. It in believed that certainly Datley
or Gates Lloyd atould ve xade avare of this effert, so that we may deport
ourselves accordizgly. Incidentally, Cewey ard Alry wiil be at both seetings,

which took place today and covered the following itomss

7 1. At the su:sestion of Bob Lang, seconded lator hy NUFE's

. Chairman, Joseph Grew, Adulral Miller wants to nold at Une Princeton
Inn on the Web and llth of May a peneral discussion of United Statea
policy toward Iron Curtain countries, with particular emphasis upon
what now lines, if any, Radio free Europe chould take. ‘{ho background
of this, acconting to Admiral Miller, is that Lany and others within
RFE feel that tho Line is running out behind the Tron Curtain, that
the people are ready for mvolution and Urat wo cannot continue much
longer the "hold everything" line. 4 want to gauvler 2 jroun of
experts, including liessrs. Wisner and Dulles, to diseuss what policy
. . we should now adopt. :

I see no reason why wa shouldn't have sue: a ceneral bull session

2. Admiral Miller recontly had a talk with Frank Altschul who
complained somewhat of his treatment at tua hands of NCiE and CIA,
saying that he iad never even had so mucn as a 'wormt of thanks tor
the work ho did. Miller suggested that the OPT mirht want to write
such a Leiter and taat, if so, a similar letter should go to Dowitt

Dear Nines

A little ineidont has caused a bit of trouble and a flurry of
eables hore that I think you can correct very quickly. Spencer
Poenix's assistant, Mr. Hiller, haa written to Leon Dennen telling
Dennen that Miller has been called in by our chop and questioned in
detail about recent Dennen accounting.

hhether or not he was quostioned in detail 15 a matter on which ~

be and I might disagree tut is really of no conesquence since tho
accounting by Dennen should normally go tirough us to Hiller, and I
think you would agree that we nad a right to ask questions about it.
What bothers ma a little, however, 1s Miller's writing to Dennen,
giving details of how our to offices work together. Dennen, it

turns out, was annoyed ty the content of Alllerts letter, not eo

mech at Hiller as at us. “His anitoyance is misplaced but if there

head been no mention ty Killer of detsils of our relationship thore

would have been no annoyance.

; I presume you know of Pennen'a close affiliation with Lovestone
and the possibility that this mall thing will reverberate around
amd around the usual vicious circle. Can you explain to Xilter how
these little incidents can get blown up into big issues and ask hin
te use a little sore discretion in tae fature?

Sinserely,

Paris, Marcn 3, 1952

wa

Dear Bob,

- I have not done much reporting on cur Cerven
negotiations for suveral reasons; first, tere was not
much to report and, second, whatever there waa Dick Condon
undertook to forward from Munich. I did write C.D. @
couple of lotters cutlining our delaya ani sone of our un]
certainties, and last week I cabled him thac J would send
a nore detalled narrative when J got to Paris. As he is
now technically no longer President of NCFE, and a2. Admiral
Miller may not have been completely informed of all thatw
are trying to do, I am adiresring this to you, with copy to

@ach of thames

‘Yn the first place, let me say that progress
during the last half of last week was surprisinsly speedy
and encouraging. There sre stil! ‘any opportunities for
the well known ®slip 'twixt the cup and the lip’, and local
Gerran political evonsiderations coulc roar their ugly heads
at any woment. J think it must algo be understood that, as
Dick Condon puts it, no satter now many nor how good written
agroe“ents we may ‘have covering our operstions, the whole
RFE enterprise in Ger-anywill have ty be played pretty much
by oar once the contractual agrzuments take effect. I raeurd
this, however, as an inescapadle risk, and Y ventit. it now
only to exphasize the parctount importance of the utzvost care
in programming and {in ecndiet to evol.! a boror wiich could
upset our entire apple-cart., The very favorable repert eich
your friend Asher Lee made after his hurried inspe-tion of
Mundeh underlines tn- need for regular spot check on program
output to avoid howlers, and the neec for this once our
Pelationship with tne Ger.sns is ne loncser through the Occu-
pation Authorities or HICOG is even nore imperative,

Dick Condon s-nt you from Munich the text of the
proposed Suncespost license which we acrecd on with Dr,
Schuster on Fe: rucry 19, 1952, and this should long aince
have reached yous

Qur Bonn ne otfations resulted in the accerntance

of this text, with two exceptconss
1) Sub-clazuse 2 of article JI is cli-inated, You

wilt resemder trat the Rindespost wishac’ to

insert a provision aut.orizing License cunceilation if RPE

shou.d :rosceast anytring which @ft will te tne opinion of
the Federal Governzent tat tio transmissions will prejudice
14-0000

the interest of tha Fecurni Nepulic®, Wea objected to this

O% two grcounisg

a) thet such provision had no logical place in
a technical License, and .

=p) that 1t nods ar position far too procarious
. since {t uxposed us to license cance! lation
practically at the whim of any Geran bureaus

craty,

and we persuaded Pr. Schuster to lenve it out of tha liconse
and let us discuss the problem at Bonne At Bonn, we vere
fortunately able to persuade the Foratin Office officials
that guch a provision hid no technicel place in tha liconse,
and tnat whatever shoulc he seid on the subject sould be
said in an oxchanie of latters, or the eculvalent, batvcen
the Yoreiin Office and ourseives, Accordingly, Article IT

. now contains but on: clause,

2) Guestion was reiscd by the Poreizn Office

ofricials at Bonn ragardine the lereth of the
license. Thetext Dick sent you provides for validity until
August 32, 1960. The reason I chore that cate wes that it is
the expiration date of our lease on the Yolzxirchen transe
mitrer site, ant J thought tiat if 45 arbitrary tora were to
va fixed that tying it In with the flolzkirchen lease gave it
a@ plaugisility which wonld hels acceptance @ and thet provod
to te the case so far a3 the Sundespost was concerned,

The Foreisn Office people told us, however, that
numerosus cuestions had been sexed in the Bundestag regarding
RPE and its progeems, anc that for the dovern-ent to give us
@ license for a3 long a3 eirht years would cause serious
criticism, We are a peculiar sort of animal, anyway, and
for our irregular activities to ve vlessed with such long
term anzroval would, they thought, be unwise for buth their
and our soints of view, accordingly, they sussssted « foure
327 Periods J counterod with five, datin: from the date of

Jeense issuance which (since 1¢ cannot take placu before

the contractual asrecannts becore erfective, may well be late
in 1952) will give us consideratly nore tran five years life
expectancy. My ov feeling fs that ir we have not cone our
job within five years, we might as woll pull dovm the shade
and go home, In any case, my counter proposal was, «2 J said,
accepted, and Article JII of tne license wili now reads

‘

®Tnis license shall be valid for a pertod

of five years com encing witn the «te of
its issuance ant vill be automatically
extenied tuereefter frot year to year unless
written notice of ter {nation f9 given by
one psrty to the ot'or not lesa tian 95 days
prior to the next eypiration datc,®

we mre an am

‘ \ .
So such for the License, tne terms or vhich were
shown to our HICOG frienda and regsrded by then ag highly

favorable.

Our political discussions suffered fro~ a variety
of frustrations, Wa sxrecd on the licens: terms wit!, the
Bundespost on Fubrusry 19th, and an azroiatcent wes made for j
us to soe Pr. Lenz = the oflici.l to whom foctor Adenauer
had referred our preblens = as noon on Thursday, Februsry 21,
1952. Dick ani 1, tnereforo, tk an early train from
Frankfort and were met at the Bonn station by Fritz Kenpner
who told us that the srpointhuent hid bean caneolied as Cr,
Leng had been called to the Chancullery on an urgent matter,
Fritz said that he hs! bean told that if vc weet to Dre
Lenzts office, hia assistant would make a definite nppointe
ment for us later. VWs cid this, ani were received by a smocth
and noneco:;-ittal insividual, wo said he would not be in
touch with Dr. Lens until nine otclock tint evening, and could
not make any cerinite dato until after he hai spoxen with

Lene

I had the very uncomfortable feeling that ve were
bdaing given a runearound, and Frits was very much annoyed.
We finally got the young chap to agres that he woul trv to
reach Lenz before evening, and that wa would tals hone hin
aguring course of tre afternoon to know what infor-ztion he
had been able to obtains We telephoned repcatedly, tut the
answer was always the sires "nothing to repert™. Dick and T,
therefore, took tre train buck to Fr.n«fort, while Prits
stayed in Bonn ant, in tro evening, ha tele honed thet he had
finally got soze infcr-ation fro« Lenz! young assistant that
Lenz had turned the entire ~atter over to a recular Poreif¢n
Ofrice ofricial nated stroha, and that we were to rake arran-
genents to see Strohm, Fritz said that he has endeavored to
dv this, but had teen told by strohats office thet ha could
not be sure to sce us until T-ursday, the 78th, although
Vednesday, tha 7th, waa a aligt.t possibility.

As 1 think I vrote C,P., tic Fasching colebrations
vere resching thair climax ov- > that veekend, and the first
two dvys of th> next verk, and f hav> no souct that Strohats
unavailability was, to zs certcin extent, relate” to Fasching.
Frite seid that curing his vistt to tn: Forel n Office bullde

decoritions, so that even the hicheat ovictals apparantly
tske Pasching sericusly. Not wantine to -axe another fruite
less trip ta Ronny I cecige: wa voulc accept Strohm's appointe

went for Thursday, Fesrurry ieth.

At 10.50 AM on Thursday, Ye‘ runry 22th, Dick, Fritz

or tne German authorities for anytcing broadcast from Gerzan
soll, of tie importance of German certicipstion in cot-rmining
program content, of the dangers of arousing refugee ant:gonism,

and so on and sc forthe

After an hour of this, Iowar ready to call it a day
and sugvest that wa come back wien v2 evul¢ talk to Strohm
but, fortunately, at that moment Strohm ca-e In and the entire
atmosphere changed. He apoiogizec premisely = and enuarently
sincerely - Yor tho delay, exprasse: hinself anxious to co-
operate in every possiole vay to meet our reculreventa,
brushed aside sone of the technicaiitios raised by Brucker,
ang got dow, to the essentials very rapidly. We vent over
the ground we had previously gone over with Bruckner, we exe
plained our -urpose an! kept our feet fairly firmly planted
on the principles which we referdec as tesi¢, The result of
our long discussion was substantisl avreesent on the two

things that scattered roasts

a) license term of five years, and

bd) no unquilifiod cancelintion richt of the kind
first euc. ested by the Buncespost, and more
or less Inaisted uson by Bruckner,

Tne sree of ozresmcnt wes se broad that we sucvested
an adjournment to per it us to nut in writing the aressent

AP. Phenix stated that the NCFE hed been founded in

‘1949 by a group of private Auerican citizens aninated by

the desire to engourxge by positive measures the eventual
Liberation from the oonaunist yoks of tha peoples of the
enelaved countries. of Sentral and Eastern Europe, He
oxplained that with the help of endowments and publis
contritutions to the Cruesde for Freefon, the Comittee had
undertaken, saongy ite other astivities, the operation through
Ra@io Pree Europe of radio broadossting installations through

Woleh 4@ dleeeminated to listcners in the Iron Curtain

the furtherance of ites objectivea. He pointed out thas
Radio Free Europe hed conatruated and vas precently op=
erating tranesnitter etations at Holskirchen end Biblia, hed
erected a lars studio and office building in Hunich and nain=
Gained a lerge monitoring estobliehmeng et Sehlessgheim and
that ite prograne were prepared vith the help of lesding

effected by the HCFE:the eecupation of that Zone

by the U.8 Army and that the operations of RFE had been, and
wore being facilitated by the U.8 Arny authorities because of
FFE's etatus as an accredited Anerican information

agency. He observed that the NCFE ves concerned lest the
termination of the Occupation Status would, in the absenca
of specific agreenent with the Federal German Republic, re=
sult in haspering the work of RFE and fapairing tts effect
ivenses, and that, with the approval of the Department of
Btate, negotiaticna had been carried on vith the BPMin which
had resulted in agreement os te the terns of a license which
would be granted by the BPKin to NCFE innediately upon the
termination ef the Occupation Statute. A copy of that license
4a appended hereto,

Hr. Phenix called attention to the fast thas this lisense
dealt with the technical aspects of RFE's radio broadcast
operations and that there vere several non=teohnical matcers
Wiich required clarification before the ECFE would feel
juetified in undertaking the long rence program it haa under
consideration,

Dre stated that the objectives and purposes
of NCFE, 1a the realization of whieh RFE was enraged, vere
objectives and purpeses to which the Federal Government itself
wae unalterably coanitted, The negotiations for a BPhin
license had been conducted with his full knowledge and approval.
Be was woll aware that by licensing RFE'’s operation in flermany,
fully cognisant of the objectives and purposes of that operation,
the Federal Governzen® was on the ene hand encouraging the ,
expenditure by SCFE for that operation of large suns of aoney

was giving NCFE an. assurance that RVE's operation in Germany
would not be interfered with, buS on the contrary would be

" fagklitated and helped by the Federal Goverment,

From his viewpoint there was only ene reservation he had
to make: RFE would be expected to refrain from using ite vroade
oaet facilities on Ceruen soil for the purpose of advocating
end promoting political enda whieh the Federal Governuent con=
sidered in conflict with ite ewn bagio policies, Hence, the
Voderal Goverment. would have the right, officially to aotify
NCPE through the Foreign Office of any such conflict. Shauld the
German atations of KEE thercupen not refrain froa advocating
and prouoting the policies toe which the Federal Gevernsent had
objected, the Foderal Government would have no choice but to
require the surrender by NCPE of {ts licenee and the dicoontinudnoe
of ite vroadcast operations fro: Geraan territory.

Ny, Phenix stated that he understood the reasons for ms
the views expreased by Dr. » accepted his reservation,
and agreed to the procedure outlined, and that to provide a
factual basis for the consideration of any question which night
arise in respect of RFE broadcasts the latter vould keep on
file for a period of 30 days froc the cate of use all tapes
recording prograss broadcart frozn RFE traneiaitters in Gernany
so that any queertioned prorram would be avatlable to the appro=
priate German aut}.orities when requested ny them ur. Phenix
then emphasized the importance attached by NCFE to certain other
amecta of the opereting pro>lene ef RFE, for exemplet

(a) thet prenerty of NCFE brourht into Germany prior

Dr. atated that he recornized the Laportance of
