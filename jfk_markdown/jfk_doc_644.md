Rafael wes essacs{natad at
about ten p.m. on the Night of 30 May 1961. It was Trujilio's
custom to visit one of his mistresses at kis ranch at Can Cristobal

about cuce a week. Cn most of his travels he rode in a Carysler

with bullet-proof glass and vith security guards riding in accompanying

cars. » Cepartel from this practice on his periodic trips to San
Cristobal and substituted a nigaly stereotyped pattern of action:
after his nightly walx, he disissed his companions; changed into a
Khaki uniforn; aad set out for San Cristocel in an unescorted 1957
Chevrolet, always driven by the sare chauffeur.

On the nignt of the slaying, the Chevrolet was intercepted on
a four-lane highvay on the outskirts of Ciudad Trujillo by eight
armed assassins in three cars. Trujillo vas killed by gunfire, and
his body was removed from the scene by the assassins. Trujillo's
chauffeur was seriously wounded, was left behind by the assassins,

and survived. All of the assassins escaped from the scere. (Gne was

never caught and vas eventually granted amnesty. Two vere killed

‘while resisting arrest. Tre others | ..were arrested, confessed,.

and were later executed teZore coming to trial. About eight or nine

others, wa sere in on or kmew of the plot but did not perticizate

in the actual assassination, were killed

e in custcdy, walle

vesisting arrest, or by suicide to avoid arrest and torture.

(Mote: We use the term “plotters” to refer to all of those involved
in this attespt to overthroy Trujillo. “tssassins” refers to the
small group that actually did the killing.)

Eventually, after the surviving plotters were granted amnesty,

many of the details came cut. Norman Call, a reporter with the

San Juan Star, wrote an article thar appeared in Tne New PR

ublic

issue of 13 April 1963. Excerpts follow:

The assassination of the Dominican Republic's Rafael L.
: Trujillo was carried out with assistance from the US Central
; . Intelligence Agency. Ams for the May 30, 1961 Slaying of the
. 69-year-old dictator on a ‘onely stretch of highwayaear his
: capiial were smuggied by tne CIA into the country at toe
‘ request of the assassins.

Tne CIA began shipping arzs to the Dominican Rezublic in .
late 1980, following a series of tals between US Consul Henry
Dearborn, Chief Political Officer John Parfield of the US
Consulate, and Luis Aniama Tio. Also involved in the plot was .
Antonio Imbert, who had been Governor of Porto Plata province.

As Trujillo's political and financial problems deepened,
talks continued between Dearbon, Parfield and leaders of the
anti-frujillo conspirecy. Toward the end of 1960, contact vas
established between Amiama and a CIA agent who... was
named Plato Cox.

°
The key link between the assassins and the CIA in the arms

Shipments was‘a long-tine American civilian resident of Ciudad i

Trujillo, Lorenzo Berry, otherwise know as "dinpy," who operated ‘

@ supermarket in a fashionable neighborhood where Trujillo also

lived. "Wimpy" was put under brief arrest after the willing but

was later allowed to leave the country. -
The weapons vere imported in small parts, to be assembled

dater by the plotters, anong the roucine grocery shitments ?or

the supermarket arriving regularly in the capital's port. The

ae en rmnerernenar
Gena.
gua parts eacered the Repudlic in sractally-carked food cans,
watch were later turned over to the conspirators.

Plans 2or the intended assassination vere worked out during
the same-yeriod-in.weich the abortive assault.on Cuba was. being,
prepared. Eswever, when the CIA-crganized April 17,.1961, —
invasion at tze Bay of Pigs failed and world attention was”
focused on Washington's complicity in that operation, a post-
ponement of the attempt on Trujillo's life was ordered because
of tne embarrassment enother such failure might cause the
,United States. .But the order to hole up cane too late. The
needed weapdéas vere already in the hands of the conspirators; te
who refused eppeals Wy Déarborn and Barrield to delay the
. assassination. They insisted oa moving at the first opportunity.
Tals came on May 30; -whea frujillo and his chauffeur drove out
into the coumtry in an. unescorted.1957 Chevrolet fora
rendezvous at a San Cristotal estate, la Fundacion, with
Trujillo's 2)-year-o1d mistress, Mons Sanchez.

It can be reported on excellext authority that close
associates of the slein dictator key of the US role within
a few days following the killing. ; ; .

Dearborn, Barfieid-and Berry bad meanwhile been rushed ,
out of the Doninican Republic by-US officials. . ...- .
Since tue ouster of the Trujillos, serry ("wimpy") has
returned to operate his handsomely appointed supermarket,
where he greets customers with calz and courtesy, as if
. Trujillo: had-never- lived...

- We interviewed Richard Bissell (then DD/P), J. C. King (then |

Chief, WH Division), and J. D. Esterline (then Chief of Operations,

Wi Division). King recalls the Agency's role as veing limited to

. monitoring interzal plotting against the Trujillo regime "but.not

“pu hing or instigating.” Esterline, like King, recalls that the -

gency was not directly involved in coup plotting. He described the,- oo

interest. Ee deserioed the affair es "a faiziy normal operation
involving neetings, discussions, and formal approvals." We do not
have firm information as to whether or not any of the weapons
supplied by CIA vere actually used in the assassination of Trujillo.
Both Esterline and King believe they vere not. Bissell, nowever,
has ¢ a vague impressicn that oae or them was.

From the record the course of

jy

U.S. policy | with respect to the overthrow of Trujillo. We also can
, ascertain from the files the rature and the extent of U.S. support :
ef che plotters, including the passing to trem of veapons out cf the
U.S. Consulate. in Ciudad Trujille. What ve cannot discover. from the
files, despite quite massive documentation, is how the coup group

wes organized. The best single account ve find, and it is not wholly

accurate, is in ea book by Robert Crassveller.* The main flaw in
the story is its failure to identify the individuals with whon the
vs. “Goverment vas ‘actually working. Excerpts follow:
qhe plot was organized on the basis of two groups of.
conspirators linked together by a liaison that later proved

too fragile to bear the stresses laid upon it. Each group
had its purpose and its separate personnel.

The function of the Action Group wis to assassinate
Trujillo and immediately present proof of its succes, i in
the form of Trujillo's corpse, to the second group, the
Political Group. The latter would then launch a coup, ;
taking over the machinery of the government and the Armed -

: Forces.

; The Action Grovp coasistea of eight men. “It appears to
‘ “have been organized originally ty General Antonio Inbert
Barreras and Salvador Estrelle. . .-. . . They were joined
" by Lieut. Amado Garcie Guerrero, a member of the military
. corps attached to Trujillo in the National Palace; Antonio
@e la Maza, the brother of Octavio de la Maza, who had been
xdlled by the goverment because of his involvement in the

Caliztez case; Euastar Tejeda; Roberto Pastoriza; and Pedro
Livio Celens. The elz neater, Manuel Caceres Tuati, sas in

‘he Political Group bad d.less distinct membership. :t
incluged Luis Anmiaza Tis, Modesto Diqz, Ceceral Juan Texas
Diaz, and several others. At the very top it had the support
of Geseral Roman Fernandes, Secretary of State for the Arzed
Forces, and his brother Bibin. ....: -

Tne over-all authority appears to: have centered petactraily te 7 i me
in General Diaz, probably the only ome wero had sufficleat j :
prestige to command authority. .... «

“,. he Action Group would remain in caily readiness. When
information in the Palace indicated that Trujillo was going
to drive ty Estancia Fundacion . . . Garcia Guerrero in the
Palace would inform the others by personal message. - + + + «

Tae expected messege frou Garcia Guerrero in the Palace
came to the patient plotters at seven o'clocs on the evening
of May 30. They were not fully prerared and coordinated. at
this moment, but the emotional and impetuous de la Maza £
threatened. to act by himself if the others lagged... Ia-.any.
event, the plan vent into execution. . .. . . Each of then
had his revolver or pistol, and de la Maza also had his om
saved-off shotgun and teo M-1 semiautcratic rifles. .....

_. ,The conspiracy began to come apart within an hour. Never
very professionally contrived, the plot was hastened prematurely
to its culzination by the impatience of de la Maza, and it was
now afflicted with tad luck and ineptitude. Immediately after
_ the assassination, the wen of the Action Group were unable to

reach Ceneral Roman. .... . Cae We pany

The Political Group of the conspiracy never took up its
planned role. ‘The Action Group scattered, leaving 2 treflas. _ fot

Shai areata Pe

Toe FoI report of its interviews of Ortiz, the SIM4 investigator,
.. gives. an excellent account of way the plot fell wpart after the -

assassination took place. One of the assassins, Pedro Livio Cedeno,

was: cerlously wounded (probably. by | fire from his own coapanions).

\ All of the assassins assembled at General Diaz' house after tae

killing. One of them called a friend, Dr. Robert Reid Cabral, to
treat Livio. Dr. Reid found him so badly injured that surgery would
be required. Reid ard two of the assassins took Livio to a hospital.

.

While in deliriwm he mumbled the names "de la Maza” ead "Juan .

Tomas.” The police immediately picked up two brothers of Antonio
de la Maza. Neither was personally involved in the plot, but both
knew the details and the names of most of the assassins. General
Diaz, Antonio de la Maza, and Lieut. Garcia Guerrero vere killed .
resisting arrest. Aniama and Imbert went into hiding and survived.
The rest were caught and interrogated followiagtorture. All
confessed.

” The ‘iad led to identi fication of Fersons who vere in

” or on the. fringes of the Political Group: General Roman and his
brother, Aniana Tio, General Garcia’ Urbaez, General Guarionex
Estrella, Tomas Baez Diaz, Modesto Diaz, and Miguel Angel Baez Diaz.

The assassination itsele and the plotting preceding it took

place ‘against a’ background: of international acvivity in. opposition
to the Trujillo regime, with both the CAS and the U.S. taking clear-
cut stands. ‘These are some of the highlights: :

Two documents provide a useful point of cepdcure, from an

historical point of view. One is a seni-official letter from

Ambassador Farland in the Dominican Republic to Assistant

Secretary of State Rubotton. The other document is an internal
CIA staff paper gevealing the relatively passive role that had

been played by CIA prior to 1960.

16 Novemter 1959
eee ood

_ Ambassador Farland wrote an "Official-Informal" menorandum
to Rubotton reporting that "the uxderground is more active today
than ever in the history of the Trujillo regime." He described the

principal opposition Group as being about 2,000 strong.

He said:

: « « + within this group there is growing militant anti-
American feeling based on the premise that the United States
should actively aid the Dominican revolutionary (sic) for the
overthrow of the Trujillo regime. Discussions I have heard on
this subject show an appalling lack of uncerstanding of the
position of the United States ana its adovied doctrine of non-
intervention. .... . This group is in possession of
clandestine broadcasting equipment which will 80 into operation
when the strike is made. CAS has been inforsed and Joins with

j This is the date of the first draft that appears in Agency files
, of a plan to Yersuade Trujillo to retire.

The originator of the draft
‘Is not show, but it was to be forwarded to President Eisenhower

from General Edwin Clark, a friend of the President from their years :

of military service. ‘The plan was for Clark to approach Trujillo,

with whom he hed been on good terms in the Past, and attempt to

This proposition received hign-level atteation in Washington,
including that of President fisenhower, Secretary of State Eerter,

and Allen Dulles. In approving Clark's appreach to Trujillo,

the President specified that Clark showld travel as a representative

¢ — of the State Departzent, rather than as a personal emissary of the
t

cd ” President. General Clark traveled to the Dominican Republic and

_ met with Trujillo on 27 March. By the tice of the meeting it
appears that it had been decided that the Plen vould te presented
as merely that of private citizen Clark, and that was what

was core.

A menorandum written of a debriefing of Ambassador Farland reads,
in part, as follows:

"The dissidents need gms and ammunition fren the United
States. In particular they need a ssall mumber of high-povered :
rifles with telescopic lenses. ‘he Ambassador said that he saw
no problem in the purchase and Gelivery Clandestinely of the
@rms to the dissidents. But he said, of course, this raises
the question of whether the U.S. Goverment wants to engage in i
this activity. :

"col. King said that this of course is a policy decision. He
said that CIA could Geliver the arns if this is the group we want . j
to support.

(Cument: Farland was in Washingtoa for consultations.
Althouga ke is listed as having served as Anbassador unth: 23
June 1950, it appears that he aia not aztually return to duty
in Ciuded Trujilio. Tits successor, Vinton Chapin, was nominated

13 June, but he never took the post.)
3 June 1960

Farland ret with Nelson H. Snith, the Dominican desk officer
in WH Division. They compared lists of dissidents to see if the
names CIA had were those with whom Farland nad been Gealirg. Farland
said, "Those are the boys all right.” Saith's memorandum of the

meeting inclutes this ccrment:

"Farland then told me that the underground opposition are
‘planning to assassinate Trujillo. Ee said that it is placced to
use a powerful bomb which could be planted along the rouve of
Trujillo's nigntly walk and could be detonated by a rezote-
control firing device. He intinated that this plan is pretty
well along and could be executed at any time."

Undated Working Paver (filed between Papers dated 25 May end 13 June)

The author is not identified nor is there aay indication that
the proposal was approved. Tis objective was stated thus: "fo

precipitate the downfall of the Trujillo regime by 1 August or as

Soon as possible thereafter.” It proposed that the U.S. beccze a

prime motive force against the Trujillo regime. "In the event Trujillo

Gzadline of 1 July was proposed for cempleting arrangements.

17 Sune 1950

Henry Dearborn, who vas in charge in the Ambassador's absence, :
queried State through CLA channels, asxing for con@irmation on
certain points for a meeting he was having wlth a dissident leader,
Dr. Jordi Brosse. He stated his understanding of the U.S. position
as follows:

ri a. Toe U.S. is not prepared to take overt action ageinst
age the Trujillo government while it is in full control.

b. The U.S. is prepared to assist the opposition clandestizely
to develop effective forces to accomplish Trujillo's overtarcy.

c. Assistance must continue to be channeled covertly :
until such tine as the dissidents establish a provisionsi
goverment which controls a substantial section of the
Deainican Pepublic.

20 Jue 1960

Dearborn, again through CIA channels, asked Rubottom and Farland

if he could make the same statements concerning U.S. policy ina

meeting with Juan Vicini, another dissident leader. Farland replied

in the affirzative.

mounted sinultareously with the Cuban operations. . 2...
it was egreed that the plan is worth beginning at this tine

Headquarters pouched to the station a copy of Holman's mesorendim
of his meeting, ith Vicini and Reid. On 4 March, the chier of Station
cabled his assesment of the plan to intercept Trujillo's entourage
and kill hin with guns and grenades: ,

“"Vicini idea . . . alzost certain fail if applied. that
type attack is precisely what bodyguards appear test qualified
cope with. Their defense prttern and displacement vehicles
Plus police practice detour traffic blocks away fron entourage
make Vicini idea fatally childish in Owen's view."

(Comment: The assassination vas actually carried out
through a variation of this scheme. The assassins detected and
took advantage of a stereotyped patter in Trujillo's moverents

in which he rode at night, unescorted, on little traveled highways.)

‘ _ To recap: ;
( a. Assistant Secretary of State Rubottom told J. C. King
‘ : ; on 28 Juse 1960 that the U.S. Goverment vas prepared to partici-
pate in the overthrow of the Trujillo regine to the extent of
providing a small mmter of sniper rifles for the removal of
key Trujillo people from the scene. Ceneral Cabell, as Acting
DCI, on 1 July 1966 approved delivering 12 Springrield rifles to
the Dosinican dissidents by air drop or by sea. The rifles
were never delivered.

b. On 10 February 1951 the chie? of station cabled a

Suggestion that one sxall-size, nigh-fire-pover weapon be

forwarded in each pouch. This Suggestion was not acted upon.

of Consul General ‘Dearbon for the _Poucking of° three B caliber...
Seith ast Wesson S Special pistols for delivery to key members

of the dissident group. Headquarters was preparing to pouch

a. On 26 Hazch 1961 the station casled a- request for

permission to | pass varee sen{-autonatic MeL carbines Plus

ammunition to Dr. Severo Cabral. The carbines and ammunition

vere in the consulate, having been left by departed naval personnel. -

‘the station requested that headquarters pouch magazines. Head-

. ‘quarters approved passing the carbines and ammunition -and “~pouched~

the magazines. The cable authorizing passing the carbines’ was
released by the DD/P (Bissell). ‘he station said at would file
off the ‘carbines’ serial numbers. ‘the station cabled that the

carbines” were’ passed to "Wimpy" Berry by the station! 8 , female

administrative assistant on 7 April 1961. , Berry, at the request

of the dissidents, gave tke carsines to S. Thomas Stocker for

: temporary safbkeeping. Berry later recovered the carbines fron

Stocker and gave them to Antonio de Ja Maza, who reportedly kept

them in the trunk of his autozobile. It is protable that et least

one of the caroines was taken to the scene cf the assassination

“ by de la Maza, but we have no evidence that itiwas actually used
‘in the shooting. Ortiz, the SI{ investigator, ‘told the FBI ‘that
the assassins who were apprehended and interrcgated spoke only
of the firing of a sawed-off shotgun, revolvers, and pistols.

e. While at headquarters for consultations in early April
1061, Chie? of Station Robert Conn evidently prevailed upon
headquarters, to pouch four M3 submachine guns and ammunition
to the station. The submachine guns were pouched and arrived
at the station on 19 April 1961. Headquarters cabled the station”
on 17 April that the submachine guns were not to be passed to

; the dissidents without additional headquarters approval. . Despite

"" yepeated pleas from the Chief of Station and from the Consul
General, Washington continued to refuse authorization to pass

them. We think it is safe to conclude that the. submachine guns

‘were never passed to the dissidents.

A final, and rather sorry, footnote: We do not know the

motivations of. men-such as: Jordi Brossa, Juan Vicini, Severo Cabral,.
Aniama Tio, and Antonio Imbert. The SIM interrogations of the plotters
