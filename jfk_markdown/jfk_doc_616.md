_ 2, Althovgh such designation under present statutes iv.viewad favurably
by most persons; the regulation governing this retirement system gives the
individual the right to.appeal auch 2 determination if he deems the designs+
tion adverse. to hia best: interests, In order that this technical requirement
yj notitied ot your rizht to appeal, An dppoal

questions that you may have in connection with your designation that cannot
be anawerod by referring to t00% Dispatch 5696 should be forwarded to Heads

3, @ believe. that the benefite of the .-rganization Ketirement system
aro superior to the benetits of the Civil nervice etiramen: oystem, howe
ever, there arg & few situations in which an employee at at the time of retires

: ment may have so many yeara of service (almost 37) that he would receive a

higher Snnuity ander.the Civil service system, because of this, the policy
decision has been made that a participant in the « rganisation system wha.

-would roceive a higher annuity under the Civil service system may, not.later

than one year prior to his rctiremeat, apply to be romoved from cur system
and (ransferred to the Civil Lervice system, Thus, you should not anticipate

" this contingency ae a factor in deciding whether you regard your designation

as a participant adverse to your best interests,

COMMENTS OF REVIECNG OFFICIAL
I concur in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on duties No. 2, 3 and 4.
I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than "strong,"
‘with justification, I also think, however, that duty No. 1, involving the overall
-adminiatration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more
appropriately be rated "proficient, '' or perhaps "strong."

r concur. in the evaluations given Mr.’ Harvey ‘on duties No. 2, 3 and 4.

I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated outstanding” rather than "strong,"
with justification. I also think, however, that duty No. 1, involving the overall

administration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more
appropriately be rated "proficient," or perhaps "strong.'
