1. FT recommend that Lee H, Wigren be promoted from GS-13
to GS-14. Mr. Wigren has been in grade since May 1962 and is
now a GS-13, Step 8. He Currently occupics a GS-15, Operations
Officer, Branch Chief position. : .

2. Mr. Wipren was born 1 December 1923, Ile received a:

BA degree in Russian Studies from Yale University in 1947 and.
an MA degree in History from Harvard University in L950. ie

, entered on duty with CIA as a GS-06 clerk in March 19$1. He

. Officer in 1952 and since that time has served variously as

Intelligence Officer, Arca Operations Officer, Biographics
Officer, Instructor, and Operations Officer in DIV/D, Europe
Division, SE Division, OTR, and since’ 1968 the Counterintelli-
“gence Staff.

3. Most of Mr. Wigren's career has involved CE and CI
matters. He has been primarily concerned with various aspects
-of the Counterintelligence research and analysis activity of -

SE Division and, since 1968, the Counterintelligence Staff.

In the course of his various assignments, he has developed a
broad and deep substantive Knowledge of the Soviet intelli-
gence and security organs and their activities which has made
him one of our more knowledgeable: and effective CI analysts.
"le is careful and thorough in his research, he writes well,
and he has an established reputation within and without CIA

as an interesting and effective lecturer concerning counter-
intelligence matters. His career record reflects a consistently
professional performance of above-average quality in his vari-
ous CIA assignments. Additionally, that record is documented
by several letters of appreciation. from other US Government
agencies and foreign liaison services for the highly profes-
sional assistance provided then by Mr. Wigren in the counter-
intelligence field.

— . . Ste

2.
. Me. Wigren is currently Chief -of the External
- Branch of the Cl Research and Analysis Group. He
erming the duties and responsibilities of this §S-1S
in a satisfactory manner, He naniages the complex
~ eS'of six staff officers and nine contract person-
eciated with this Branch and is responsible for. the
research programs in which they are involved. fie
strives to direct and combine the best talents of the person-
. nel unger his supervision toward the achievement of his
. objectives while remaining sensitive to the. personal
ver interests of his employees. -He is especially effec-
“ dealing with the several contract personnel (including
defectors) under his supervision who, because of their
pro Sional status and diverse ethnic backgrounds, some-
times require especially understanding treatment,
3. In summary, Mr. Wigren is effectively and satis-
factorily performing the duties of a GS-15 Branch Chief in a
position which requires specialized stibstantive knowledge
and the ility to manage activities and supervise person-
nel. 1 believe that his demonstrated ability in this posi-
tion and his sustained record of job performance at an above- .
average level since his’ last promotion clearly merit his
promotier to GS-i4 at- this time. :

MEMOPARDUM FOR: Chief, ar /su

SUBIOCT t Promotion Request,
Leo H. WIOREN

1. It 19 requested that Mr. Yigren bo promoted to Ge-1j.

2. Mr. Wigren received his BA fron Yale in 1947, mjoring in
ietery ar] fusalan dangunge ami area studies, and his MA fran Harvard
An 1948 in history.“ He came on duty with the Soviet Intelligmece
‘Brozch of: vhat wes than Staff C io March 1951, ond stayed with that
branch as @ rescorch analyst on Coviet Intelligence until ofter its. |
tranefer. to uR/CE in early 1955, when ho tronoferred to WE Division

“qn search of a field assigmont. cuch assignment having becoze

increasingly doubtful by 1957, he transferred to ¥I/D where he re-

. mained until assignmnt to thia Division in April 1959 as Chier of

6R/cE/Research.

: 3. YF might as well admit at the ctart that X havo kncwn Br.
Wigren since ve wero in high echool together ani I have always tean
impressed with bia ability, particularly in the research flela.
Additionally, ke bas been in or cloes to research on Soviet Iutelli-
gence for the past O}.years. this, cosvined with his acadents
beckground in research msthodology, history in general and Russian
hiotery in particular, made hin my nutural choice for his presext
job although I had rover vorked directly with him before. In the .
past five months, I have had reason to de happy about uy choices. -
The main tecd in BR/CE/Resaerch hes been for an established program
of studios which wa might expect to be proluced in regular order;
thié bie been a necd, to my porsomil imowledge, oince 1955. Hr.
Wigren has quietly set up such a echedule with realietic target dates,

“da in touch vith ench study at cach joiut during ita productiaa, and

shows every indication of mecting his deadlines. Ao has a long-rengo
interect in counter-intolligence, knows what be 4u doing amd wry, ond

- 48 able to orient bla subordinates groperly and direct their efforts.

‘5. Although Mr. itigren has been in grode only 9 relatively abort
time, since April 1958, I feel that he ie doing a difficult joo
excollontly and that his promotion is justified on the basis of
academic backwrounmd, Agency experience and current performance,

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
I endorse the rating officer's coments on Mr. Wigren's performance. One of the
things that has impressed me most during my nine months as Chief of the Counter-
intelligence Staff has been the impact of the publications program on the intel-
ligence commmnity at large. In the CY field, there is nothing in the U.S.
Covernment comparable to it. With the current intensification. of interest in
counterintelligence, it affords the Agency a means of speaking to a wide audience ©
on issues and problems of abiding concern. Mr. Wigreit has done excellent work in
drawing upon the resources of the Staft_to-cotlect and then to, present counterintel-
ligence materials in a_way-calculatéd to serve their purpose admirably. 1 have

Mr. Wigren received a well-deserved prometion during this reporting period and
Lo moved in August to become the Staff Publications Officer. He mide solid progress in
ee the carly part of the reporting period, in makings the transition from the narrow
‘sphere he occupied in the previous Staff organization to the much more vy ried and
challenging duties of the External Branch. By the time he left that position he
had mastered its peculiar problems and proven his capability to muige its unusual
personnel effectively and productively. He has retained responsibility for cxploita-
tion of the most useful asset in that. branch and recently conducted the asset ona
.series of liaison visits which has resulted in a significant advance of our CI rela-
“tions with the services concerned. ee

ile has moved vigorously into the function of Publications Officer, which is one
of the most important activities in the Staff. He was selected for this assignment
because of his decp CI experience, writing ability, and his mature judgment in
selecting and preparing CI information appropriate to various audiences. Cost-
effective influences which he faces by participation ih- local government are also
applied in his Agency work, He deals confidently with senior officers. of the Staff
and other components and gets the best effort-out of his. subordinates. lis present
assignment is tailor-made for him, and he exhibits no’ significant weakness in per-
forming it. . . : . oe .

has accepted the assignment of running a new branch which iS an amalgamation of

L endorse Mr. Hood's Section D evaluation. I have found Mr. Wigren to be a.
wary dependable and resourceful individual .in undertaking the extensive research
coamitments that the staff has undertaken in meeting very heavy obligations of
gensttive liaison exchanges over the past year. Yr. Wigren is above all a gentle-
mar in his attitude toward and treatment of others. I would say in the long run
Rats, works to his disadvantage because his contribution and his modesty tend to
‘se overridden by the pretentions and bluster of others. Mr. Wigren has what has
maw; become a most precious commodity to the 050 in counterintelligence and that is

a@ grasp on many of the aspects of the collegial memory. He is therefore in a

In the past six. months the compartmonted nature of Mr. Wigren's “work
has brought him more directly into ‘the DC/CIOPS' cognizance rather than the
Chief of the R&A component as has previously been the case.-

I think Mr. Wigren's strengths and weaknesses have bean winnowell
‘thoroughly-in previous reporting. He is a recognized expert in his topic and as
such he: ‘Tépresents a considerable capital investment by the Agency in that kind

side the Agency, I have found his work to be extremely satisfactory and nore”

_ particularly, itis if he is given the time and specifications which are tharedfents
of his rneticulous and.thoroughgoing approach to hia work, Mr, Wigren could:

As was noted in the preceding fitness report, Mr. Wigren has a solid and
-broad knowledge of the USSR: its history, government, and intelligence services.
He also has a useful working knowledge of Russian, Consequently he serves in
GCL/RGA as senior referent on the RIS, against which target most of the Rroup's

work is directed, as

‘A key responsibility in R&A is to serve/the Staff'y repository and memory
for essential clements of information about the RIS. Mr. Wigren has organized
this abundance of material effectively, has ensured its retricvability, and con-

tinucs to update it,

Mr. Wigren consistently shows sound and dispassionate judgment, He does
not jump to conclusions but digs out the pertinent facts and brings them into
proper focus, He is skeptical without being negative. He accepts tasks and

' responsibilities without quibbling, and he carrics out these assignments suc-
cessfully without needing further consultation or guidance, °

He'is a quict person who keeps a low profile; but whén a significant issue

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

1, : Mr. Wigren is extremely proficient in handling nis section from doth the’
ie personnel and managerial standpoints. In addition, he {5 an expert on Soviet

Intellivence in his own right and lectures on the tezic to officials of this
and other governments. He ia particularly capable at training new researchers.

In reviewing his file today, I note that the Reviewing Official for his

““ fitness report of a year ago noted his opinion that my ratings of Mr. Wigren at
that time were too high. That opinion was not discuazed with me or with
Mr. Wigren. Perhaps the ratings were imieed too high, tut I must say that
considering the Fitness Report form and criteria in use at that time and nis
performance {n relation to that of other’ officers tr this branch and outside 4
I would give him the sam ratings today for that perilod.

i

The ratings in this current report will appear 2lightly lower than thoze
of the last report. This is not entirely due to tre different report form.
Mr. Wigren'o problems increased in both intensity and complexity during this -. . :
. period, ani I dd,not feel that he met the increased curien with as much of ar : *
! increase in performance as was necessary. This shoul not at all detract. fron
: my rating of his overall performance, which ie still exceptional and only
altghtly less than outstanding.

given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best Sosis for determining

Suture personnel o

Mr. Wigren has excellent substantive background on the Sovict Union and,
except for a two year period on'a WE operations desk, has devoted his entire
9 years in the Agency to research on Soviet Intelligence in one way or another,

His performance for the past year ina job formerly held by GS-14's and 15's

can only be described as superlor.. He has not only assumed responsibilities
greater than those of the previous incumbents; he has carried these out with
a-minimum of support and ina calm, mature manner which has earned. _
respect on all sides. Although his analysts have often been relatively .
inexperienced, he has geared their assignments to their capabilities and :
Subjects designed to increase their competence. His most important contri-

bution during this period has been in the formation of an organized plan of

research in. response to Agency and external requirements, and the establish-
ment of improved records and procedures to carry out this program,

Although Mr. Wigren: would prefer eventual assignment to the field as an
Operational officer, it seems to me his Sreatest potential lies in the kind of
research and support of operations. he is presently performing.. [ would therefore
recomniend that future training be oriented along these lines rather than Strictly
operational lines, and that planning for his eventual field assignment should
empha§ize his knowledge of Soviet Intelligence and his ability to deal with
Gther specialists in a "liaison" relation,

2. For the Reviewing Offictal- (continued). :

Mr. Wigren has also asked that it bo made a matter of record that, for
a period of three montha 1n.1956, ho wao acting chief of the Swedioh Doak
and handled these responaibilities effectively. IT have agreed to cite tho
extent of his responsibilities. Cortainly the, routing business of the
dosk was kept moving. during this perlod. I have pointod out with respect ;
to the maaier-of his performance of hia duties that his fituess report Le not
an unfavorable ono. The factors which have turned this annual fitnesa
roport into a porsonal crisis for him‘are tho simultaneous deferment of

- his hoped-for promotion, and the deferment of an ovorsens assignment for

him -- both.of which actions naturally reflect on his past performances
IT have pointed out that we have to requiro aprruciably better than
average performancen from officera we send overseas, that I bolieve we
have in ths Branch at least one bettor qualified candidate for tho
overgeas nsoignaent in question, and that I am obliged to give the
assignment to the porson-I fool is best qualified.

Porhaps understandably, Mr. Wigren continues to bolieve that this —
report ta not a fair reflection of hia performance. I have told him
that Ican go no further in attompting to oxplain my judgement and have
asked that he disouas his situation with the Deputy Division Chief
and/or the Division Chief. He agreed to do Ao.
