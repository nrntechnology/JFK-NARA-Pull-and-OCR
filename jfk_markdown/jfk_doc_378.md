activities subsequent to his infiltration tn PEHUMEN, and his
‘contacts with Chelin, the brother of AMFRET-7. AMFRET=7's arrest
‘was reported in Reference B, The AMFRET-7 Cage Officer states
that both AMFRET-7 and his brother were arrested, after shooting *£4- Ff.
it out with G-2 and being wounded. Olas acted tn Reference D, veh ety
AMFRET-7's arrest was mado after [QUANTUN-55]and Blanca FeMARTINEZ oor} -
de Hoya, aka "Cuca," aka "Cuchi, brought MEDINA, AMSPELL’s National— |

his S/W Message 11 of 10 December 1962 that “his friends" are still
in jail, . :

6. Reference E transmitted a ictter written by AMHINT-33

on 29 December 1962 in which he states that G-2 infiltration is so

great that he considers it impossible to organize anything, am he
indicates that some of the agents, as in this case, have been infil-
trated for more than two years, He presumably means infiltrated \
into anti-CASTRO organizations and/or activities.

- ates 7. Relative to the “other groups" mentioned in para. 1
above, ANHINT-33's Case Officer belteves that AMHINT-33 is probably
“es preferring to the MRR, the MRP, the MDC and the 30th of November «.?

8. JMWAVE traces on the individua ts involved in this plot— -- -
offer little concrete information.

' “a. It is noted that Jorge MEDINA ‘Bringuier is listed
on Page 13 of Attachment C to UFGA-1977 as an MRR member, with a
listed aka of Carlos PRADO. JNWAVE tracing identifies one Carlos
PRADO as “a brother of Raul, the head of G-2 in Las Villas Province,” ]-
as-reported in HAVA-6437, 5’ October 1960; there is no further informa
tion on this Carlos PRADO. However, the original source of the inform
ation given in Attachment C of UFGA-1977 was a letter brought out .
of PBRUMEN by AMSTRUT=-1 about early July 1962. Said letter contained
a $25 money order, issued at Station No. 9, New Orleans, on
16 March 1962, for Jorge MEDINA. Bringuicr and purchased by Maria
Teresa MEDINA, The envelope, addressed to Sra. Consuelo.C. de
RIVAS in Nexico City, bore the notation, “For Carlos PRADO," and
contained a note, “This money order for $25 is for Carlos PRADO
from his mother,” in addition to the moncy order. There is one

' Carlos PRADQ in Mexico. He _is studying engineering and is. the BY . ae

brother of<fayating Privo fa arcia, an engineer who works close to i we
“Che GUEVA and 4s of currgnt KUTUBE interest 7 Faustino PRADO jj, :
is married to Clara ARTIME, A sister of Josefina “ARTIME, who is |} s
a close friend of AMGLEN-9,, and she is atso of current; KUTUBE interest
When AMSTRUT-2, who could have given this letter to AMSTRUT-1 to (|;
take out of PBRUMEN, was in Mexico City she called Caflos. PRADO by ©
telephone at 249769 and told him that she was.a frien@ of his mother.
This PRADO family is a large one, and includes anothe, brother, \

Angel, who is in Spain,’ a sister who is a nun in Ita¥y, and another
brother who is a doctgr in New York City. Additiona} data could

be secured on this ryny from AMSTRUT-2 if desired.{ However, it
seems probable that Chis money order may have been shad in Cuba -
by Jorge MEDIKA and ‘purchased, sooner or later, by th e mother of the
Carlos PRADO who ig currently a student in Mexico. copy of the
material carried ont by ANSTRUT-1 is being forwarded] herewith. It

c. It is noted that Reference F identifies Jorge
HAEDO as 4 former anti-Castrista who was tortured and doubled by.

“the PBRUMEN Government; HAEDO" appears to be tho correct spelling.

d. "Cuca" or "Cuchi" MARTINEZ, who has held the position
of AMSPELL National Coordinator for Civil Resistance, is a personal

8 December 1962 and received 12 December, reported that ]QUANTUM-
advised "Cuca". to hide or be cauttous because MEDINA had“ turned of
to be a G-2 ‘member. The message said that this was learned from
AMSPELL prisoners and that, during interrogation, they were asked
many questions about "Cuca" and ANCOG~-2.
