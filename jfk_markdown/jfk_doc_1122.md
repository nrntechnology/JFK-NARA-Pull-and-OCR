the Cuba Project, dated 15 January 1962, assigns 32 specific tasks
to elements of the U.S. Government. Of these, 16 are assigned
to CIA solely or jointly. The tasks have been reviewed by this
Agency, and it has been determined that substantially all reporting -
and planning deadlines can be met. Work on all tasks, with and
without assigned dates for completion, is in progress. The
following detailed observations are keyed to General Lansdale's
paper.

points will be determined.

4. Task 4, p.5. An operational assessment of the stay~
behind net in Cuba will be completed and reported by the deadline
of 15 February. Because communication with singleton agents is
by sw, not w/T. itis unlikely that assessment can be completed
by the date stipulated; an extension to 28 February may be
necessary, altho every effort is being made to complete the work

befere that dat An intensive program aimed at the acquisition

of third countrassets through the cooperation of diaison-se: iges rh

is also.under way, particularly in Spain. Belgium.

A progress report on the status of
this program will be alideé’ by 15 February, although this Agency
cannot be sure that the cooperation of all intended participants will
have been obtained by that date. CIA has also taken the follow-
ing additional steps in respect to Task 4.

will necessarily be based upon an appeal made inside the island by

intermediaries selected from the ranks offjournalists, foreign
officials, international businessmen, foreign lawyers, crime
syndicates, international detectives and foreign police officials.
Additiomally, plans for the defection of lower-level Cuban officials
