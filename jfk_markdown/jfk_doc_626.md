ACTION FLOURED MLEEREMCES,

See paragraph 3

1. A source who has given highly reliable information in the past, and
whom ve bave no reason to question, has stated that during 1943 one Luis
TEDESCHI was either being considered for recruitment by/or was actually work-
ing for the RIS. According to the source, he was known to have been active
as a member of the Bpanish Commmist Party. The address used by TEDESCHI
during early 1943 was Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

2. The Buénos.Aires Station hre determined that a Luis TEDESCHI, born
2 February 1918, is listed in local police files aa living at El Doredor 3150,
telephone 58-3717. Further investigation is being corducted there. Unfortu-
nately, Headquarters does not have the date and place of birth of Bubject of
paragraph 1. The source has indicated that Subject was probably born in Italy
and may have been active in the Spanish Civil War 1936-39. This » of course,
could explain his involvement in the Spanien Commnist Party.

3. It ig requested that Rome, Barcelona, end Madicid check Station and
<Base‘ files for any traces of Subject.-- Liaison and police contacts may be -
approached for any informtion available in their files.

1. Headquartera regrets that it has been unable to learn the date and place
of birth of the Luis TEDISCHI who, according tu a usually reliable source, was being
considered tor recruitment tn 193 by the RIS, or was actually working for the FIS,
4s stated in HAM#=6515, our ‘source reported that the address used by TEDESCHI during
the early part of 1943 was Pichincha 969, Suenos Alres.

2. Collateral information on Luis TLD<SCHT of Pichincha 969, Buenos Aires,
has been found in a 192 document which ancears to have been based on censorship
reports. This document indicates that TELcSCul's address, as given above, was a
cover address for a VDE (Union Democratica sspanola) nanifesto sent from Cuba.
Also one THLESCHI, Estados Unido 4366, Buenos Aires, was given as a cover address

in a secret writing message. A copy of the pertinent portions of this document
is attached.

3. It is hoped that a unilateral surveillance on the Luis TELEDCHI Living at
Bl Domador 3150, Buenos Aires, if instituted as the station Planned, will be
fruitful. Headquarters will be extremely interested in any further information on
this individual you may be able to Cevelop, as it is possible that he may be linked
with Communist and/or KIS activities in Cuba as well as being used locally by the RIS.

. he &s.KUDESK 18 currently handling this case, it is requested that the slug
PEDKOOD not be used.

1. In view! of the fact that Subject dispatch presented a

possible lead to an RIS agent, it was decided to do a unilateral

check on TSDADCEI rather than refer the matter to liaison. As a

the syndicates ia "artificial": ev r:one hates then. The ;:e0,le belong to the

threatened with being expelied they say tnat is what they are waiting for, for

the Palange to play at "fisticuffs*®. There are many officers in the arny wo

The cost violent op ositio:: comes from queipo de Llano and Yarue. No one knows
where Queipo is coing and Yavue ‘s thcught to be in exile in the Prov. of Pontevedra,
Both were cashiered, queipo for protesting against food leaving for Germany and
Yague -oecause in a speech at Zarazoza, he said —- "we do desire a great and

great courage.

HELP 7 THE NAZIS. — He says that his opinion is that a great deal of food is

up for want of then.

TH2 CHURCH. — He says that it is not true that in the Church there are anti=
German and Anti~Falanzist sroups. The supporters’ of the Re-ime are the Falange,
the Germans and-t.e Clergy, in that order, The Church wishes for the triumph

MARTA RODRIGUEZ, about 28 years cld, Comes froa a confortably-off peasant
family in the Province »f Orense., Sheis very sluggish and at evary question
rezeats that she dows not know and that women do not understand many thin 66
She had only a little nure than an hour to avare as she was busy in the evening
and had to leave for ths interior in the morning.

aR — She says t!.at she was surprised when she arrived in Havana as she thinks
there is nore enthusiasa in S$: ain than here ani acre confidence in an American
victory. The peasants “like ev-ryone else" would like the “Anerican® to win,

even ti.ose cn the Right are sure the jermans will lose. Sha cannot explain the
nature of Franco's assistance to Hitler, ehe says only tuat "as it was the

Germans wro won, Spain owes them nore tnan it has*®. Shs cannot te sxplicit,
either,about the dangere of war, but shé says that Franco's swldiors, the young
men in zeneral,and as a cuncrete instance a wathar of hers wi. servei five youme
in Franco's gry, sayQtrat they mil go up into the acuntain and shoot befcre

golnz again t+ the war. Adout tne Division Azul sha knows on. that when it

was first formed a volunteer left from her district. He was a outlaw who -
hed committed crimes and she says t:at he went through fear of the consequences.
The people do not like the alue Division. Tney were aot aske! scr anything for the
®yoluntderst.

FUTURE PROSPECTS — She insiats that there is great confidence that it will soon
Change. So much so that a Republican who was lidden for years and afterwards

discovered told her to tell her husband "Do rot leave beacuse things will soon change®

The villaze Las a hundred inhabitants, and she says that they all hope it will
change; but fron what we cm gather thie confidence is based entirely on an
Allied victory. She aays that if tne English upened a second front in Spain the
peozle would revolt, but she says che t.as heard no o;inions on this point. The
peo:le speak without fear, She relates that the Falangists tried to take a
‘pistol from har. father and that he hid it. They threatened hia, they took him in
-@ car telling xkumctexdaxmk him that they ware yoing to knock his head off,
but the old manr emained firm, telling them to do what they Jiked. They did not
do anything to him nor dia they gst the pistci. As an example cf solidarity
against the Falange the old man said he Lad sold the pistgl to a man who was
going to america. They told him to prove it, the oldbrought as witnesses two
peasants who lived more than a leacus away, without having agreed on a story
first, but being quite convinced ti.at the veasants when they saw the Falangista,
if only for the saxe of contradicting them, wuld say that what he said was true.
& little later they sent nima notices for a Falanzist meeting and he refused to
go. She does nd know if tne other peasants did.

ARMY — She knows t. at a short time ago they digs:issed tne 56 (1956) Draft.
Her husbami was on service in Orense and deserted and went to Cuba. Immediately
the Captain of the Company and a lieutenant went to him house to make inquiries.
His.brother told them "In his circumstances I do aot ‘mow what I would have
done®, and the captain and the lieutenant went away saying - "He is right".

PEASANTS. — AS wo have already said, she belongs to a fanily which is om
fortably off, they have several labourers in their employ. She says that the dw
la bourers, and the farmer are ecually gainat the Gevermment and the Germans,

To illustrate tne situation she says that the daily wage is 20 pts. without

food, .and_8-with-food.—They-eld-prefer-the 5 and food, because otherwise they
have nothing to eat. The peasants are very discontented, and show it openly

THE DIVISION AZVL was a Falangist manoeuvre to give political icportance to some =
Palangist leaders. The manoeuvre turned out very badly. Tris Division is the -
most unpopular innovation of the Falange. Our informant talked with 11 sur-
vivors of the division, who had returned from the Russian front cn account of
their wounds, ne of thom was 18 when he left as a voluntesr, without the
consent of his family. He asked if he would return to the front again and ho
answered categorically *ky eyos hava been opened. I will rever return®,

They all speak of the bad food they are given ~ mainly vitamin pilis and pots

of jam, They speak of the courage and fighting spirit cf ths Russian arzy, tut
above all of the contempt with which the Ogrmans treated thea. Thay regarded
them as inforior beings and they alao said that when they -aid complimsnts to
the German women, a Spanish custom, they answered them disdainfully as if they
despised them, There were cases of solf-cutilation in the raixs of tie Blue
Division, At any rate their panic was obvious, amt they refused to return.
Everybody speake ill of the Division Azul.

emong them Varela, Armda, Yague, Queipo etc. Asong the soldiers the feeling
against the Pascist Regime ie very marked. They complain of bad food,
treatment, clothes.... too much time spent on marches etc, Queipo, on his
returnfron Ifaly was rude to Serrano Suner and struck him for which he was seat
back to Italy. Gsncral sranda gpent a aonth at Gijon and talked to our informant,
Thay had on interview. our informant has a real admiration for Aranda, wi.o, he
says, is a gentleman. He says that sfands ap:eared to be Igftist. azcng his .

we have been for some time. If you walk through the Castellana of Madrid you
will-eee the suzptuous palaces owned by Hesler(7) ani Pramo de Rivera, etc. built wi
with the blood of the Cuban people and the poor Spaniards who went to defend
the Spanish colomies, The colonitm esre lost but the military leaders, whose duty
it was todfend thea, enriched themselves. How it is the same thing over again.
Fo made a revolution in order to bring progress to Spain but we have spilt
blood in torrents uselessly. The result was not worth the expense of so much
blood end so muchmpregsion®, . .
Ta his conversation, although he said nothing against the Ggrmans, he showed
contexpt for the Falangists who are enriching themelves; he sheced particular
foar of the treataent meted out to the soldiers in barracks, Hla impression
is that it was a result of the seriousness of the situation through whieh the
Framquist regine was passing and fear of what the outcome might be. He said
nothing about the state of the war, and whether he was a partisan of England.
th the conversation he. had with the General Lt is possible that there was another
~ aspect, which through discretion he did not repeat. ; .

SITUATION OF THs PRISONERS, —— Ha cannot calculate the number of prisoners there
are actually at the moment although be asserts that it is at any. rate enormous.
Ey reason of his position he has vis ted prisons and fortresses, and is terrified
at the terrible treatment in the "Comisarias® Civil Guard barracks eto. Gm

more than cne occasion he says he haa saved moro than one Republican fromo rtain
death, The prison that he knuws is the Coto at Gijon. I¢ is at tho moment
completaly full. The treatment is inhuman. Thay do not give the prisoners

a call number but allocate them only a equare meter for slesping, atanding sto.
That 1s to say that when a prigoner arrives he ie given a metre of ground. Nor
do they give them a mess. Lately they agreed to give them a peseta daly for
maintenance. Es does not understand why there are not acre deaths, as with

one peseta a day in the prieon canteen ons can only buy bread. They fook tho
hiiners who were prisoners to camps so that theymuld wrk in the mines. They
gave thea 504m, day wages for bachelors and a peseta for a aife ami 50 cts.

for each child, to the married ones. They keep them working ten and twelve hours
égily in.the mine. The nuaber of shootings has diminished, If ia imputed to the

THE CLERGY —. Ho eayo that the clergy have never intervened in poditics fron the
° pulpit as auch as they do now, sometimes inveighing against the Franquist
‘Gevernnent, and et other tines, naturally, defending the policy of the Falange.
Rumbers of the priests and nonks continually ex:ound their view on the political
regina and the points on which they differ froa it. As a characteristic example
he relates that about two months ago in Gijon there was a house used provisionally
as the Church of. San Jose, which was destroyed during the War. A priest, —
“pfofessor at Salananca, gave fivo lectures. In these lectures he spoke almost
exclusively on political questions, and attacked the Franquist Government -
for their method of suprly and distributing tie foodstuffs among the peple, .
saying thet what was wanted was rore rationing and less Frmaquist reguistions. —
He also advocated the necessity of a pardon for all comiemned people and other .
things that our informant does not remember. 500 peorle went to the first lecture,
but tm the second one, when they heard what the subject was, was attended by -

PACTS ABOUT PEST STANCE. - _- In Spain acto ‘of sabotage: are carried out on the raile’
" ways, factories, etc., although he cannot decide whether these are organised. --

actions decreed py illegal organisations of Spanish Republicans or amepot=

taneous acts of workers who are onemies-of the Palangist regime. Be does nob og

know any concrete instance cf thse activity of the workers orgarisations, C.P.3. Lok

ote., but when he was in Madrid on the 22nd: and 23rd of last June; there was . -

a film on called "We Thieves are Honest Men®, Thare were thousands of Lampoona Fi

dond on that, some very clever and suggestive which were scattered throughout so a

Madrid. According to our informant, one day the lampoons appeared printed in , : 2

the same typo lettering as tie roaster, with the following - Swords of the Candilio, : 4

from a recent speech*®. For t:is reason there wore arrests and a number of . mo, 4

beatings in Madrid. He also saw how the people had lost their fear. In . i

the Oran Wa in Madrid a man cried out that he was not only red but conmunist, t

and he muld not endure this any nore. Apparently the people told him to be

silent put he did not take any notice. The R.A.F, bombardment of Colognes,

which was known in Spain fro the English bpeadcaste, was calebrated alnost all

over Spain by the people who stayed up much later than the usual time in the

etreeta, drinxing in bare, otc. Be says that oven the police took part as

thoy are largely Anglophile.

GUERILLEROS — He says that there are many in Asturias; there is a state

of war. There are Moore and the'Tercio!. Ths guerilieros appear occasiondly
in the villages and avenge the deaths of antieWescists who have been murdered
by the Falange. They take food and clothes. Once his car was stopped by a
group of them in the street of Llanes. They wsre drossed as Falangists.

Fhen he showed his papers as Consul of Cuba and proved ho was not the previous
consul Pena, a known Falangist, they saluted him and said = “Long live the
people of Cuba®, He says that although they behaved sorreotly he was rather
afraid. He knows that a short time ago the guerilleres of Campocaso had Tight
with the Civil Guard and killed several people, among thet some well known lane
giste in the district. It appears that the Querilleros are magnificently armed,

FUTURE PROSPECTS, —- He believes firmly that Hitler will be defeated this yoars
Me has great faith in the people of Spain and France, oto. Hasiadominated
Burope will sriss, since this life cannot continues “even one winter more’,
He is confident tiat the U.$.5.R, will not ba defeateds on the contrary the
Soviet battlefronts will be the end of Hitlerism. Hs believes that England

. and the U.S,, in opening a secon front, will count on the help of peoples
Zergocet by the Hasis, in France or in Spain, ond things will move rapidly.

The Spanish people ure waiting for the invation of the Allies in order te take
‘erm in the streets ageinst their rulers. The Spaniards trust in the Allies
and hope that the Second Front will not be long delayed. Soviet and English
broadcaste. arolictened to; they fcllow the progress of tie war. They hate the
Germans ani the Italians. These who before supported Franco ara now his
enemies and partisans of the defeat of Hitler. Tho Spanish people hope to
escape from this situation by the defeat of Hitler ani trust ih the Restoration
of the Republic.

no one bothers about politics at all now, and only Gout food. There are all

Spaniards would unite to defend themselves from the English. Theywuld do the
same if the Osrmans invaded Spain,

ON THE WAR.— He eaid that the Sranish idea was that it would last five or
eiz years ani that whon they were all exhausted there would be an armistice

or negotiated peace. This is tie oyinion of the people on the Right and the

‘sell at the standard rate they leave the peasants enough to eat. It ia obvious
that’ everyone makes fun cf the order and hides the produce "but it le not that

the prisoners. Queipo refused to allow the uevuene to have any olive oil.

The situation of the soldiers is very bad. ey hardly eat at all, and are

very badly clothed. It is pitiful to eee thes. They all wish to be de~
mobilised as aoon as possible. The '59 draft has been denobilised and he

thinks the first reserve of the '40 draft as well. He thinks it 1s because

they cannot kesp them in barracks for want of foods

THE POOPLE'S RESISTANTZ TO THS WAR AND THE REQIER — According to our infore
mant the atate of mind of the people is one of extreme hostility towards the
present state of affairs, although it 18 sot obviously shown. The Reds

are in hifiing, He says that the only people who are openly fighting -against
the Falange and the Regime in power are the Rgquetes. That besides the
pamphlets we have referred to above, there often appear on the walls, lampoons
and postere against the Palange. He rememters one which said sore or lese -
"Famine and Theft, that 1s the Falange", ‘There appeared another very like it, but
he does not know what it said because they rubbed it out at once. He says
the Requetes also accused the Falanghets of being cowardly assassins who are
‘only useful for doing mass assassinations (#dar Paseos*).— .

The. people take a sympathetic view of thess actions of the Requetes. bs)
the queues people txkmooagex speak against the Covernment and the Falange.
There are nany prisoners, When the ‘nationalists® first entered Santander they
killed pecple in thousands. The Palangists held many “passos®. They went on
killing, only less than at first. The prisoners died of their harsh treatment,
many were tubercular. He doea rot inow if they clive them organised assistance.
Probably relaticna and friends. He does not <now of any activity of the party,
or the J.S.U. The Reds are very carefully watched. The only ones who do_
anything are the Requetes. In general cur informant does net know any of ow

organisations because he was very young when the war began. The only thing he says ~

ie “the Falangists are like those they used to call the F.A.I. They co toa |

‘house, steal, take a man, take him and shoot him, and then it is finished®.

‘We cculd not get my information about the Union Nacional, althoush he gives the
impression that he does not xnow anything about it. - .

He has no ideas .n the futurg prospects... He thinks that thte depends on
Englands there ia talk that the pea eke® wish to set up a King who ta not a
Bourbon. He does nct -ncw anythi @ restoration of Don Juan. The Falangists
sre enemies of the Mpnarchy and the people do not worry much about thie
problem, Referring to the attack on 8, Suner; Espinosa: de los Monteros,
Ambassador in Berlin, had on one of his visits to Madrid, a violent quarrel
with Suner and in consequence resigned. He reports that then he was aprointed
Captain General of the Sixth Region, Burgos, and on takbag over the poat he made
& speech in which he attacked the Falange. He reports that as a consequence be
was violently dismissed. A few days later a eon: of the general whois a

A young Basque 24 cr 25 years old. By profession a metaleworker. Up to ~..
the beginning of the war he. was working with an-uncle in Zaragoza. Es remained.
in the battle sone throughout the whole: war and was mobilised in Franco te army,

Is a Basque nationalist, like almost all’ Ms family. Although a workman’ by
profession he always worked with his relating, slmoat alvaye as_fcreman, or

at least as manager. He has no political point of view nor are his class
foelings very developed. He has never belonged to any symileate. After the

War was over he worked in Bilbm ina wire factory wheres there were about

&@ thousand workmen. He final'y left work in order to devote himself to the

Black Market because, acording: to hin, it was impossible to live on what he

only ones with which he was con-ected. For this reason his report ia rather
incomplete, and in soce cases lacks objectivity. He is rather reserved,

ATTITUDE OF THB SPANIARDS TOWARDS THE ANTI-HITLER WAR, — In the graphic
words of the informant, 90% of Spaniards are partisans of England. _ The
workers, peasants, potit-dourgeois, capitalists, and some of the clergy,
(later he told us the majority of tha Basque cures) are cn the side England,
although in a passive way, and against Germany and the Palange.

The general opinion which ie expressed in ecnvsrsations between groups of
friends, and lately also in the street, is that the defeat of Germany is ine
evitable, due, ascording to our informant, to the fact that the’Allies have
more econoric resources end more prinsry materials. It is thought that the
United States will be a very important factor in theredisation of victory.

Also the defeats cuffered by Germany on the Eastern front contribute to
streacing this opinion.

In Spain everyone is tired of the war, and no one wishes Spain to take part
in it. There people are in a real panic on this acore. Or informant thinks
that if Franco should decide to ficht, in view the terrorist nature of ths
Regine, the people would have to obey. Later in another conversation he said that
there were peonle who, in that case, would hide in the mountains,

-The defeats suffered by Qgrmany on the Rastern front were well krom
there and contributed to increase the people's confidence. He says that they
said there that, in spite of their resistance, it was obvious that the Russians
were not suffi ciently prepared to face a power like Germany.

The entry of the United States into the war was received with ‘oy by the
people who interpreted it ss an event destined to shorten the war, of which they
are all very tired over there.

The Ratification of the Anglo-Russian Pact and the dnerican-Rusaian agreemnt
4s known there, althcugh the range and content of the pact and the agresméint
were not mow. He says that the Falangist prese; only said that these nstions
hed prosised not to make a separate peace.

He does not know t.e agreement about the second frmt, although this ~ :
subject is very often. spoken of, with the idea that it would be the final blow to
Germany. Over there they think that the. opening of the Sgcond Front will result
in the rising of the French people, perhaps the Spanish people too, With tis ides
in mind the people often dizcuss possible landing places. It is thought that

SUPPORT OLVEN SY TH FRAMY' TST REOTMS AID THE PALANGZ TO) PITLER. — Our
Anformant doea nut know in whatq wntity they send reinforcements to the Biue
Division. He thimks that there is soze exa:-eraticn on this nvint on the prt .
of the Falangist Preas wrth tries in this way to encourage enthusiasm arong the
young men. He knows that the place they report to and tra‘h is San Sebastian,
amd that from there they leave for thefrcent. He thinks that they are still
sending people, but they are only "reliefs® for those who come h:me. Ha adds
that those wlo yo to the Division aul today,with very few exceptions, do it
against their will, ‘They get the majerity of those who go from the barracks.
He says that many workmen went to Germany on acoount of the lack of food and
work. He dose nst know how many but he thinks a fair wuantity. He says that the
people take those things calmly generally, because they cannot do anythhz
against them. He only heard that in Ipim there had been sone scene with the
Blue Diviebn or with the-workers who wore going to Germany but he zives noe
actual details, saying that it is dangerous t. try and Imow too much,

In Spain the Bost fervent supporters of tha Maxis are - Suner, kunos crane,
Moscardo and other generals, and especially the "idealist® Falanciste, or those
who custitted injustices or profiteered and are afraid of "the table being
turneds, . .

‘Be saye that the Falange is only the stadcw of what it was during the
war. That at the begin-ing sany people fo.ned it for safety's sake, out now
it is“dead thing that no one takes any notice of. The same happened with the
“Flechas", "Frente de la Juventud! ete. The syndicates have many members,
because membership is obligatory in order to get work. The workers would not
Join them if they could help it. He says that all the directors are Falanist
bureaucrats who take aivantage of their position to steal all they can. He
Cltes-as-anexasple the fact that emloyers are obliged to pay sometrinz as
a contribution to the subsidy allocated to workuen with large femilies,.ut he
says that the Folangists do not pay it to anybody, but spend it themselves.
For these and other aitilar reasons there is a lot of discontent among tte
e@nployars, : 7

Our informant says tmt they are still sending large quantities of food
to Germany, also iron and othyr materials, The peonle know that if there is
‘fanifie in Spain it is becaus@/the Germans and the "Black Marketeers®

Aaked bbout the production of the metal factories in Bilbao, he says that

He knows that pig-iron is being sent to France, he imagines it is intended |
‘for Germany. ron ore is also sent to France dy SOBs :

FRICTION AMONG THE RULING CLASSES. —- He knows that in the aruy there 4s a surge |
‘eeling against the Falange, but he says that it has‘nic outéide repempussions.
The-only-incident-kmown there was’ the case of Yague and Queipo de Lian y

Be says tat even those wio belonged to the Falange before, young students, -
employcea or just rich peo-le, do not wish to have. anything w. ‘do with it |
now, and say that the Palanze is going to the dogs. ~ .

Be adda that in general everybody hopes that the triumph of England will
cause a change of government in Spain and so they confine themselves to waiting
alth ugh there ie talk of a posible coup d'etat by the soldiers.

RESISTANCE CF TY -PRO- BAG) INST ENTERING qmar. iD 46 NST THE. :
REGIME -- The peoole wish to gse.the situation change as soon as peasible. but
they believe that the solution must come from outside. Accordizg to our infers:
mont, there is nc thought of fighting againstha. regine. We eays that the
workers in the factory in which he worked spoke openly against the regige but -

he does not know that there was any activity. (Given the character of the
infcrmant wo may aup os@ that even 1f there was he would take pains to icnore
it). From time to time the women ricted in the queues; at first they sit

them up, «ow they say nothing, He asserts that every day the people meak mre
openly against the régine., The contribution to SAuxilio Soctal® was obligatory ~
before but row no one pays. When the young ladieg of "Auxilio Social® beg for
subscriptions in the streets andi aek the reagon for refusal, sone people answer =
ecause I do not wian to*,

He says that when Franco was at Bilbao the peqle remained in their houses
end he was received only by four “chats bottes"® in the offices of the Falange,
At the end of Franco's gsech not a soul applaudel. Then some Faleneist
young ladies said, helf in tears, *what wo must do is buy a machine gun and
shoot them all®

Assistance to the priwners, according to our informant is given by relations

and friends. There is no organised assistance, but he proceeds to tell us that
certainl: thera have been collections sonctings in the factory inf avour of the
prisoners, but “by groups of friends®, He does not know of the activity of any
organisation, as such. ‘Tha nationaliate, according to him (he is a nationslist)
are tne ones mo have some organisation,
. They distributed there a speech made by Aguirre in America. (ne of she
Pristots was also in circ:lation. Ee has no news of the other organisations
although he adaits that if they have any organization they would not go and
tell him avout it.

When he ia asked about the activity of the different organi sati ons of which
the Frente Pooular is composed, and the attitude of the militant party members
of these organisations, he asserta categorically that there tne people are
completely united, and there is now no talk of socialists, anarchists, coasunista,
Tepublicans.eto. All treat each other as comrades, and help each other as far
as they can. In Spain, according to our igformant, there are only now enszies
of Franco and the Palange, tho maintain a strict unityY among themselves; thay
discuss the progress of the war together,cou: ent on the situation ets. Eg says
that the people wish for unity, regret the disumion there was before in Spain .
and the quarrals between different parties and anti-fascist organieations, ~~

Be did n-t knew of the shooting of Larra or Diegues, The execution of Larra .
impressed him very much and he said that 4 in order. to do what Lerra had done ons
would need plenty of gute.

FUTURE PROSPECTS — Se repeats again that they believe in Spain ‘that the-triumh
_ Of England will cause a change in the situation. (We cust. point out that for some
time there have been currente in the Basque nationali sa which have. been’ seeking.
for a Ssolution® of their national preblem with the assiatence of England, - .
