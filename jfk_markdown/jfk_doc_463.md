MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

‘SUBJECT: Luis Clements POSADA-Carriles

- REFERENCES: a. Memo for Record, 26 June 1967, by LRH,

samo subject
b. Williamson/Hense Telephone Conversation,
28 June 1967 .

1. In my meeting with the Department of Justice today, 1
confirmed that POSADA-Carriles was our man. I outlined the pre-
liminary information we had developed on the transactions between
him and one Lefty Rosenthal.

2. Justice was advised that our information disclosed that
POSADA-Carriles had paseed silencers and gre: to Rosenthal
during July 1965, and that in Cctober 1966 he had furnished pencils
and fuses. I also stated that it was our understanding that POSADA-
Carriles was in contact with FBI/Miami and that it had been advised
of these dealings. Justice-was told that the iteme involved were not
of Agency origin. It was emphasized, however, that this was our
preliminary conclusion and that we would undertake to verify it.

3. Justice acknowledged that FBI reporting disclosed
POSADA-Carriles as \ts contact but apparextly the details are some-
what vague. To make a federal case agaiast Roserthal because of his
suspected involvement in the bombings, it will be necessary to show
that the iteme used were obtained through interstate commerce. A
preliminary reading suggests prosecution under Title 18 Section 337.
Out of concern for the allegation of entrapment, Justice asked that

Vad wet wa ‘

14-0000

we supply answers to the following: (a) did POSADA-Carrlles

volunteer himself-to the FBI or did it spproach him initially;

who informed the FBI of the July 1965 deal - the Agency or

, “(c) on what date was this information given;
4a) ‘oimilorly as regards tho-October 1966 transaction, the dato

. . the information furnished and by whom; (e) what were POSADA-

- : .Cagriies soarees* ‘for the items or their components; (f) were -
: . 1 the. sources within or without the State of Florida? And inci- |

. 3 that supposedly POSADA-Carriles realized

ah at r furnishing the October 1966 items and that he tried

C : ° without success to turn it into the "company"? While I agreed to

i . - undertake to odtain the information requested, I euggestéed that \
a . much of it might be readily available from the FBI. Justice con-

‘ ” ceded this and intensa to have further discussions with it.

to : 4. Daring the course of the meeting the interesting

4 : hypothesis was suggested to the effect that POSADA-Carriles

: “ ">". might have been "moonlighting" for Rosenthal, and only when he

i began to feel the pressuré did he start reporting to the Agency and
| ’ the FBI.

| , 5. Under strictly controlled conditions with POSADA-
Carriles acting as a conduit, Justice is considering the possibility
of assisting Rosenthal to obtain his needed items, whereupon he
will be arrested immediately for possession. [ told them while we
might be willing to have POSADA-Carriles so used we were under-
etandably concerned over the adverse comment thai our employee's

involvement coald generate.

6. Opa matter that may be related: one Alhert LARRAIN
Maestro is alleged to have admitted to POSADA-Carriles that he haa
been involved im the bombings with Rosenthal and to have said more :
explosives were needed. LARRAIN Maestre is a fugitive under a ,

‘narcotics endictment having formerly resided at 153 East 57th Street, .
New York, New York. Do we have any information on this person?
