LIVER FUNCTION TEST .

On 24 October 1968, I saw Dr. Daly of the Bio-cheristry
Laboratory of “test London Hospital for liver function
tests. My fanily coctor, Dr. Eoces, sent me to Daly as

a private patient, as British practice is not to taxe these
tests unless the patient's condition seems to be worsening.
My doctor thousht I showed no signs of a recurrence of
hepatitis and the normal practice would nave been, aS most,
for me to nave deen exanined ty the specialist at the
hospital, who might then decicée to asx for the tests.

Daly said that all recuired tests, except the 3.S.?.,
would be done. He said he tnoucght the 3.S.>?. unnecessary
uriless the others indicated negative factors. In
case, he said he would ask me to come in again for
test.

that -

Daly will. send me the results of the tests and his bill
e/o American Express, Rome, within a week.

1. After considering several alternatives and given QRPHONE/1's
lack of financial forward planning, LCPIPIT believes that it would
be beneficial and advantageous for WOPIRM to offer to subsidize a
portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both
life insurance and a cash value toward retirement. We have dis-
cussed this with QRPHONE/] and he has agreed to the desirability of
such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement
and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.

We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals
which he has received from the local representative of a reputable
WOLADY insurance firm. .

2. _LCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the
cost of a life insurance program for QRPHONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion
not to exceed $50 per month.) Prom an administration standpoint

this would merely take the form of an increased monthly payment and
we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were
indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

1, On the basis of the documentation submitted ander reference dispatch, the
Medical Staff feels that ORPHONE/I made a surprisingly fast recovery and seems
well on the way to complete health. However, the hospital report (2 quick transla-
tlon of which into English is attached for your ready reference), dated as it is, still
reflects some inconclusive levels in the results of the various chemical tests shown,
Undoubtedly these have by now been lowered to completely safe levels, since
QRPHONE/1 apparently felt well enough to travel to France, but the Medical Staff
believes it would be advisable for CRPHONE/1 to undergo another series of liver
function tests, to include the following: :

a. SGOT
b. SGPT
c. Bilirubin (1) Direct
(2) Indirect
(3) Total
dad. B.S.P. (Bromsulfophthalein)
e. Serum Preteins
Albumin
Globulin
Total

We assume QRPHONE/?! has consulted his own physician on his return to the UK,
but the Medieal Staff has pointed out that clinical examination alone is not always
sufficient to determine complete recovery from hepatitis.

2. In terme of our operational atilization of QRPHONE/1 at this time,
while they reserve finite comment until all the returne (per above) are in, the
Medical Staff did stress the paramount importance proper rest and of not over-
taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular,
warm, balanced meals in accordance with the dietary restrictions usually imposed,
and compiete absence of alcohol, in order to prevent a relapse. So long 28 these
caveats are adhered to, however, there is no reason why he could not make some
more short trips during the next few months, if necessary. However, since he
also has an office to set up and we would like him to concentrate on the Kambona
offer, perhaps it would be a good idea to keep those trips to a minimum for the
time being.

3. The Medical Staff will be glad to review any further chemical tests per
para. 1 above suggestions, or any others which his doctor may have already run.

1. At their meeting on 4 September ORPHONE/1 submitted a
report to RODIGAST on his hospitalization for hepatitis. Attached
to his report is a copy of this medical record with results of
blood and urine analyses written in Serbo-Croatian. We are
forwarding a copy of the report under separate cover for evaluation
by the Medical Staff. We are interested in having as thorough as
possible an evaluation made of QRPHONE/1's illness in order that
we may assure ourselves of his condition and the degree to which
he ought to be active in the forthcoming months. We will appre-
ciate it if Headquarters will pursue this matter with the Medical
Staff and advise us of its findings and recommendations. .

2. Also forwarded under separate cover is a memorandum
prepared from RODIGAST's notes which elaborates upon QRPHONE/1's

HEPATITIS BourT

What I had thought was a touch of malaria and the extreme
fatigue I felt when I returned to London in July proved in
time to have been acute infectious hepatitis. The disease

-- which takes two to three weeks to develop -- was probably
contracted in Uganda. At least, I imagine so because my
principal contact in Kampala insisted on taking me to a r.umber
of local restaurants of dubious cleanliness to sample Uganda
delicacies.

Hepatitis was diagnosed by a doctor in Komiza, Vis, where
my family had been holidaying since the beginning of July,
and I was hospitalized in the isolation section of Split
Hospital (there 1s no hospital on Vis) on the 7th of August.

My liver was swollen by one finger and bleed and urine
analysis indicated a fairly severe infection. Treatment
consisted of terramycin and cortisone therapy, with massive
doses of vitamins.

I was put on a fat-free diet, which I have been told to
follow for at least six months. Naturally, no alcohol.

On 20 August, I was released from the hospital, mainly be-
eause I was pestering the doctors to let me go. ,2 was
told to have * "absolute rest* for four to six weeks and to
have another blood test wishin several weeks.

(Attached is the Yugoslav doctor's description of my case
and treatment, with results of all blood and urine analyses.
It is written @rmatten in Serbo-Croatian.)

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD 7 September 1968 :

SUBJECT: GEER Illness

1. The following information was obtained by Qagmaagp
from @eGe/1 at their meeting on 4 September 1968. It
supplements the report which was submitted by @iEeRmm—B/1 which
deals with his recent hospitalization for hepatitis.

2. Toward the end of his African trip @g@igs3y’1 had been

- feeling rather weak and nauseous, with no appetite. He was
constipated, feverish and had gas pains. These symptoms
persisted and after his return from Africa and on 6 August,
while in Yugoslavia on vacation, @@@3@§9/1 suffered from acute
gas pains and vomiting. He was taken from Vis, where he was
vacationing, to Split where he was hospitalized. The address
of this hospital is:

Opea Bolnica
Zarazni Odjel (Firule)
Split, Yugoslavia

His doctor was Dr. Juraj FILIPOVIC.

3. @eeey1's treatment was free inasmuch as he was able
to show his 8ritish National Health Card and a reciprocity
agreement exists between Britain and Yugoslavia.

4. 1 states that at no time did he receive
narcotics nor was he ever unconscious. During his stay in the
hospital a young British youth (Derek WHITTAKER, age 19, from
Shoreham-by-Sea, Surrey) was in his ward suffering from food
poisioning.

REVISED MEMORANDUM OP ORAL COMMITMENT

1. QRPHONE/1 collaborates with WOFIRM as a Field Agent who
provides certain services of a confidential nature. He has
received a Previsienal Operational Approval, dated 23 MAY 66-
Pinancial aspects of his. activity are charged to approved Project
QRPHONE.

2. QRPHONE/1‘s employment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965,
was originally formalized by a Letter of Agreement for a period
of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Commitment dated 4 °
1 September 1965. Under this MOC, which remains in effect (as
amended) since that date, ORPHONE/1*s employment continues on a
month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a
30-day notice.

3. QRPHONE/1 receives the following financial entitlements:

a. Compensation so computed as to give QRPHONE/] a
"tax-free" income of $800 per month (this figure
effective 1 July 1967).

NOTE: The actual breakdown of QRPHONE/1's finances
as carried on WOPIRM’s books is $800 monthly salary
and $70 per month tax supplement withheld at Head-"
quarters to discharge QRPHONE/1's WOLADY tax
obligation. These taxes are remitted through the
Covert Tax Committee. This procedure was devised
to honor the original "tax free” commitment made
at the time of his recruitment and at the same

~ :- time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY

citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.

b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel
unless these are paid by other sources in which
case WOPIRM will offset such outside reimbursement
against WOPIRM financial obligations to QRPHONE/1. :
Since security considerations preclude processing “
of detailed accountings for miscellaneous opera-
tional expenses, and as an added inducement to
QRPHONE/1 in connection with his obtaining certain
confidential information of interest to WOFIRM, a
small operational payment, as authorized by Chief,
LCPIPIT will be made to QRPHONE/1 for each day
@uring which he is required to be absent from his
home on confidential business.

NOTE: Write-off of the funds passed to QRPHONE/1
-. is to be effected on the basis of the procedure .

-."¥°> ef which is attached. This procedure is authorized

: in view of the security considerations applicable
to QRPHONE/1 and the need to limit the knowledge
of this operation within WOMACE.

office allowance of $100 per month.

mutually agreed upon for the relocation of himself and his

desirable by him and WOPIRM. NOTE: This provision was included

to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.

. agreed to repatriate QRPHONE/1 to WOLADY. This has been done
for operational reasons to enable QRPHONE/1 to qualify for
foreign residence. Should ORPURE be obliged to honor this commit—
ment, WOFIRM will guarantee this QRPURE commitment and will
reimburse QRPURE for any costs incurred.

6. LCPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by QRPHONE/1
of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-
accountable and which shall be charged against the operational
expense category of approved Project ORPHONE.

INLAND REVENUE KONOLOGUE (required)

Until April of this year (1968), I lived mainly on assistance

from my wife's family and occasional freelance journalisa

outside Britain, Also, I had some savings and investments
in America and Switzerland to draw upon. My brother-in-
law, Gordon Kaye, purchased a house at 32 Hartawood Road,
Stanford Brook, London, W.12 for us — the price of the
house being considered a loan to be repaid over the years

as is possible. My children's school fees were paid by
convenant by my brother-in-law, as well as a grant in
convenant to my youngest daughter.

I was not a legal resident of the U.K. until 8 April
1968, and on that date I began officially my duties
as Overseas Representative and Correspondent for Negro
Press International of Shicago, with a salary of $
per month. .

SEPARATE COVER ATTACHMENT TO:
OEPA-892

ARREST AND EXPULSION FROM SWITZERLAND
Brisue, 20 Jan. 1968.

The Milan-Geneva TEE reached the Swiss border at Brigue at
about 1030. It was evident that the Border Police were ex~
pectin=s me -- the usual lone civilian inspector of passports
Mas accompanied by a uniformed policeman. I was talcsen, with
baggage, to the station imxicration office. My wife went with
me, but was apparently not covered by the ban on me. When the
official in charge of the office phoned Lausanne and Berne, he
was informed that I was to be expelled immediately and that they
did not want to interrogate me.

Greet effort was made by the official in charge of the office

to be polite, especially then I made a rather vigorous protest
at the expulsion, claiming that I had never been informed of

the ban on my entry in Switzerland, said to date from 16 Dee. ~~
1963, and that, in any case, I had visited Switzerland on
numerous occasions since 1963 withentinterference. Moreover,

I was a professional journalist accredited to the United Mations
and was indeed on ry way to Geneva to visit the U.N. Office
there, I said. The official seemed somewhat baffled by this,
because he had been informed I was en route to Lausanne, but I
shoved my tickets valid to Seneva. Nevertheless, with the
greatest of apologics, IT was escorted -- this time by a plain-
elothesren,-- to a train back to Italy at_1130. My we cold have
Stored in Sarizevand bot Parked Rev ds veloen Wii meee

During my detention, my wife phoned Gilbert Etienne in Lausanne,
inforzing him of the situation, the Associated Press office in
Geneva (speaking to a Mr. Atkins) and the U.S. Press Attaché,  .:
S¥ezrxiic: Steiner, in Berne. Actually, I had told her to shone >
as many wire services as possible, but she assumed I also wanted.
to get the Press Attaché to protest on my behalf. In any case,
the shortness of time between trains prevented her from making
more calls.

When given the attached formal notice of the travel ban by the
Swiss official, I refused his request that I sign it and warned
that the expulsion was a violation of Swiss agreements concerning
the freecom of access to the U.N. Office in Geneva which I fully
intended to protest formally anc bring to world attention.

\
Later, from Verona, I spoke myself femx with Gilbert Etienne, who
was convinced -- quitez correctly, I believe -- that his phone is
tapped_and that my arrival was isarnes commmicated to the Swiss
Federal Police through a phone conversation I had with Etienne fron

Mian oi 1S Jan. (Ky tretn reservation vas made in !iilan, not

he had filed a story after cy wife's call about an American
\ Necro Journalist boing refused entry into Switzerland. He asked
for more background on me, claiming that New York had expressed
interest in developments. Atzins believed that I could get thi
ban lifted by protesting to the Swiss Press Attaché in London as
a professional newsman. He said he believed Swiss authorities
were rather jumpy about “suspicious" individuals entering the
country since the large Siafran shipments of Nigerian currency
to Zurich earlier in January. Whatever the real reason,
althoush I do resent not being able to talk with Etienne -- I
: was counting on hin to reestablish links with Nils Andersson
in Albania and to give me a picture of the altered situation
amons pro-Chinese Commmist parties in Western Europe since the
latest split from Jacques Srivpa's party in Belgium --, I think |
the expulsion fs a most use%ul incident to prove that IT am indeed
a good revolutionary and I intend to exploit it as fully as
possible, within reason. Tnat is, no overt diatribes against

iow the Man operates in Switzerland," say in the Los Angeles
Herald Dispatch, but to inform as many people on the Left as
possible of the incident and let them draw their otm conclusions.

Michael Bakafe/Petras Defte, who was expecting me in Geneva for
an interview on 22 jan. was informed by a wire from Verona that
force majeure prevented me from keeping the appointment and that
I would be writing him when I returned to London.

26 September 1967

MEMORANDUM FOR: CCS/KC

SUBJECT: QRPURE /CREBONY/1i Relationship

1, Thie will confirm our convereation of 18 September 1967, in
which we discussed CREBONY /1!'s plan to visit CRPURE sore time
during the week of 25 “eptember 1967, and you agreed to give CRPURE/2
prior warning of this visit. In accordance with the same conversation .
CREBONY/1 was briefed that his visit should be mainly a question of oe pO
touching base with ORPURE, maybe a friendly luncheon with C RPURE/2
o- but that no substantive diecussions affecting their ostensible rela- ;
tionship (i.c., amount of money, amount of QREBONY/1 production for
ORPURE, etc.) were to taka place. You were to brief CRPURE/2
along the same lines, and also to indicate to him that, contrary to our
original thinking, we-would now like to have QREBONY /1 given a by-
line, whenever ORPURE /2 feels he can do so.

2. Im addition to the above, we would appreciate it if you would
take up with CRPURE/2 (and/or ORPURE/1, az appropriate) the pos-
afbility of increasing the amount of money funded to CREBONY/! via
ORPOURE, As indicated to you, we would like to increase the current 1
$100.00 monthly to $300, 00 monthly, but would Like your careful a 4
examination with QRPURE principal(s) that this amount is not excea-
sive either in terms of their willingness to handle or in terms of
CRPURE's ostensible ability to cover.

3. Please also mention to CRPURE /2 our desire to have QREBONY/1
oper a small office in London, and our thought of perhaps including
QRPURE (along with other publications) as a name on the door or on
his letterhead. Would QRPURE/2 (or CRFURE/1) have =ny objections?
Would he have any objections if any of the other names are of more
radical publications? it would not be operationally feasible or desir-
able to let him know in advance which these would be, but since both

iitpnl
QRPURE's have been briefed carefully as to QREBONY/1's radical
aura, presumably they would have a good idea as to the kind of publl-
cations these might be.

4. For operational reasons, we would prefer that the arrange-
mente indicated in paras 2 and 3 above not be broached until after
QREDONY/I1's departure from the United States, some time in mid-
October. We will advise you of his departure so that you can make the
necessary arrangements thereafter at your convenience.

. 1. QREBONY/1 was recruited by WOFACT on 3 June 1965. This
recruitment was performed by an officer from WOMUSE/ICG since
GREBONY/1 (then known as STEBONY/1) was viewed as a “double agent”
penetration of pro-Chinese comsunist groups. CREBONY/] has per- i
formed well in a difficult and dangerous environment. He is a |
clandestine agent operating against targets violently anti-WOLADY
and of priority interest. The aduinistration of UREBOSY/1 requires !
special care since, by the very nature of his role, he is not i
typical of the average LCPIPIT asset. . | :

2. CREBONY/l1's initial employment was by Letter of Agreement
for a period of three nonths. This Letter of Agreement expired “ae
1 September 1965 and was replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Cosmitment ;
Gated the sane day. This oral employment agreement remains in.
effect at this date--soue two years later--, but has been amended
to adjust compensation. Certain inaccuracies in the original
MOC have also been corrected subsequent to its preparation. Given
the sensitive nature of GREBONY/1's relationship with WOPACT it
is sometimes diffieult to adapt the operational realities of his
situation to the administrative requirements of WOFACT. However,
with great understanding at home and in the field, we have reach

@ very manageable situation.

3. In order to codify the entitlements and procedures applicable.
to QREBONY/1's employment the undersigned has prepared the attached =.
revision of the HOC paderwhich CREBONY/1 is employed. It is requested]
that BUS approve this revised HOC and notify LCPIPIT of approval by
1S October.

REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT
(Revised to include all changes and amendments operative as of
14 September 1967)

. 1. QREBONY/1 is employed by WOFACT as an independent con—

7 tractor for certain services of a confidential nature. He has
received an Operational Approval, dated - FPinancial
aspects of his activity are charged to Project QREBONY.

2. GREBONY/1's employment under this agreement commenced
1 September 1965 and continues on a month-to-month basis. It
can be terminated by either party on 30-day notice.

3. QREBONY/1 receives the following financial entitlementss

wets inte Gp tpi te

a. Compensation so computed as to give QREBONY/1 a
"tax-free" figure of $800 per month (this figure effective
1 July 1967). NOTE: The actual breakdown of QREBONY/i's ~
finances as carried on WOPACT books is $700 monthly salary;
$100 non-accountable operational allowance; $70 tax supple-~
ment withheld at HQS to discharge QREBONY/1's WOLADY tax
obligation. These taxes are remitted through the Covert
Tax Committee.

‘

AA La

RSS

b. Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel,
unleas these are reimbursed by other sources in which case
WOPACT will offset such outside reimbursement against WOPACT -
financial obligations to QREBONY/1. Since security considera-
tions generally preclude the detailed accounting for mis- :
cellaneous travel expenses, per diem will be paid at the
Bate of $20 per day during periods of authorized travel.

This per diem authorization was qualified by a personal
xruling of Chief of Station, Paris/LCPIPIT dated 12 July 1965:

"If subject is absent from his home station on
authorized travel for part of one day and returns to
his home station the night of the dame day (i.e. if
no hotel expense is involved in the sense of overnight
accommodations), then he shall be entitled to draw
ve 1/2 of his authorized per diem of $20 per day (i.e. $10)."

4. QREBONY/1 will be compensated by WOFACT in an amount
maitually agreed upon for the relocation of himself and his .
family to a new residence if such relocation is considered
@esirable by him end WOPACT. NOTE: This provision was included
in QREBONY/1's original Letter of Agreement and was retained in
this MOC since it may be operationally desirable for QREBONY/1
to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.

S. LCPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by QREBONY/1
of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-
accountable and which shall be charged against the operational
expenses category of the budget attached to the FY 1963 project
renewal. :

6- QREBONY/1 signed a separate Secrecy Agreement (in true

neme) at the time of his original recruitment. Ho is aware that’

its provisions are still in effect.

7. QREBONY/1 is aware of all provisions of this Memorandan
of Oral Commitment with the exception of paragraph 5, which
@eseribes an internal WOFACT procedure, and certain aspects of
paragraph 3b, specifically that WOPACT is paying LNPORT taxes
in his behalf. NOTE: He was promised tax-free compensation
in his original recruitment and we have devised the current .

to honor this commitment while fulfilling the require-
ment that all WOLADY citizens pay taxes on funds received from
LEFORT.

1. LCPIPIT is revising the QREBONY Project files--which
have been rather haphazardly maintained over the past year or

so (much of this time the project was without a case officer).
In our attempts to locate basic project documents we have been
unable to find any copy of the provisions of the Operational
Approval applicable to QREBONY/1. We do have a copy of the -
Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW -
1591, 7 July 1966. Possibly the relevant document was destroyed
during the reduction of files attendant upon the LCPIPIT move,
or possibly it was inadvertantly not forwarded to LCPIPIT. At
any rate we will appreciate being sent a copy.

We are forwarding USC a copy of a letter sent QREBONY/1
by Jacques Verges‘ lawyer in which he makes a settlement offer
on behalf of his client. QREBONY/1 will probably accept this,
after a suitable waiting period, as it offers very telling and _
effective ammunition for use in his continuing battle to counter
Verges' allegation that he was a WOFACT agent. It is our reading
at this point that QREBONY/1 has been quite successful in this
effort and that this settlement from Verges will be the final
triumph in his campaign.

Returning to London froa Stocxkholn on 10 July, I wae egain queried
by Sritish I=-icration asout sy failure to register zs a permanent

tne Hone Office, but no ection was ever taxen because I rarely
rezained in tse country core than a month. Hovever, tais tale is
wearing thin and I fear taat I cay nave nuca more serious trouble
in the near future.

It would seen to ne that the best solution night be to becone

the official Lexdon correzpondent of Nel or any other outfit

that nignt have ce. I would need a letter to tha$ effect and

would require a notional salary of about $5,000 per year, I believe,
but even this aight raise questions from the British Inla:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: CILIBERTI Conversation with RNSLIVER 26 April Concerning His
Meeting with CREBONY/2

4. On 25 April BASTEAR told me that RYSLIVER was in London and was
ng to meet with QORESONY/1. BASTEAR accordingly suggested that
. RHSLIVER be debriefed by the undersigned the following morning. Accordingly
I wet with PHSLIVER for about one hour, from which meeting the following
highlights seen worth recordinz:

}

|

|

|

| : he 1 told SNSLIVER that we (WOFACT) had been interested in

{ QREBONY/2 at the time that he was writing for China Quarterly concerning
i his dispute with the editor of Revolution, Jacque Verses, but that wo
| _ 7° had lost tract of him of late, Wow that we are in QREBONY/1's howe

| . town, RNSLIVER was told that we and Headquarters would be interested
| in any information on QREBONY/1 which could be reported as a result

{

i

_ Of such meetings as RNSLIVER had had with bin,

B. RNSLIVER said that he had told Leo Labedz that he would like
to meet Ibrehin to gain some understanding o° what was going on in
the African exiled comnunity, particularly as it related to the Sino-
Soviet split. Labedz said that he thought that FNSLIVER would de auch
better by talking to QREBONY/) whom he, Labedz, said was one of the
few people around from whoa Labedz could learn anything.

caetentets Rp seme ee emee ae

C, RUSLIVER met QREBONY/1 at QRESONY/1's house, RNSLIVER did
not have a complete roster of those who were there to participate
in what RNSLIVER described as a "political bull seasfon", He
renenbered only (ia addition to himself and QREBONY/1) of Matthew
Wkoana and a girl from Mexico City named Sucesos, who he sald knew.
@ great deal about guerrille roingzs-on in Venezuela and whose
address he eaid was Calzada, Tacuboya 103, Mexico 18, RNSLIVER
eaid that Nkoana sald practically nothing throughout the evening,
apparently because he found RNSLIVER's presence odd and unnerving.

|

D. WHSLIVER was as impressed with OREBONY/1 as Labedz had
predicted he would be. He described QREBOSY/1 as resarkably knowl-
edgeable concerning Chinese factions of Communist sovements in
Western Europe and Africa, fe said that QRERONY/] had described
his recent trip to Nicosia and Cairo, had sentioned that he had
visited Dar-es-Salaam, that he knew Jacques Grippa, and that he
intended to visit Stockhole in connection with the Pussell Tribunal
and a possible Stockhoin visit by Robert Willfians,

E. RMSLIVER was particularly {mprossed by GREBONY/1's library
of radical books and paaphlets. RNSLIVER turned over to the under=
- signed for copying and return a recent issue of ¥illfams' The Crusader,
and a copy of QREBONY/1's own newsletter. These were recelved with
feigned interest, although of course we had earlier received the saze
iteas fros RODIGAST (already forwarded to Headquarters).

Fe SUSLIVER did not reall meeting Hra. ORTBONY/1, and did not
know how many children QREBONY/1 had. lie described QREBOXY/1's house
as attractively alddlo class, He was avare of the fact that QREBONY/1
had gone to Kenyon College and praised QREBUNY/1's writine skills,
QRESONY/1 showed him a nuaber of articles he hed written which
FPUSLIVER said completely folloved the Chinese Cowmunist line, RNSLIVER
was eurprised that soze of these articles had been printed in the United
States in spite of thédr political orfeataticn.

Verges. He nas now received a letter from his lawyer which seens to indicate
that Verges is willing to make some sort of settlesent—-althousii ne can only pay
in Algerian dinars. QPEBONY/1, of course, is willing to accept a settlement
provided it includes sone sort of apology from Verges. Arned with this apology
QRESONY/1 could then dispose of any lingering dcubts regarding nis political
reliability caused by Verges' accusations and would also have the ego gratification
of forcing Verges to eat his own words.

‘ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

1. QREBONY/1 told RODIGAST at their most recent meeting that he did not
have to file an overt tax form for 1566 because his gross overt income for 1966
was less than $600, This will not be true for the 1967 tax year and he will
have to file in the Spring of 1968. The operative sentence in the 1966 Tax
Guide For US Citizens Abroad, US Treasury Dept IR3 Pub No 54 states--"Every
citizen of the United States, regardless of where he resides who is under 65
years of age and has a sross income of $600 or more during a tax year must
file an income tax return." .

2. For the record the undersigned who is as yet unfaziliar with all
administrative details, would appreciate HQS confirmation of the above.

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

See paragraph 4,

1, Transmitted under separate cover is an excerpt from a recent
Senate debriefing of a PBRUMEN defector, in which GREBONY /1's

name was mentioned,

2. We do not believe that the testimony is particularly awkward for
QREBONY /1, and while we bad an opportunity to have this portion of the
testimony stricken from the record, we elected not to do anything about
it since it would have involved revealing \. OF ACT interest in QREBONY/L,

3. FYI, In order to avoid any concern on the part of QRPURE should
this portion of the testimony ever hit the press, KAMMERMAYER
mentioned the reference to CREBONY /1 in low key to QRPURE at a recent
meeting. QRPURE exhibited no concern,

4, Please have RODIGAST brief QREBONY /l concerning the testimony
at an early opportunity.

SUBJECT: PLeld Investigation of QRESOEY)
Qrevony Clearance. (201- 306052) .

L Pursuant to cur conversstion of 11 February in your office, this
requests that the usual field background investigition not be
undertaken in the clearance process instituted for QREBOHY.

2. We exke this request for limitation because of our strong belie?
that such aon investigation vould rm an wmacceptably high risk--spproaching .
certainty--of causing verious damage to QREBONY's reputation and therefore
his effectivences vith the targets against vhich he is directed as an |
inferment. In tha past, both here and abroad, QREBONY hee mode varm enmaics,
es well as frieads, among dissident end leftist circles. He hes particularly '
altonated beth U.S. fad on Eescunhve panecter of the Pune Phan ar tine, Oumntiee

weli.as from his oun testimony, that ouch hostility has texen the formof -,
charges--completely false at the tine--that he was an ODERVY or KUBARK agent.
(aprarentiy 8 favored mmar technique in euch circleag this charge has bsen
leveled in other cases with equal lack of justification.) ‘These allegations
against QREEOZY’ bave not prevented him from winaing the epparent confidence
of many leftist target clements sho, if they ere mare of thon at all, no
doubt realine the prevalence of such backbiting and gossip end vubo have not
been prevented froa developing personal and confidential relations vith hin. -
Such charges, however, do represent @ dormant vulnerability: they have mdo 5.
Subject something of a controversial figure in a millies vnich rightly feels
- itself a target for intelligence collection and is extremely sensitive to the
@angors of penstration.

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI of

REP: A. PALP $933 (i 96553)
B. OFLA 3128 (18 Hovember 1965)

1. We have discussed the substance of the question raised
in Ref B through the regular Headquarters channel with the
QDENVY Rep bere who has acted as a point of liaison for QRESOHY
oe iron in the past. to passed on, also, the aatorials which

propared for the ODENVY representative vith whom you are
in contact in Paris. We raised spocifically the question of
Passing GREBONY's identity to the Paris ODENVY representative,
which you mentionod in Bof B, stating that, so fax as KUDARE
is concerned, we had no objections. The QDEHVY representative
here, however, thought that this might serve to confuse gonc-
whet tho lines of coordination for QREDONY‘'s information, for
which OQDENVY headquarters has sole responsibility. Ue there-
foro felt that we should continue the preseat arrangeaent by
which, im effect, GREBRIY's identity is held here at the point
whore his material within ODENVY originates. He appreciated,
however, your initiative in filling in tha Paris ODBNVY
representative on tha tarrots which QREBORY can sorvice, thus
alerting him to posgiblo leads he aight look into. lia suyzests.
also that we be kept avare of your liaison with ODENVY in the
Z4eld to quard a:ainst false confirmation or other possible
duplication which could lead to confusion here ean those
suartert of QOEHVY responsible fer processing the GHEDOESY
material.

2. With respoct to Freedonvays, discussed in Ref A,
and Q's possible relationship with it, we will report aoparately.

the use of the S/W system prescribed by MKTOPAZ per Reference C. QREBONY/1
took one carbon sheet of the system with him on a brief trip to North Africa
end used it for four massages in the latter part of June. Concurrently,

Paris Station TECHS, on LCPIPIT's behalf, requested in OFPT 10348 that

METOPAZ prepare for QREBONY/1"s use an S/W carbon pad which would alleviate the
carbon concealwent problem for the agent, The pad was received subsequently
end passed to QREBONY/1 on 18 July 1965, at which time his original single
carbon sheet was withdraw,

ac EL

2. QREBONY/1 first used his new &/W pad for a message dated 22-

July 1965, cozments on which were transmitted to interested KUBARK Headquarters

end Field componente in Reference 5, QREBONY/1 underwent a corrective briefing

on the use of his pad on 4 August 1965, carbon No. 1 (rearmost of three in the
“"" back of his pad) was withdrawn since it bore an imprint of the 22 July message,

and QREBONY/1 was authorized to use carbon No. 2 (middle of three) but only for

"essential" messages. (a 24 July S/W massage was also critiqued at the 4 August

meeting-~because the carbon impression was relatively weak.)

phe AE

S/W pad except for “essential” messages, QREBONY/1 did not employ it egain
until 11 October 1965. The nature of the message indeed met the criteria for
use of the pad, but as in the 22 July letter the message was clearly legible
without development. To quote Paris Station TECHS:

"SW impressions were clearly visible under Ultraviolet Light
(short wave and long wave) and also under a plain desk light.”

On the basis of this report, QREBONY/1's previous performance in use of the
pad, and the fact that the next point from which he was to use the pad would
be Algiers, LCPIPIT determined that the risk of compromise outweighed the
macessity of QREBONY/1 carrying this comsunications system with him and
withdrew the S/W pad on 20 October 1965. LCPIPIT retains possession of

opinion of MKTOPAZ on the following points:

2 :

the pad which contains the two renaining carbon sheets (No. 2 detached and
inserted in the back of the pad, No. 3 still bound in the pad.) The 11 Cetober
message is clearly legible to the naked eye on carbon Ho. 2.

4 Of grester concern to LCPIPIT, however, were the folloving
additional coaments of Paris Station TECHS regarding the 11 October message?

"The envelope you sent has evidence of tempering. There was glue
bleeding plus fiber tears. Plus, additional glue had been added
to the upper flap (glue aust have run and was sticking inside on
the letter.)"

§. In the 20 October meeting at which his S/W ped vas withdremn

QREBONY/2 stated that he had written the 1] October message on a sheet of glass,
perhaps with # pencil that was too soft. He conceded that there wee some imprint
on tha carbon, but nothing which could be read on the ectual message sheet. He
afd he wrote the message ast 1100 hours when he was alone at his home end burned
the remainder of the message stack inmediately. He said he then put the message
in an envelope immsdiately snd sealed it gently under another sheet of paper to
evoid rubbing it. He added that he then placed the proper postage on the envelope,’
placed it in his pocket, and mailed it two hours later at the closest mailbox °
to him home. QRESONY/1 aseerted that he did not reopen the letter after sealing
end vas certain that his wife had not seen it.

6. Pursuant to LEPIPIT’s exploration of this question with QRESONY/1L
we sent an informal note to MKTCPAZ via a Paris Station Officer on 20 October

1965 requesting assistance in efforts to determine vhether QREBONY/1'a
correspondence was indeed subject to tampering. MKTOPAZ prepared five “beoby-

Subject: QREBONY/1 ~ Security at hore

. 1. At his 17 Novexber meeting with Rodizest Q2=3CNY/1 (Q) was
asked some questions concerning keep of files ond correspondence. He keeps
copies of all correspondence (except routine letters transnitting articles
he hagw ritten, for example) in a file to which his wife has access.
He maintains a minimim of questionable notes, end keeps ris personal
notebook (with addresses, cxpenses, etc.) in nis coaz pocket day and nigkt.

2. His wife has two brothers. The one to whez Q owes money is

Gordon, a_chartered accountant, who during World We: It wes in Spinish :

Military Intellizeace. He visits the Q hoxe to tring gifts from the wife's ,

mother to the Q children, but has a cat-and-doz relztionship with Q's :
- wife; indeed, he will not stay for a xezl because he cen!t stend talcing :

to her, and the feeling is mutual. Q is certain she would never think of

confiding in Gordon, for exazple to say: "Lock et these awful letters

Q bas written!" Gordon is more lixely to confide in Q hinseif. Gordon's

politics are apparently solidly conservative. (His wife's other brother,

less involved with thea, works for Renk.)

RANA SERN, EATEN A NAMASTE LETT RPC IRD 92

: 3. Q mailed the three test letters as follows: one in the morning,
the two following on successive afternoons, 2% the local tox in the normal :
way. One of the three envelopes actueily contained a note: a sinzle ‘ : {
statement that "Willian" (Guillerao) had not cefected but his brother had oo

_ (Cabrera Infante), information acquired from a Cuban official (see
separate contact reports).

4. Q wanted to get a lawyer's opinion on what regulations govern
publishing a pericdicai in his country of residence (he is not of course :
officially a resident at all). Sensing additionzl costs and unnecessary 1
formality, Rodigast sugzested that he xeep it on tke basis of being :
&@ correspoment's reports, not a separate comercizl press venture : “oy
requiring eventual licenses of payment of business taxes, at least for - t
the time being. Mailed first cless, the materiel should require no permit :

from the mail authorities. A contact had suggested ne might have ‘
difficilty with the locals (see report of Qts 15 Novecber contact with WP). t

JAGUAR Report on STEBONY/1
REQUIRED - REFERENCES:

Ref: A OBLA 43,522, 2 July 1965
B OELA 43,802, 11 August 1965

1. The following is the text of a JAGUAR report on STEBONY/1
and Marc SCHLEIFER, JAGUAR states that the information was
received from a "most secret and delicate source which has been
found reliable on previous occasions."

“STEBONY/1 was in contact with Marc SCHLEIFER while the
latter was staying in London with his family, en route for
Algeria. SCHLEIFER had planned to leave London for Algiers
via Paris on the 2nd June, but he deferred his departure in
order to meet STEBONY/1, It seems that SCHLEIFER wanted, if
possible, to visit Tanzania also. STEBONY/1 apparently was
prepared to help SCHLEIFER and his family to find accommodation
while they were in London because they had little money. He is
also reported to have said that there was a possibility of his
co-operating with SCHLEIFER in Africa.

“According to our source, SCHLEIFER, while in London,
arranged to contact the Tanzanian Mission, in conrection with
a job in Dar-es-Salaam which might be taken by either SCHLEIFER
or STEBONY/1."

2. Ref A contains previous JAGUAR comments about STEBONY/1 and
SCHLEIFER, of about the same period. While TIFFANY was in London
(which puts it at the right time) STEBONY/1 was in touch with
SCHLEIFER, and TIFFANY should be-able to compare JAGUAR's comments
with what STEBONY/1 said at the time. Ref B reflects a different
contact between the two, from a different source.

The results of the evaluations vere that the reports based on SIRBOHY/2's
elicitation contained "nothing more than chit-chat and opinion" with no new
information that could be disseminated. As indicated in the last sentence .
of reference this result ves not unanticipated by ICPIPIT.

In view of STEBONY/1"s reportorial cepstilities however, ve hope that his
continued efforte to elicit and report timely information will be vigorously

1. JAGUAR, in acknowledging receipt of the processed STEBONY/1
material that we forwarded to them, have also asked for "further
information about Francois MASPERO and Professor Nguyen KIEN. We
should be most grateful for any further identifying particulars
for both MASPERO and KIEN and with regard to the latter, we should
particularly like to know his present position in connection with
"Africa, Agia, Latin America Revolution’ and whether he still holds
a teaching appointment in Frpdce."

2. JAGUAR's note was shown to RODIGAST in London on 12 August,
just before RODIGAST met with STEBONY/1. LCPIPIT please provide
anything that can be had for passage to JAGUAR.

3. As should be fairly apparent, I think, from reading the .
material we passed to JAGUAR, plus the fact that there has been
no “Revolution” for lo: these many rnonths, the status of anyone
connected with the magazine is about as uncertain as the status
of the magazine itself. Nonetheless, we will be happy to let
JAGUAR know as much as we can.

1. BAIRN, a sensitive SMOTH! operation, provides the following
report relating to STEBONY/1 (date of info, 26 July 1965):

“"STEBORY/1 (previously in touch with Pablo FERNANDEZ
while in Londen, en route with family to Algiers for the
international conference postponed vhen Len BRLLA was cver-~
thrown) calls Pablo FERNANDEZ, tells him he (S/1) is just
back from North Africa if the confernece is held-in Novenber.
Says he has been unable to get any nevs of (Marc) SCHLEIFFE,
and asks whether Pablo has heard of him. Pablo says he had
a letter, brought by hand from SCHLEIFFER in Algeria, saying
he (SCELEIFFER) was going the next week to Cairo, and would
write to Pablo from there. He has not yet written. S/1l says
they had hunted for him high andlow in Algiers -— he disappeared
completely from the conference scene, and they thought that per-
haps he had got mixed up in the (troubles between the vew
regime and Ben BELLA's faction), Pablo assures 8/1 that
SCHLEIFFER is all right. He knows this from a negro journalist,
oa “the Guardian” in the U.S.A. and coming from Pennsylvania,
who covered the Algiers conferace preparations. The journalist's
name ig, Larry HENRY or something similar. Pablo and S/l agree
to meet to-morrow (27th July), S/l will call Pablo then to fix
ime and place. At 10.35 S/l calls FERNANDEZ, arranges ‘to call
for him at the Babassy at 13.30 hours for them to lunch together."

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

RaF. OFiA-Z541, 22 June 1965

1. Subject to Brussels Station views, Headquarters believes that
STEBONY's proposal in Reference is 4&-good one end very consistent vith
our interests that he develop his access and acceptability within the
circles of which Ref Iden A is a significant figure. We realize that
the picture is a complicated one, and that Iden A of Ref may or may not
yet prove to have the staying power of the successful political figure. |
At the same tine, it does seem that he is the most outstanding leader
of the enti-revisionists today, and es such merits our attention.

2. With regard to Reference pera 4's concern about possible danage
to our national interest by publication of the book in English, ve tend
to side vith STEBONY in feeling that the support vnich such a publica»
tion might render to our enemies could not really be detected by the
naked eye. Similarly, while agreeing with the sentinent that vould
critically scrutinize all proposals cy new assets, we note that STEBOHY
is, indeed, supposed to be seeking to remain status among his former
associates, and that Ref proposal does not, to our view, contain any
hint which would suggest that in following out this line of action at
our direction, he is motivated by eny ulterior or concealed aim different
from that vhich led us to impose the commission in the first place.

3. We are attempting to get a rough translation done on a priority
basis. STEEONY, of course, should understand that such a translation
will be unfinished, und should be carefully reviewed for the proper
“feel,” to rule out usage or interpretation vhich STEBOHY, with his
background, would never have inferred frou the French text. Banethe-
less, as the document has come to hand only on 2 July, and given the
holiday veekend, the limitation on the number of translators available,
the existence of other translation assignmments, and, finally, the pouch
transit time back to Rone, ve regret that it will not be possible to
get this product to RODIGAST for his 15 July meeting.

measured 8 by 5 inches and was light tan in color. A confirza- .
tion of its receipt would: be appreciated.

Of course, I understood about the service, the newsletter,
not being a definite thing. In any case, I am not looxing for
a sinecure, but for a good, deep cover and that seemed to be ones
It also gave me sometaing to offer contacts zmnbe and would have
stréngthened ny position considerably. At present, my cover.is
as light as the Experor's new clothes. a

Still no positive reply from any publication, 22 the States,

and the seneral silence from ny Anerican "friends" 4s not very
encouraging. Here, the situation is much-better,-and if I can
get to Algiers in good tine, after visiting Grippa and Andersson
and seeing soze contacts in Paris, my position will be better,

Action requested: Paragraph 3.

1. Career Agent Rufus FP. RODIGAST has been briefed by Paris/
ICPIPIT on an ad hoe basis to date récariing information on the Afro—Agtes
national liberation movement of operational interest to his handling and
guidance of STEBONY/1. As the STRRONY operation progresses, however, it is
LCPIPT?'s intention that those handling STHBONY/1 becom more knowledgeable
on the subject of the national liberation movement than STZBONY/1, hiucslf,
a6 a spans to ensure the best possible operational guidance to the agent end

te provide another element of egent control--superior knowledge. “ab

ra 2. LOPIPIT's Limited files include two basic documents:

S\ Attachaent to OFPLY 630, and Book Dispatch No. 4463. We also have selected.
dieseainations and reports on Chinees Commmist activities in Africa. what
would be most useful, however, would be 4 collection of reports and analyses,
whether overt or covert, discussing the following topics: a) Jacques GRIPPA

o and the pro-Chinsse European Commmist factions;: b) tho Afro-Asian Journalists
\y Association (the Headquarters TPRANSACK o/o has had a file on this organization’
ener ¢) the individual national liberation movements and their leaders;
a) operations of the national liberation movemants, individually and

|| goltectivey, out of such centers as Algiers (at least up to 19 June 1965).
Dar es Sslacm, Accra, Cairo, Djakarta, Havana, etc/.; ©) national liberation
movement relations with, and operations out of, the Bloc, both Moscow and Peking
i oriented; f£) support and guidance of the national liberation movement ea
yoy nen-Bloc commmist parties and selected fronts. .

Be He Fecognize that much of the information on the above
mentioned topicn may not yet be collated, if indeed it is available; however,
we should appreciate reoeiving from Headquarters such materials as you feel
would best meet LCPIPIT's operational needs in workingswith STEBONY/1. Of
special valus would be a bibliography of overt writing on the subject, greatly
alleviating the security problem and aere logistics of bringing RODIGAST and
a large volume of classified reading together, in a secure environzent, over

At their 15 March meeting, CREBOSY/1 and RODIGAST discussed
GREBONY/1°s running his own pro-Chicom group, at least as a
paper organization to allow him to gét close to target conferences
and institutions as a bona fide delegate rather than bystander.
QREBONY/1 feels that if not done right this could cause trouble,
because of usual organizational rivalries. Re is thinxing of
beginning by writing and circulating a statement in sunport of

the statement on “Afro-American Liberation" which arpeared in

the 6 December Ad Hoc Bulletin (Marxist-Leninist) in Chicago.

He would use a pseudonym to sign his statement, but would let

all his friends now that the pseudonyx was really himself, and

he might use Manchanda’s address. Perhavs Gripna would agree to
circulate or print it. If this statement goes over, CREBONY/1
could escalate into a small organization. He will show RODIGAST

a craft of his statexent, but also will discuss it with Manchanda
for “ideological purity’.

seact DTDORIC/Operational
QREBONY/Salary Raise for QREBONY/1
(ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES:

1, At the time of his recruitment in June 1965, QREBONY/1 was told that his
$600 wonthly tax-free salary would be raised to $800 once he got a job in a target
organization, vhich of course was the goal of his planned summer activity in

Algiers.

2. Through no faulc of his own, the Algiers assignaent (and other possibil-
itfes, suca as Djakarta) evaporated shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, WOFACT changed
its signals and eventually decided to base QREBONY/1 in Europe targeted against

individuals end groups in various countries.

3. From the beginning, QREBONY/1 has proved wore than satisfactory as an
agent. tie has carried out assignments given to hin with knowledge and tact and
the proper spirit, has used his own initiative as wuch as our guidance, and has:
not violated our instructions, No one will argue that ne hasn't proved to be
better than ve collectively thought he would be, and in terms of his om
abilities—apart from targets which may or may not be accessible to hir-—-he is
getting better all the tize,

4. Uast year, about a year later than CREBONY/1 eicht have expected his
salary to go up from $600 to $800, we raised it to $790. He was pleased, and he
has not complained as euch as he used to about a shortage of funds. (Presumably
QRESONY/1 is responsive to the generally good treatment he has had, to the ‘
respect for bis as an iudividual and tie appreciation of hie services; probably
he is carried along as such by his om personal satisfaction in knowing he is
meeting requiresents and continually breaking new ground.)

5S. Kevertheless, LCPIPIT believes the time hac coue to raise QRELOXY/1's
salary to the prosised level, We can all agree that ve are still setting his
services cheap; QREBOSY/1 receives no quarters, living allowance, or educational
allowance for his children, His increased gratitude, the relief he will undoubt-
edly feel at being able to reduce his present financial] worries, are more than
worth the extra $100.

STANFORD stated that GIBSON passes on messages from WILLIAMS and will be the
man coatacted by whoever is designated as a courier to go to China to get the money.

INFORMATION CONCERNING |

i

A source of this Bureau who has furnished reliable
information in the past recently advised that during the 3
Fall of 1966, a member of an Italian pro-Chinese Marxist- 2 ij
Leninist organization stated that one Richard Gibson was . 1
suspected of being a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency. i
According to this individual, Gibson recently had been in 4
Milan, Italy, in the company of a female secretary from Paris, fy
whose home is in New Rochelle, New York. At that time i
Gibson remarked his travel and activities were possible !
because he had married a wealthy English woman. Other things
were said which aroused the suspicions of the Italian.”

According to our source, the Italian pro-Chinese
Marxist-Leninist subsequently relayed his suspicions concerning
Gibson to Rene Raindorf, a member of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of Belgium (Marxist-Leninist).

Raindorf reportedly thereafter met in Brussels, Belgium, with ~
Gibson although he had indicated the Belgian pro-Chinese
communists would look into the charges of the Italian Marxist-

; Leninist.

SUBJECT: Request for Approval for Operational Use of

U.S. Free-Lance Writer - QREBONY/1

1. This memorandum submits a recommendation for your approval pursuant
to CSI 240-6, 10 January 1963, paragraph 6, governing operational involvement
of personalities in the field of journalism. This request concerns cover
support for GREBONY/1, an asset currently handled by CA Staff, and involves
the cooperation of Russell R. DeBow, a Chicago city official and proprietor
of the Negro Press International Inc. GREBONY/1 was granted a POA on 23 May 1966,
and a full operational approval is pending. The project under which he is
handled was approved by Acting ADDP on 14 June 1906. Mr. DeBow was grented
a Covert Security Approval on 19 April 1966. :

CR La ba RANE RIPPER PLC oe oe

2. QREBONY/1 is an American Negro e.patriate journalist and author
presently residing in London. He is the author of one novel and numerous
contributions to a wide variety of publication, such as the Kenyon Review,
Monthly Review, The Nation, The Liberator and others. He worked as a reporter
for the Philadelphia Arro Americen in 1950, for Agence France Presse in 1959,
for CBS in 1960 and, in Europe, for the now defunct, pro-Chinese magezine
Revolution. As a result of broad contacts and acceptance among radical,
pro-Chinese and Negro militant circles, he has offered valuable access to
important targets spanning four continents, and has demonstrated considerable
skill in elicitation and exploitation of contacts for intelligence purposes
in the process. The immediate and paramount operational objective for this
agent is to gain direct access to hostile political targets in North Viet Nam a
and China. The outstanding requirenent to be met in support of this objective, -
and of his continued effective exploitation generally, is the development of
@ backstopped and viable explanation for at least a portion of his income,
which presently derives almost exclusively from clandestine CIA surport.

The proposal outlined below represents the conclusion of considerable research,
including an interview with Mr. DeBow, to identify suitable cover arrangements
which vould make possible this explanation.

3. Mr. DeBov, a lavyer, is an Administrative Assistant to the Mayor of 4
Chicago as well as a long time, if casual, contact of Domestic Contacts Service.
His background includes assignment to the Intelligence Division of the Chicago
police and cooperation with CIA in the course of a trip to Africa in 1961.

Mr. DeBow also is part ower and in effective control of a very small feature
syndicate in Chicago, the Negro Press International, Inc., which distributes
rewritten news to Negro newspapers in the United States on a subscription basis.

4. On 20 June 1966, Mr. DeBow was approached by representatives of CA Staff
and Central Cover Staff, acknowledging CIA connection, and interviewed with a 4
view to determining the feasibility cf using his service to backstop modest
payments to GREBONY/1 for real or ostensible contributions of feature stories
and reporting. (Since the contact was made to develop information pertinent
to the present request for DDP approval, the interview was conducted on a
hypothetical basis: QREBONY/1's identity was not revealed nor were any
commitments entered into.) ‘This conversation, despite its limitation, demonstrated
clearly that such an arrangement involving Mr. DeBow and his firm would be :
practical from Mr. DeBow's point of view and well suited to the needs of the t
QREBONY Pre‘ect. Mr. DeBow grasped the problem involved and suggested various H
means by which he could plausibly implement a cover arrangement should this
be our decision. He was made avare of and understood the incongruity between
his and QRESONY/1's ostensible political positions, and stated that this need
offer no inpediment to creation of the type of relationship which vould be
involved. ‘he nature of Mr. DeBow's feature service and its modest size
clearly enhance its usefulness and appropriateness for our objectives.

Mr. DeBow, in conclusion, expressed his agreement in principle to participate

A Provisional Operational Approval is granted fer the use of this SubJect
as set forth belo.

A Provisional Overational Approval issued bv CI Staff grants the sane
authority, cn a temporary basis, fcr the use of an individual as the authority

based, hovever, only on preliminary file checks and investigation and is sub-
Ject to a further final review when all investigation is caxpleted.

“Q) POA is granted to utilize Subject im an international context to exploit his
contacts and/or assotiations with a wide variety of personalities and organizations
{particolerly Cuban and Chinese) engaged in “anti-imperialist” propa.anda operations.
Suoject will be expected to renew nis oid relationships and expand 27s circle of
contects with Afro-Asian naticnal liberation leaders, pro Chinese Communist, end
similar personalities and to report general political and biograrhic material reia-
tive to the interests, activities and plans of such individuals and wheir organizaticn

(2) Requirements passed to Subject will be confined, insofar as it is opera-
donally feasible, to instructions for the refinement and compleveness of the reporting
he is capable of providing from his normai intercourse with source personalities.

8s New Contact, Carole Piiia

1. We are manifesting reports and correspondence concerning QREZONY/1's new
contact, Carole Pifia, an American, age 31, born in New York City (possibly Bronx.
County), whose father’s last name was Appel or Appell. lier husband's name is
Carlos Pifia (Mexican), but she is separated from him and he is seeking a divorce.
She holds US passport, No. D633873, issued 5 August 1963 in New York; it comes up
for renewal in August (at which tine she expects to be in Zone). She is afraid
that her having traveled to Cuba in 1964 with a Progressive Labor delegation will
hurt her chances of getting a renewal of her passport.

2. Subject had been having a series of political and amorous affaires during
her stay in Dar, and was in serious trouble when Q met her. After rejecting Dennis
Phorbeah’s advances, she was in serious danger of being declared a prohibited
immigrant; Q befriended her, and he and Colman Ferrer of the Cuban Embassy (who
had been having an affair with her) saw that she got out of Dar safely. Qwas ©”
to meet her in Cairo (but in fact had no intention of doing so) and later caught
up with her in Rome. She indicated a desire to work with Q (without quite knowing
for whom she would be workingz--he hinted rather broadly tu her that-he was in
cahoots with "our friends in the East,” but it will be noted that in one of her
letters there is this disarwing phrase: she warns him about how to deal with
certain persons and adds: “be cool with then--do not show your true colors (what=
ever they are)").

3. Q seized on the opportunity of using subject as an unwitting inforuent
and eventually agent on the same basis. She submitted to an interview on tape
in a Rome hotel room which lasts about 2-1/4 hours, in whicn Q debriefs her on

her knowledge of every Tanzanian, liberation movement, or dloc personality with
whom she had contact, and in view of her attractiveness and willingness She KRG:

& Q feels that she 1s emotionally unstable--his firmness in dealing with
her, his making i% clear he was not out for ier body, have made him a guardian
and true friend. She seems to be a good political reporter, understanding her
own (confused) political yearnings and where her various contacts stand; bre .
also seems to have a good memory for details. Q says that her “anti-revisionisn”
is incipient anti-Communism, He could eventually recruit her as an ODYOXE witting
agent, but that would take a lot of time and trouble; with much less effort he
could effect s false-flag recruitnent, and indecd, he nas already done this on an
informal basis by making it clear that he was collecting material for nis Chicom
friends, She would undertake further assignments for him. iie actually asked her,
“Suppose I asked you to go somewhere, would you g0?" To which she replied, "If
it's not cold." It is unlikely, however, that she would be sble to return to Dar
because of Phombeah's hostility. Wherever she goes, her main asset will be her
physical attraction. .

5. She ‘could be debriefed further on any point raised in the tape interview.
The ideal would be to have the questions by the time Q goes to Rome in the second
half of April, but this does not seem to be a likely possibilicy.

DTDORIC QRPREY CREBONY BE TOF ICES
Relations with JAGUAR

LOND 2425, 2 March 1966

1, A number of lengthly and fruitful discussions have
been held with JAGUAR officers regarding our continued
running of GRZEONY in the U.K, Their comments on the
quality of CR[ZONY's reporting hat@been reported from time
to time. Similarly, ve will not dwell here on the nechanical
arrangements we have evolved (with SXOTH's agreement) to
expedite the passage of infornation to JAGUAR, on the one
hand, and avoid duplicate reporting (prinicpally by passing
the same materials as CS dissems to SMOTH) on the other
hand, Suffice it here to say that achieving both of these
goals, without compromising C320ECNY as a source throughout
both JAGUAR and SMOTH (due largely to the wide range of

- areas he reports on), is a complex problem. Ve think ve

have reached a mutually satisfactory arrangement for
achieving both ains.

2. What we are concerned with here, then, is JAGUAR‘'s
permission for us to run CRSf0NY from here, for the tine

being at least. The exact phrasing from JAGUAR's letter,
agreeing to our request is: "ith regard to the continued

use of QREBONY by your service on a temporary basis while
he remains in this country ve have no objection to this
provided we are kept fully informed of as much detail as.
possible,”

3. JAGUAR pointed out that CREBONY operates in the

same areas as some of JAGUAR's own agents, and this necessitates’

a fair amount of frankness regarding his activities in the
U.K. We have made evcry effort to date to display to then
that frankness. In return, JAGUAR has been cooperative, if
not downright helpful. In one of our discussions, SMILL
confidentially stated that one of their sources had quoted

a sub-source as saying that CREBONY had admitted tohim that
he is a KUBARK agent. We assured JAGUAR that GRESO0NY is
under instructions not to reveal his KUBARK relationship,

of course; that QREBONY is not supposed to be recruiting any
sub-agents and has not done so; that the remark could well
have been made in jest, in reference to the charges levelled
against CREEOXY three years ago (or longer). tie told JAGUAR
that it would obviously be advantageous for us to know to
whom QREBONY is alleged to have made the statement, and ve
would be grgateful if JAGUAR could tell us. We have repeated
this request in writing, but with no reply to date. SMILL
stated at the time that he had doubts about whether they
could identify to us the person who had made the statement; he
was sure that they could not go back to their agent for :
elaboration without showing an undue interest in CRZBONY. We

. may yet hear who the person waS. All this is rapeated here

merely to indicate how far JAGUAR will go to be helpful, and
how far, to date, they will not go.

A. QR-BONY/1 (Q) gives the convincing impression that he is at hone
in his new work. He responds «ell to su >-zstions and instructions, adds
suggestions of his own for icsroving the slan~-- an indication that he
wishes to please. in the begi-r.ing he showed a tenuency to raise minor
objections involving personal z:terial problems (e.+., inconvenience to
family life o: a long tdy) but less of this was remarked as he cane to
realize that requirezents were to be reasonable and he was to be treated
as a beman being with his ovm oroblems.

He has stated that he zould not continue his present involvement
with target personalities and institutions if it were not that we wish
him to, i.e., his om inclination would te to withdraw irom the political
fringe. Rodigast feels that this is consistent with his background,
which was not a varty career; in his youth he was willfully apolitical
end hostile to the "ovement"; later he was involved in osposing party
people in his hew York work; in Faris he didn't get along wit: nis party
friends (the affair of the forged letter) and or course broke with the
magazine crowd there.

He seems to be genuinely comnitted to working against enemies
of CDY.KG, ready to accept even deeper commitment; he has expressed
no reservations as to what he will do. He doesn't object to reporting
on old -riends, fellow :BPROGIS, ev al. He raised no objection to
FLUTTER, or using s/w technioves (which he took with hin on a trip to what
was then 2 very hostile area, where he had known enemies, and vhere
there was a recent history of sealing rouchly with outsiders). when
orders conflict with personal desires (for example, when he plamned to
spend a weekend in < city he enjoys bub was told he should proceed
im-ediately to his next stopping place), he obeys without hesitation.

‘the foregoing is a collection of miscellaneous facts, cut taken
together they paint the vortrait of a promising agent, both in terms
of motivations and abilities.

B. Rodigast's knowl-dse of Q's acvitude in the months prior to-
recruitcent (June 1955) is licited. Rodigest has the impression ¢ had
simply reached the end of his rope-- he had nowhere to fo, he hed
earlier decided that he would like to work for or at least cocperate with
ODYOKS (although earlier atteapis to make contact met with no success).
The humene treatment received ai the hands of his recruiter, the
subsequent sympathetic handlin: by his case oificer, undoubtedly
convinced hin that he had not nede a mistake.

The material factor is not to be underestimated.
The dezoralizing position of living on his wire and worse, on her fanily,
must have lowered his resistance to any possible alternative. Rodigast
simply coesn't know how Q might have responded to a reasonable offer
from enexies of ODYCX: at that point. The prospect of immediate engasement
at a decent wage may have been cecisive.

Since that time, Rodigast feels Q's motivation has been reinforced
and perhass considerably alterea: he has been asked to do obviously

sata tn nae ng ee ane po sm

given reasonable instructions on how to ace-nolish them; he sees that
others are concerned for his personal safety and material wellbeing.
Rodigast has taxen pains to avoii giving the impression that there was
any con®usion or error or difference of viexpoint in running the project
(even at a time when there were plenty of all three); such problexs were

resolved before being t2ken up with G, and thus he has a somewhat rosy
vi-w of the operation. ihe setisfaction of acconzlishment (i.e., being
able to produce useful answers. to our questions) is surely a factor
in his present attitude.

Though lizht-sxinned, with a voice and accent which would be
considered acceptable in any °uPikiil. society, 2 is extremely sensitive
to the fact that he is a Negro. He has not said or suzgested any such
thing to Hodizgast, but this is so obvious a factsr in his correspondence
(even discounting the extent to which the correspondence is part of
his conscious cover) that it seems to Rodigas: that it must be a factor
in his life. On the other hand, kodigast has knoim another Negro who
was a close rriend of Q (and now one of his major enemies, as a result
of the Paris forged letter incident and contributing events) who was
50 sensitive about race that he makes Q in retrospect seem like an
Uncle Tom.

Still, Rodigast does not believe Q could be handled by someone
who is not genuinely a "ni-ger lover", i.e., «no could not convey
@ convincing image of a person for whom a color difference was not a
barrier (Q would surely detect the false "pal"). Q has mentioned anti-
Negro prejudice as a reason ror his refusal to cooperate with ODuNvY .
oificers who talked to him while he was in New York. In fact, Q deals.
with his present case o:ficer as e possible ii not a true friend; :
they share an intersst and involvement in writiig, English literature,
living harpily abroad, etc.; Rodigast has tried to read Dante in the
original and Q has done so; Rodigast would like to write a novel and
Q has published one; Rodigast doesn't know much about the post-logical
positivists who interest 2 but probably gives a convincing impression
that he would like to Imow about them, and just might be capable of
understandin- them. what all the foregoin~ means is that in Q we have
an accomplished person, amd it is a useful tactic to treat him if
not as a superior than at the very least as an ecual.

There remains the possibility that opportunistic reasons are
primary: Q joined the organization a-d stayed with us because he could
not do as well in eny other job, could in tact get no job (because of:
his background, his alien status abroad, ete). Rodigast does not exclude
this, although he feels that whatever the originei motivation, it has
been strengthened and perhaps converted into sonething more worthy.

But even if his primary notivation remains material, the history of the
project over its first nine months suggest it is a viable one.

re ca MOREE nals TEV eet. Pe CCE ERE 15 0 IMRT BE TN EI HHA

C. Q has lived in the underground for so meny years without
breaking that it is likely he will be able to continue to do so. lie thinks
fast, handles himselr well in matters presenting security problems.

He is not fully trained for clandestine activity. todicast's long
mestings with him always include advice on one or more speci:ic aspects
of clandestine work, which when added yp may be taken to repr=sent a
short, course, but that is all. The lac of training has led Q to do or
say things which Rodigast would not have wished him to do or say, and
whenever possible tris has been brought to Q's attention, and he seems
responsive to such instruction. .

Redigast would not recommend that Q be siven @ training course,
but this would not preclude more formal sessions with RNodigast during
which Hodigast could give more complete instruction on various phases
of clandestine work.

Q gives the imprez ion of not being easily mov:d. He has
already survived violent attacks, questi ning by legislative cocmittees '
end police (including aivord), public cenunciation; nox that he has :
KUBARA as @ friend he shouid resist at least as well es before. One
negative trait is his need to take revenge for injury, and this
tendency cust be controlled; his instinct to be spiteiul to an eneny
could conilict with a longer-range plan.

It is to te hoped that the present situation regarding his wife
(who believes him to be working for th: arch fos of /B:RIMS) will be
possible to maintain. She doesn't like the situation mich, but accepts
4t, and apparently hasn't betrayed his “confideice". If he is moved
to another city which both Q and his wife would consider agreeable
(Rome) she would-probatly be even happier ard less likely to revolt,
especially if a quarters allowance helped them get out or their present
financial straits (they can pay rent and ouy food but not save or
repay debts— so his wife sa:s he is doing an unoleasant thing without i
even being able to say they are better orf than they were in Yaris).

If he were sent to a less agreeable place for six months or a year i

(say Dar) he woulc went to settle his wife in a desirable place (London i

but preferably kome) for the children's schooling; here too her attitude i

would depend on their caterial cosition and on the possibility of “

his being able to visit on occasion (if he were in Dar, say, and she

in Rome, he would return ror visits— which would also be cover

for his meetings with his case o:ficer). Rodi gast recommends that once |

in place, Q's basic wage be raised (as promised in June 1965) from :

$600 to $800, hut that he also receive quarters and ir possible |

an educational aliowence.

D. Q says he is a local PBPRIMGR. He now does act like one.
Rodigast feels the evidence for “his loyalt~ is at least as good as
it is for most ovner PBRHIM@nS he knows. Barly in their relationship
(probably mid-June 1965 in Paris} Q had said he had turned away rrom
the revolutionary move..ent and toward his om country; even though there
were ooportunistic reasons for him to have done so, he is seeringly
not anti-PBPRUS. His views on Negro problems in Per? probably have
not changed, but he never was a black nationalist, and has many friends, 2
besides his wife, who are white). He might not agree with ODY.4: policy 5
in Vietnam, Cuba, or elsewhere-- he obviously has not been questioned {
on his personal belief=— but his dissent, if dissent there be, is !
not disloyalty, and in any case should not prevent him from executing
~~ * KUBARK policy to the letter. Undoubtedly he has a leftist economic ©
orientation, but there is no evidence that it is an orthodox Marxist fh
one (or that it ever was). fa . é
He seems to like Rodigast; in any event they work well together. :
‘ He has made no effort to develop a warm relationship with Rodigast, i
. however, appzrentiy feeling that this is not necessary, might not é
be appreciated, and would conilict with the comparimentalization so i
- : obviousiy kept in force by nodigast (who hasn't told Q his true name,
a eddress, marital status, or any other personal fact which might lead i
4 to identizying hin). Seeningly 2 does not believe the name which Rodigast
used at their introduction was a true name, for he didn't bother to {
remenber it (the last naze), and all this would tend to discourage the t
building up of a personal friendship. - . .: at j
It is probable that he respects rether than scorns KUBAAK for t
its decent treatment of him. AUBAXK through Rodigast has always kept H
its promises, dodigast has never been a minute late for a meeting (Q has Hl

rarely been a minute cc two lave, and in recent meetings—presumoly
because he feels that kodigast's never-fsiling appearance on the
precise second or the meeting mst mean that tris is recuired KUBAZK
practice— he has been even more preci:e. Hodigzest is «lvays ready
with a suggested solution to a security or other problea which will be
faced by Q in carrying out a new assignment.

On the cther hand, part of Q's satisfaction with CUBARK might
derive from a feeling that KUB\xK is a “soft touch". Rodigast does
not recomend that anything be done to change Q's opinion (if he really
does hold it); Rodigast feels th=t we are going to pay @ as much whether
he likes us or doesn't, and ior the sane money we might as well make
sure he likes us and will do his utmost ‘or the organization rather
then simply be a timeserver keeping up appearances. I: given cause
for resentment, his tehavior is unpredictable, “or he hasn't much to
Lose-—- reputation ror kyalty, good nane, etc. (ne solution would be
to give him enough so that he would indeed stand to lose much.

Q appears to possess a realitsic, sane view of ODYViG, what
its people are like, what can and can't be done by it. As already
indicated, he seezs to be as lpyal a FBPRL UR as other people xho don't
give uuch thought to the matter, certainly a lot more loyal than his
background would lead one to expect. In any case, we have no
recent evidence to contradict his statement that he considers himself
to be a loyel PBPRUL:R; it may just be true. If it isn't, this won't
make any difference to the project as it is understood by Rodizast.

Q is unlikely to hold sy.pathetic feelings for GDiVY, having
had what he deseribed as an unrortunate experi-nce or two with thea.
On the other hand, he is sophisticated enouzh to assume that his
reporting on PBPRL33 is of emcern to CD, and he mst know
that his om suggestion for tdy in PBRRLG to contact target
institations and old friends there «ould put him into ODIXVY territory.
He would probably accept any necessary collabo:ation without showing
that he didn't like it.

E. Rodigast does not believe Q is at present working for another
service, but it is difficult to know what would happen if another
service approached him. Rodigast assumes he would report this to us,
just as he reported in cetail the overtures by two persons apparently
working with the services of the country in which he resides. As part
of the present operation involves the possibility that Q will in fact
be avproached by the opposition, and Q is aware of this, one 2ssunes
he is prepared to remain loyal to KUBARK; one would also assume he would
recomize the heichtened value o: his services to us should he be
approached by the ovher side and continue to renzin loyal to us.

Q certainly would not agree to work for an opposition service
for peanuts, but if o.Zered a considerable sum of money (given that
he just breaks even in his present arrangenc..t with us, in the
thinking o2 Qts wife), there is no telling what he would do. ‘ren
recruited, @ was told he would cet a raise once he sot settled “in place”

to $806), wnen have €nou;h extra
“money to begin to pay debts and buy clothing, and thus have more
concrete evidence of the naterial advanta-es of his present arrangement.
Rodigast would be very sursrised i- Q asreed to work for an
opposition service not ior rinencial reasons out throuch ideology.
Q likes to live well. He believes in wearing good clothes,
staying in good hotels, being able to invite others out for food and

drink. He says that in the revolutionary movement poverty is no virtue,
but merely indicates lack of in:luence. He 37ys that the most popular
persons are those wno can dispense money, alcohol, and women. .his may
well be true. It is certainly true that -uch a role would please Q
immensely (that is, having a plush apartrent in whien he could entertain
terget porsonalitice, satisfying KUBARK's requirenents and his personal
desires),

FP. Q must be dealt with firmly, with continued serving of reouiremnts
and planned itineraries ior trios. At the sane time, it is obvious that
he inprovises weil when left without instructions; he is versatile,
and can create situations which wiil result in en intelligence product.
Rodigest's method is to suzgest reasonable plans and to be ready to
show that they can te implewented, and how they can, anticipating
objections.

While*there is no evidence that if left alone Q would drift,
dragging out an assignment to ‘ill time, it is possible that he would.
He has not written as many rree~iance articles as -odigast would have
liked him to, because each requires thinking out a subject, gathering
material, selecting a point of view and thinking of the public to which
it wouid be addressed--~ a lot of work for articles meant to seri: mainly
as cover, for publicetion in obscure organs, or perhaps merely to be
used to convince editors that he was active. On the other hand, he produced
the 1irst issue of the newsletter in record time. following instructions
to the letter (indeed, accesting what mist at times seem like petty
editoricel changes made by iodigast). Ferha-s he vroduced the lstter
so efficiently because he saw in it added prestice, an opportunity to
get his name back bevore the public in a respectable context.

Ideological notivation would not seem to pe a level of control
in his case. shat is most important is his contentment with being (he
hopes) a permanent part of 2 lerge organization, with a steady salary
(he has never said this, of course); ~ne power of ODY Ko is less
inportant than its known reputation cor keeping its premise to pay,
something one doesn't find anong the orpesiticn groups known to Q,
and he ‘inds new exa:ples of this daily.

Doubtless, his tendency to bear a grudze is a factor here-- Q
is now in a position where he can thumb his nose at some of his enenies.

Rodigast feels that considerate dealing with Q, letting
him know where he is zoing, what he can expect, not chenging the rules
abruptly or pullins a rug from under his feet, letting himssee the
possibility of small but certain increases in =aterial benefits in the
course of his career, compose the ideai -ormla for hendling hin.
In the course of time, the ideological factor, which is perhaps marginal
at this tine, would probably ba reinforced, could one way be a major
factor. Q, meanwhile, mist feel that the persons who deal with him
are concerned with his material wellbeing and also of his physical
safety, appre iating the risks in his work and understandinz that not
all assignzents will bear fruit. Our relationship with Q could be destroyed
very rapidly if we fail«d to pay him as promised, or wasted his time
with make-work, or cane him con-using or contredictory instructions which
suggested that KUBAXK was not the all-powerful institution he may now

\ think it is.

much the better.

H. Q is conscious of the need for secucity and handles himsels well— t
as well as an amateur could in this context. 2ut he is far more naive {
about tecrrizues and especially the nuances of tecrnique than Xodigast :

Rojigast doesn't think that even after training Q would be very
good at throwing off surveillance (for exanple) as hs seems too matter
of fact to be sly, and perhars slightly lazy ztout what sight be
gratuitous ocehavior (e.g., changing subway trains or taxis just on the
assumption that someone might be following him). Xodigest's solution
4s not to cepend on \ vor such things, but to attecpt to plan meeting
and stage other operations so as to minimize the need ‘or depender.ce
on Qts skill in such areas. After petient briefing % does understand
the need for tradecrart efficiency, and as already noted he follows
the advice.

I. At first Q qas quite concerned about money—— he needed an
advance for clothes, for travel, etc. His reauests were really plaints, -
and he nay heve left the impression that he thinks of nothing but =oney.

It would prove very useful to us--both as a contribution to the
Preparation of the Project Outline now in progress and as a backgrounder for
possible discussions of QREBONY’s operational utilization--if RODIGAS?
could provide us with an interpretive assessment of him based on the
impressions and judgements he has been able to develop over the past months.
We have same such initial assessments, of course, and can infer more from
current reporting. However, ve would like to get the benefit of RODIGAST's
unique and direct contact, now that QREBORY has passed through a breaking-in
phase and settled down in a regular relationship which, at its inception, is
certainly a difficult one for most people to adjust to. We would suggest
the folloving outline of topics for RODIGAST to follov:

A. Estimate of loyalty to ODYOKE and QREBONY's psychological
adjustment--his comfortableness--in working for ODYOKE clandestinely:
his attitude, as RODICAST can infer it, toward targets hostile to
ODYOKE: in short, his ideological motivation.

* Be Hetinate of his motivation graerally: his personal reasons for
association with KUBARK.

C. Psychological suitability and staying power in leading a “double
life". Possible or actual strains on him by virtue of his wife's attitude.
‘ Qualns about the “morality” of his position or fears about being found out.

D. His om views of his patriotism or loyalty. His attitude
tovard RODIGAST, KUBARK, ODYOKE and ODENVX.

EB. His susceptability to approach or control by an opposition service.

FP. Methods of control to which he is mort, and least, responsive.
What represents the effective lever of his control--internal ideological
