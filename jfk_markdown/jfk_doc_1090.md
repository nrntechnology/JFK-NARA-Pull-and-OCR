MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

Subject: Your Meeting with President Lopez Mateos

We do.not expect to make any major political decisions
but want to sive new emphasis to the friendly relations
which exist between Mexico and the United States. These
relations are now at an all-time high. Mexico felt it had
a veal friend in President Kennedy. they. feel the same
relationshi but b sured
warm Texas handshake and abrazo when you greet Lopez Mateos
at Los Angeles would symbolize the continuance of that
relationship,

We want to stress the identity of interests of our
countries and our ability to work out in the “spirit of
El Chamizal" any problems that may arise between us.

Despite the informal. atmosphere of the visit, we
should give serupulous attention to Mexico's extreme

sensitivity on sovereign equality and Mexico's strong
desire to avoid any appearance of subservience to the
United States.

Lopez Mateos speaks for the Mexican Government and
no important decision is made without hie approval. He

has followed an “independent” foreign policy but knows

that good relations with us, especially in the economic -
sphere, are essential to his country. At times his foreign
policy has been too independent-~for example on Cuba and in
commercial and cultural relations with Commmist China.

. MAJOR POINTS OF INTEREST TO THE UNITED STATES
po 1. General Information and Hemisphere Relations

We desire to continue close working relations with
Mexico both within and eutside the OAS and the UN.

We hope Mexico will continue to use its key political
and geographic position to help control Castro/Communism.

b '. Mexico's attention. We welcome Mexico's absistance within
if * An OAS context.

2. Red China

The coming visit of De Gaulle to Mexico and Brazil in
March has prompted speculation that these two countries
are about to recognize Red China. Lopez Mateos has given
us secret assurances, through CLA channels, that he has
no intention of recognizing Red China, We do not desire

to vaise this issue, but if Lopez Mateos ¥aises it, we
should let him know we are aware of his assurances.

3. Mexico's Role in the |

|

Mexico's participation in the Alliance is essential

to its success. Mexico has played a leading role in IA*ECOSOC
and has named the Director General of the Bank of Mexico as

| its representative to CIAP. It has cooperated with us in
providing extensive training facilities for Latin American
technicians, We want to encourage Mexico to make a greater

. eontribution. Mexieo is making renewed efforts to promote
private enterprise and we also want to encourage Mexico
along this line. We should continue te cooperate with
Mexico in maintaining financial stability and promoting
economie development.

There remain several tracts on the Rio Grande over
which sovereignty is in dispute. We desire to have the
International Boundary and Water Commiésion atudy these
problems and recommend a solution.

Mexico and the United States are cooperating in
eontrolling the importation ef narcotics and dangerous
drugs into the United States. We should strengthen this
éooperation in the mutual interest of both countries. We
hope therefore that Mexico will agree to periodic meetings
of the highest law enforcement officers of the two countries.

An appraisal report by Interior shows that this is
' the most economical way to éupply water to Tijuana. We
are preparéd to go ahéad with a feasibility study if
Mexico déesives and will share the cost.

The Mexican President wants a reaffirmation of Presi-

dent Kennedy's commitment "to reach a permanent and effect
| . ive solution at the earliest possible time" of the salinity

problem, We ean agree b / rok & nent
timing. If Lopez Mateos raises the related problem of the

Boundary Commission should study the problem. Farmers

in the lower Rie Grande Valley are seriously concerned
about saline drainage discharged into the river by Mexice
and want the Boundary Commission to achieve an early
gotution to this probiem.

The Mexiean Government is privately seriously

: disturbed about the termination of thie program. €on-
gvessional on to it is strong and we cannot commit

ge o continue the program. We are looking into the
coblem to see if anything can be done to help Mexico. One
possibility ig an expanded community development program
in Mexico through private channels (P.L.480 foodstuffs
through U. 5, voluntary agencies) if Mexico is interested.

| Mexico is concermed about United States restrictions

\ meat and other products and United States cotton policies

which it claims hurt Mexican cotton exports to the world

market. We recognize that we are natural markets for each

| other, Wé desire to expand trade, prométe competition and

develop markets, We want to maintain or expand the present

level of aceess to each other's market but we would not be
-o. suarantes Mexico its present share of our market

nodity Ox a share in increased consumption.

nizal Settlemen

Lopez Mateos wants to be recorded in history as the
man who returned the Mexican flag te the Chamizal. He
wants a ceremony at the Presidential level at El Pase-Ciudad
Juarez before December 1964 to symbolize the Chamizal settle-
ment. We should only agree to consult later in the year on
an appropriate ceremony and a possible date.
