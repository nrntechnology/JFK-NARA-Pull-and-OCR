Some 10,000 experimental biolo-

pathology, immunclory and nutrition
in mid-April when the Federation of
American Societics for Experisnental
Biolezy met in Chicago.

A last-minute chazge in speakers
was made at the General Session April

Blomedical, biological, and natural
scientists are eager to survey the scien-
tific scene. At the same time it wos
pointed out that Dr. William McElroy,
Gitector of the National Science Foun-
dation, and Dr. Philip Har:
dent of tie National A
Sciences, hzd suggested that they make
a trip jointy to China. This view was
part of the feeling in science quarters
in Washinzton that an exchange of
scientists between both countries
would be very beneficial to the two
countries even though all sorts of un-

derstandings would hive to take place. -

This was the reasoning expressed by

President Nixon's science advisor,. Dr.

Edward Davis, Jr.

Up to this point there has been-

No officiel Governme-t effozt to ~.
initiate exchanzes’ and an early 2p- ~

praisal of this possibility indicates that
funds would have to be cbtained to
finance any sizeable program. Never-

. theless, those on the scene say these
- could probably come fron founda- ©
_ tons. It is even quite possible that-
.tie White House would: push for early

passage of 2n emergency request for

funds to see that such a -scientifie-

venture sot underway. The present

Administrazion, which credits itself -

with the break-through which Ied to
the ping peng matches, is certain to
push hardsr.for a more forceful ex-

‘change now. that the door is slightly

Open, even if the Administration has
to finance an: exchange from funds
which it mght consider. of an emergen-

_& nature.

The updating of papers on Chinese

advancements has been underway ‘or

* some time. The National Academy of
Retences. neenared . shemt_ ANN, ROS ce

a en
for just such a passibility in 1968.

But the ©. papers remained undisturbed

“after it became known that an ex-

change was far in the future.

The Committee on Scholarly Com-
munications with the People’s Repub-
Ee of Ctina, a highly placed group,
has been studying the activity in-
tensely. Headed by Dr. John Lindbeck

until his secent death, this committee”

is perhaps the most knowlcdzeable of
any group 2s to just what is to be

found in China, if and when an ex- -

change takes place. Committee mem-

noted were the 30 per cent inerease in

Exhibits at the fair reflected numerous
technological advances over the pre-
vious year. Among the displays were
silicon-controllcd automatic electronic
and punch-tape-controlled tools, meas-

scopes, microscopes, and a wide range
ef synthetic plastics, resins and such
