Soviet Ofticiels' Statesents About NOSENKO

The portrait of NOSENKO which emerges from Soviet
cfficiala’ statements abunt hin since his defection coin-
cides markedly with NOSLNKO's seiti-descripston. According
to the comments cf Soviet officials, principally intelli-
gence officers most likely to be speaking authoritatively,
defector NOSENKO was the son of the deceased sfinister, he
served over a decade in the KGB, his personal shortcomings
were overcome througn tie patronage of KG3 General GRIBANOV,
and in connection witn vuperations against Americans he
occupied positions of progressively greater trust and
responsibility, ultimately becoming Deputy Chief of the
largest department in the xey Second (Counterintelligence)
Chief Directorate. According to these sources, his defection
wrought severe damage “for years to come” to tie KGB
because of his knowledge of KGB operations against American
targets, and his treaciery prompted the expulsion and
disgrace of numercus senior KGB personnel, the cecall of
many others from abroad, tne virtual suspension of KGB
operations in the United States, and extraordinary plans to
assassinate him.

These statements are related in chronological order in
Annex A.

Baku), where he finished the Eighth Class in spring, 1943.

{ ‘In a second version [more probable since entry to the Moscow
Special Naval School required prior completion of the 7:
Seventh Class] NOSENKO said that when the war broke out he
and his mother were evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he
completed the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned
to Moscow afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the
Moscow Speciai Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he
completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall os 1943
NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School (then in Baku).

After just six months in Baku, without completing the
Ninth Class, OSENKO ran away from school and returned to

Moscow. j

Comment: NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran
away and fought on the front at Tuapse, and
that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku
and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the
Frunze Higher Naval School, the cquivalent of
Annapolis. He.has retracted both assertions.

NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the
Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval 7 -
Preparatory School returned to Leningrad from Baku,.he
resumed his studies there. Early in 1945, however, NOSENKO
received a gunshot wound in the hand, and after being
hospitalized for a month, he left the Naval school.

Comment: NOSENKO has claimed both that he was shot by .
a jealous naval officer whom he then protected
‘ by stating that the wound was self-inflicted, .
and that he actually did accidently shoot him-

After NCSENKO's defection was publicized, .

NOSENKO completed the Tenth Class at the Leningrad Ship- .

Birth to 1945: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO is virtually the sole source of information on
his early life. However, this portion of his claimed
biography is consistent with the NOSENKO family's where-
abouts as publicized in press accounts at the time cf his
father's death in 1956, and with the existence of the
schools he claims to have attended.

Allowing for exaggerated claims of boyhood heroics
(fighting at the front, attending the Frunze Academy, and
formal induction in and discharge from the Navy), all of
which NOSENKO has retracted under interrogation, NOSENKO's
claimed identity as the son of Minister Ivan I. NOSENKO
and the substance of his claims about his life unti! 1945
are accepted as true. . 7 .

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute :
course was of four years' duration and that he entered the '
Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years’
duration and that Lecause he failed a state examination he
was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'
Guration and he guaduated In 1950, on schedule; and that it
was of five years' duration but he failed an examination
which delayed iis graduation for three months.

Comment: See p.3jo7? for report that NOSFNKO joined the KG
upon graduation from the Institute in 1947.
The duration of the Institute course and the
Gate of NOSLUFO's completion are material to
the plausibility of his’ claimed Naval PU service,
which: ne said followed almost immediately upoa
his departure from the Institute.

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953)

NOSENKO claims that upon completion of his studies at
the Institute of Internaticnal Relations he entered the
Naval RU, serving in the Far Fast and then in a Baltic post,
finally successfully “transferring” to the KGB through the
intervention of his father's friend, KGB General KOBULOY.

served in the RU. According tag B, NOSENKO attend8d—~ this

Information Department for about a year before securing a

respectively, as stating NOSENKD joined the- KGB in 1947
cr 1349.

THe significance of NOSENKO's BU service is the fact
that ne claims it launched his tntelligence.career and
served as the means through whi he secured appointment
to the HGR aiter once having be rejected. The two or more
years he claim q to have serveé in the RU represent a
Significant :p of. his adult life. for which he should
have ro difficulty accounting. nally, the date of his
actual transfer from the Naval to the KGB is critical to
Getermining the time from which his claims about KG3 service
ean be judged credible.

NOSENKO volunteered extensive comment on his Naval RU
service at his first meetings with CIA in 1962. After his
19€4 defection, it was the topic on which he made one of
his initial retractions and his first admission that he had
earlier made a false clain 2a subject of his Naval RU
service was consequently prominent in interrogations in
1964, 1965 and 1966. However,
challenges of nis assertions abcut his RU service prompted
adjustments in his claimed dats of graduation from the
Institute or claimed date of enery into the KGB, just as
challenges’cn those latter tepics prompted amended: state-
ments with resrect to his RU service. The extent of the
still-unreconciled discrepancies and centradictions in
NOSENKO's various accounts is best perceived in comparison
of his statements made in 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1966.

SHAKHOY "maybe" hat some contact with MARK in 1960 or 1661,
but KOSEMKO did not know the substance of it. A countcr
intelligence officer of the First Chief Directorate, S.i.
GOLUREV, hid once been on a celegation with. SHAKHOV and he
had noted "Little details". While SHAKHOV was in the vnited
States, earlier, he had been terminated fas an agent]
KGB officers who ha? submitted a report stating that SHAHHGV
liked life in the Unites States, American products,
money. in that KGB report he was Gepicted as "not gocd”
and 'nét wanting to work as an agent".

NOSENKO stated that SHAKHOV had served with the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs in the Unzted States and that Curing that
service he acted as an agent-recruiter for the KGB. XHOV
was permitted to travel abroad even though suspected ¢f being
an American agent, because he belonaed to the Ministry 3£
Foreign Affairs, and “the KGB could do nothing about his ‘
trips abroad'. “There was no proof, only suspicions, and
furthermore, SHAKHCY was a member of the personal staff of
the head of the Soviet delegation, S.K. Tsarapkin." According
to NOSENKO, SHAKHOV was not and never had been a KGB cfficer.

Comment:. SHAKHOV has served in and visited the United
. States since 1942, when he was assigned to the
Soviet Consulate General in New York. He at-
tended the 1945 Conference on International
Organization in San Francisco, and he haé at~
tended a number of sessions cf the UN General
Assembiy. Most recently SHAKHOV was assigned
to the U.S. in 1963 as a member of the Soviet
Missicn to the UN. KGB officer RASTVOROV 1éen-
tified him as an MVD [KGB] officer whom he is
certain he saw at MVD Headquarters in Moscow,

NOSENKO said that he was the sole KGB officer with the 94-
man Soviet dclegation to the Disarmament. Conference and as.
such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the
entire delegation. [KGB officers 1.S. MAYOROV and i1.S.
TSYMBAL came with the delegation to Geneva, but they had left
Geneva before NOSENKO made the foregoing statement to CIA.)
To assist him in carrying out his security functicns, NOSENKO
had the services of a number of coopted informants of the KGB
who were serving in the delegation. [NOSENKNO has never re- :
ported what, if any, security checks he ran on the delegates
in his charge, or what, if any, information his informants
provided him.]

NOSENKO has never been precise about how he spent his days
and nights in Geneva, but he has indicated that he disposed
of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had littie
to do. He explained in 1962 that he could come and go as he . -
pleased because Ambassador Zorin knew who he was, as did most
of the delegation. No one paid him any attention. It was

candidates for recruitment and came across some whos? back-
ground would have made them suitable for the Special [Illegalsi
Directorate. NOSFNKO met TSYMBAL in Moscow in the KGB Head-
quarters and TSYMBAL had asked him several times cto transfer
to the First Chief virectorate and suggested that he might be
assigned to the United States. In Geneva, he and TSYMBAL had
dinner together several times a week, sometimes accompanied
by KISLOV and sometimes alone. It was TSYMBAL's influence,
NOSENKO said, which secured NOSENKO access to the residency
in 1962 and established the precedent from which he was
granted access in 1964.

NOSENKO's Information __

SLESINGER came under suspicion by the KGB First
Chief Directorate because of his business transactions
with a number ci Soviets who visited has store and in
whom he seemed to show more chan casual interest. The
First Chief Directorate was of the opinion that
SLESINGER was trying to become closely acquainted with
some Soviets, to study them. SLESINGER had visited the

y Soviet Union several times. Learning SLESINGER planned
! “another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected that “he
< might make some contacts or do something interesting” ;

7 while visiting the Soviet Union. The KGB wanted to a
resolve 1ts suspicions’ that SLESINGER was possibly an i ;
agent or operational contact of the FBI. The KGB had
a file on SLESINGER, md a senior case officer in the
American Section of the Seventh Department, Yu. M.

DVORKIN, was the responsible case officer. An agent

of the Seventh Department who was director of a photo-
graphic shop in Moscow was instructed to become friendly
with SLESINGER while the latter was visiting the Soviet

i Union, and the two men later exchanged correspondence.

3 SLESINGER went to Odessa-to visit relatives, and DVORKIN.
directed the Odessa KGB to "surround" him with agents. who
: could watch his behavior. If there had been any indication.
of intelligence activities, the KG2 would have attempted.
: to recruit SLESINGER, but since no evidence was developed,
i no approach was made. SLESINGER had travelled to the
Soviet Union before, several times.

involved in the arrest of an American tourist in the i
USSR in the fall of 1963. Almost at once, NOSENKO d
identified the case as that of Bernard KOTEN, a guide for
Afton Tours in New York City (and hence an employee of }
Alexander SVENCHANSKIY, see above) who had heen arrested
on homosexual charges in Kiev. NOSENKO'said that KOTEN”
was involved with an American agent of the KGB Scientific

NOSRNKO's Information

SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian ex-
traction, a Russian speaker, and a university professor
in New York city. SHUBIN, who nad visited the Soviet

Union twice before, visited the Soviet Union in 1953
| or 1959, while NOSENKO was serving his first tour of
auty in the Seventh Department. At that time, SHUBIN
R was the. target of Severith Department case officer
ba A.A. VETLITSKIY, NOSENKO heard later that SHUBIN was’
i placed under surveillance, and when the KGB surveillance
: ebserved SHUBIN as a passenger in a flinistry of Dofense
automobile, the GRU was asked about the American. "They
very furtively said that they were interested in him,"
from which the KGB concluded that SHUBIN was a GRU agent.

5

£ In 1962 (sic) NOSENKO was reviewing a list of foreign
fi visitors to the Sovict Union and he noted SHUBIN's name
and recalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.
NOSENKO himself telephoned GRU General SOKOLOV's office
and informed SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according
to another version, SOKOLOV's office was advised by
others). SOKOLOV's office eventually apologized for
having failed earlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's
interest in SHUBIN’.

@ sensitive
Comment: Earlier, & ee Pcidentified a
agent apparently identical with SHUBIN ~~
and FBI sources reported SHUBIN's travel
to the USSR in summer 1961 and in
- September 1963.
SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport
between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited
the Soviet Unicn during that period it was
not as an American tourist under his true
name. Consequently, he could not then have
been the tourist target of the Seventh
Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed.
If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referriag
to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a. further
contradiction: NOSENKO could not have ae
noticed his name while reviewing tourist
lists in the Seventh Department, because
he claims he was in the American Department

Operetional Activities ~ July 1962-January 1964: Summary

To substantiate his claims to havina served as Deputy
Chief of the Seventh Lepartment during this period, NOSENKO
Gescribes MGB invelvement in the recruitment of SVMNCHANSKIY,
the arrests of KCTEN and SARGHOORN, and the investigations
Gf SLESINGER, OSWALD, and cf former KG officer CHEREPANOV,
his Giscovery that SHUBI! was a GRU agent,» and his aasignment
to Geneva. Even if NCSENNO learned cf the operations as
he Gescribed and they were as he described (there are substan-
tial reasons why they might have been cenducted by KGE
elerents other than the Seven Department), they are atypical
with respect to NOSENKO's own description of Seventh Deparc-
ment cperations. ‘They do net accurately characterize, as
NOSENNO claims, KGB counterintelligence operations against
tourists, and thus do not substantiate his Seventh Department
service. NOSENKO's explanations for his assignment to
Geneva in 1964 are no more plausible than for his earlier
assignment there in 1962, NOSENKO has asserted that he was
not a lieutenant colonel as the temporesy duty authorization
indicated, but a captain, a rank incongruous with a Deputy
Chief of Department and one from which he presumably would
have been promoted as he assumed the senior KGB positions

Immediately following his defection NOSENKO continued to

touched on nearly every aspect of NOSENKO's KGB service.

this claim. The extent NOSENKO's statements were retracted
