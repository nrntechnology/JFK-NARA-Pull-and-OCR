He then reviewed, downgraded, and rétired approximately 350 Top Secret’ docu-

conipletion of this there was not one Top Secret document on the Branch. He devised,
gained approval from Fi/D, and carried out a new procedure for the downgrading of

approximately 60 Project, 25 Subject, and fifty 201 files, He surveyed the Commu-

of him held by his previous supervisor. Conscientious, careful,
fully knowledgeable of Registry procedures he has gone abdut his
day-to-day tasks in an exceptionally proficient way without the ft
need for constant supérvision. He 1s prompt in his response to
requests and has an excellent sense of "get the job done". He
ig an intelligent and concerned supervisor who has been meticulous
in keeping his supervisors briefed on personnel and other problems
as they haye - arisen in the Station Registry. He appears fully .
capable of: assuming larger. responsibilitios. in the records field.
The rating officer regrets that Subject's family situation: pre~

Section C, oftach 0 separate sheet of paper, .
With, about nineteen months experience managing the station
‘ rogistry already under his belt, his usefulness here increases.
i Ho continues to demonstrate -the same quietly effective leadership
and talent for sound organization in his.own shop as were noted
on the last fitness report. .

While maintaining a high standard in the more routine day-
to-day services and processes a registry is normally expected to.
supply, hé has also been the catalyst for a thorough, carefully
phased and continuing review and, where appropriate, purge of
registry and other | ‘file holdings. Administer ing this ambitious
reduction program requires sound judgment and experience in
handling the detail in our existing records. Subject has these
qualities and has achieved impressive results. To complete
this task, he has asked .to extend his tour here for one yeat
until: ‘November 1971 and Headquarters has approved this.

He is invariably completely responsive ‘to guidance. from the
DCOS,. his immediate supervisor, ‘and conscientiously soeks to
achiove the work goals which are identified during our occa-
sional accomplishment and performance consultations. The
spirit of cooperation with which*he deals with other station

personnel: is equally commendable.
No criticism can be made of his security and cover deportment .

MEMORANDUM FOR; Chairman, Clandestine Service Personnel
‘ Start

SUBJECT; _Jamos 8, WOODS - Recommendation for Promotion

1, Subject has been in grade GS-10 since June 1968,
Based on his outstanding performance as Chief of Registry in
the Rome Station since June 30, 1971, he strongly merits
promotion to grade GS-11 at this time, When Subject took
over the responsibility for Registry a year ayo, he found a
system glutted with paper and bound up by a policy which
discouraged getting rid of it. He Lound many procedures in
foreo which were out of date, if not obsolcto, and proposed -

. st#eamlined procedures, which were adopted, to replace them,

He asked for and was given the responsibility to analyze and
distribute the cables, which had previously been a function
of the Chicf of Station's secrotary, He recommended. the
discontinuance of the abstract system, which proposal had
been adopted by most clements of the Station, He recommended
a reduction in the retention period for cable and dispatch
echronos., With the help of a TDY team here for the first half
of. CY 1972, he devised and instituted a progran of purging
the files, This program has resulted in the disposition of
most of the departed Soviet files, a severe trimming of the
trua name tiles, and the review, reduction and up-dating of
the project and operational tiles, All of this work w
necompanied by appropriate name cheeks, cotvies on the ludex
cards and echLion of pertinent doctmenis for transmittal to
Headquarters, In summary, Subject performed a thorough "house-
cleaning" of Station records in the full meaning of that ‘phrase,
Subject has

plans for continuing efforts along these lines "which may exceed

Jhis tenure at this Station since he intends to return to Head-

quarters not Jater than May 1974, The on-going program includes

review and reorganization of the subject files, the encrypted

201's and the disposition (hopefully) of about 50 feet of micro-
film, <A corollury to these projects will be oa significant
reduction in the index cards, which at present Jead to the micro~
‘ind to other superfluous material we either fiave or will

destroy.

2 The equally important aspect of records management,

namely the introduction of procedures to lessen the likelihood

teenie se te

-2-

if not prevent the reoccurrence of this pile-up of paper
48 not lost on this officer. He conutantly thinks in terms
of procedures and controls to accomplish this end.

3. Subject is dedicated, highly motivated, con-
scientious, and hard working. He reports to.work cach day
ap hour before the Station opens in order to distribute the
cables by opening of business, He never hesitates to respond
positively to any request for help. Indeed, he solicits

‘work which he believes can be done more easily or more simply

in his unit. In all respects, Subject is a trained, profes-
sional records managoment officer who 4s thoughtful as well’
as enthusiastic about his work,

. 4, It is strongly | recommended that Subject be pro-
noted to grado Gs-11,

FROM

SUBJECT 2 Promotion Recommendation ~
ON ee Janes S. Woods '

Chief of Station, London

-- Subject, who has been in grade as a GS-10 just two years,
has been Chief of the Registry of the London Station for eighteen
months. Subject, fresh from a Saigon assignment, brought with
him a broad axd varied background of ficld experience (Far East)
and several He2dquarters' assignments. He has been in one or
another as pe ef records management work since he started with

us as a very junior clerk in 1952,

- Subject’ 6S fitness reports, since -he has been in London,
testify to the Nigh regard in which he is held by the Station
and the excelient results he has managed to achieve. When he
arrived at the Station, the start had been made on a file reduction
program but 2m enormous amount of organized work remained to be
done, Subject set about it with great enthusiasm and a high degree
of professiosz2 organization. As a result, the Registry inventory
today is the feanest and the most efficient the Station has scen
for many a long day, if ever before. To a great extent this can
he lnid at Subject's own door and he personally did much of the
work. At th we time, Subject surveyed and reorganized the over-
all workivad oi the Registry and was finally able to recommend to
the Siat nent a reduetion of one Ren tisatey elerk. The
spribler si certainiy required a more iatensive work uelfert
on the part of istry personnel, which has been attained without
any loss of morale; in fact, quite the reverse, -

Subject, therefore, emerges as a records management officer
who has thorougsly learned his business and a hard-driving,
sympathetic and successful supervisor, In the opinion of the
Station management, Subject is already quite capable of taking
over broader more scuior responsibilities in the records manage-
ment field, in this respect, however, we do not believe he will.
be wastiag nis time in London by spending, as he currently plans ‘to
do, an additional year here on the completion of his tour in -
November. The London Registry, reflecting the multi-faceted work
of the Station, is sufficiently complex an operation to warrant

14-00000

Subject's continued attention,

In view of his really excellent performance and high promise, t
it 1s strongly recommended that Subject be promoted to GS-11.

"C. In addition to his normal duties, Mr. Woods is constantly
thinking of ways to increase the efficiency of the Station Kegistry,
and to be of greater assistance to the Station as a whole, Several of
his ideas have been adopted by the Station with a resulting increase
in effectiveness. His positive approach to all problems and his
cheerfulness and willingness to perform any task have benefited
both the Station and the Agency.

"D,. In view of Mr, Woods! demonstrated. ability to provide
leadership to the Station Registry unit, his positive approach to
the solution of the many problems which daily besct this unit,
it is strongly recommended that he be promoted from GS-09 to
GS-10 at the earliest, opportunity. :

4.) Mr. Woods has contititiod to perform, in-an over-all "Strong'™
Taamnéer as indicated in his Fecent fitness report. He recently planned |

‘aiid ‘effectively “implemented the move of the Cable Secretariat from one

ioeation to ahother. Ina dispatch, dated 22 November 1965, the present
Chief of Station, Tokyo, stated, "There is little [can add to my prede-
cessorts Fecommendation, dated 9 November 1964, for promotion of

“Mr, Woods, ‘He is performing his duties as Chief of the Tokyo Station

Registry with efficiency and dispatch. He is a strong supervisor who
constantly strives to achieve the maximum economy in the use of his
personnel and materials,"

§. Consideration haa been given to the granting of an Honor and
Merit Award to Mr, Woods, but | in this particular case it appears that
a Quality Step Incréa'se is more appropriate,
