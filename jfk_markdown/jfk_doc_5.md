“As ged ubese of €/SR and the DOP, I met «ith Mr. W.

David Slawson of the staff of the President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy at 1406 hours on this date in

the Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington,

D.C. The purpsse of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies

in material provided the Commission by CIA and ty the Department of

State which were calicd to our attention in a letter from the General

Counsel of the Cummission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.

2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the! -
Commission's report that he was writing, he sould have to deal with the :
question of whett.er or not the OSWALDs! depzrture {rom the USSR - and
the circumstances {i.e. timing) of that departsre - were unusual or ,

suspicious in any way. He expressed his belie/ that they probably were
not and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters jn the post-Stalin era.
However, he war.ted to be sure in his own mirg that our information was
not in conflict with that which the Commission had received from State’
since all of that information would remain in the records of the

Commission.

3. After stating my belief that. there was no real disagreement or
inconsistency between the information from CLA and that from State, I
expressed the view that the matter resolved itseif into three questiozs:

for FOIA Review on JUN 976 . estoy.

jak. os Spee ee A
13-00000

a. Dothe Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet
“citizens married tu forcign nationals to emigrate from the
Sovict Union to the homelands of their spouses? .

b. | Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to
accompany (i.e. depart simultaneously with) their spouses
from the Soviet Union?

c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get
Soviet exit visas ior such a purpose (time lapse from application
to granting of visas)? ; :

4. Concerning the first two questions (3a and 3b above) I pointed out .
_._that we had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Soviet citizens
being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only
with the larger question of Sovicts married to foreigners being atiowed
to emigrate without reference to whether or not they left simultas:cously

with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson cormmented
that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and

State had said in that light.

S. By way ér further explanation, I said that the statements in
paragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being
permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based ona
review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. . In only four of
these cases did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of rer foreign
husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the
remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit us to
categorize them. I added that although State's information began by
citing the issuance of ‘724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the
American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December
1963, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens
who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed
information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of these
whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.

/6, In response to
13-00000

4
6. In response ty a question from Mr. Slawsoa I stated that most

of the'26 cases upon which we based Gur statements involved foreign

’ students, exchange teachers and other relatively transient persons,

_ and while a number of cases have certain points in common, they bear
‘little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none imvolved a defector who -
‘married prior to rcpatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April

1964 memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson

indicated that hg was now satisfied on this matter.

8 7. ‘Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to

process exit visas for Savict citizens married to foreign nationals
(question 3c above), I stated that, in my vpinion, the information
provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter)
substantially corresponded to the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7
of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson
asked if it would be pussible to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum
of 6 April by providing 2 statistical breakdown of the cases on which our
statements were based. I indicated that this coald be done.

8. At this point Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion
he felt that the question of possible inconsistencies had been resolved.
However, he asked that «e send a brief written reply to the Commission's
letter of 3 July 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning
the basis for staternentz included in our 6 April 196¢ memorandum. [This
would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed
to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet

visa applications. ]

9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report
dealing with the Sovict intelligence services to CIA for checking as to
their accuracy. ‘He did not say when this would occar.

10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Slawson, I yead Volume 52
of the transcript of testimony before the Commission. s included the
reinterview of Marina OSWALD. .

; . sp og

“are-- og

response to question. #3 of your. memorandum of 12 March 1964 entitled:

y Questions Posed by State Department Files. ‘ That question read as follows:
“At the time that L.H. OSWALD and M. OSWALD lef ~

Russia for the United States wae it legal and normal under Soviet law
and practice for a Rusaian national married to an American to ve able

to accompany him back to his honieland? Was the vapidity «fh which

L. H: OSWALD was able to accomplieh this and Marina's retuxnin

any way unusual? “*

2. Our reply addressed iteclf to the legality and normality of Soviet

cltdizens accompa nying ies: departing simultaneously with) foreiga spouses

out of the USSR. It wae baaed ona review of 26 cases, of which 16 imvolved

Americans, in which foreign nationals married Soviet citizens im the USSR.

In oaly four of these 26 cases, did the Soviet wife leave the Soviet Usion in the
Dot . '

company of her hueband. In one of these four cases, an Italiae Communist

/ Party member married
13-00000

Party member married in the USSR and by prevatling upon the Hialiea Embaasy
to hold up Italfan vieas for Soviet seamen, was able to arrange for hie wife to
accompany him to Italy. In two more of the cases, an American met his
future wife on a vieit to the USSR, married her on'a subsequent trip, and -

brought her back to the U.S. No detalis are available on the fourth case,

which involved a Swedish student who married a Soviet student and apparently

drought her out with him.

: 3. In 14 of the remaining eases, a foreign husband (in one case a wife)
i
departed alone, In another case the wife preceded her huokand because he
had been failed a month or two previously for violation of travel regulations

and in 7 additional cases the sequence Is not known.

4. The information in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter

regarding length of time taken by Soviet authorities to process visa applications

of Soviet wives of American citizens substantially corresponds with the

conciusions which we expressed in paragraph 7 of our tnemorandum of

data

6 April 1964. The material from Mr, Meeker provides useful additional
