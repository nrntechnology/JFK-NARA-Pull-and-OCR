4, ‘The. cover story to be used by Agent. ge during
the installation is that he is working on thé housé at the _
easor Washington real estate agent, Mr./ (ee

a2! > Mr. / SSR) supposedly maintains
“the house for a New York lawyer in‘ordér to billet the latter's
transient clients. Case Officer MATT has engaged a maid to
clean up the house Mondays and Thursdays; however, she can be
told to stay away if Agent/GREMSEER needs to do work there on
those days. It was also discreetly requested. by the undersigned
of Case Officer MATT not to kibbitz too mich while the techni-
cians are making the installation.

5. It is expected that the audio results of this type
of coverage will be superior to the results of the previous
"radio" phase. The only complication will be: in servicing the

recorders on.a timely basis. a“.
