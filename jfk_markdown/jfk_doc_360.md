ADHINLSTHATIVE
Mandling of a Sovict Defecter

NO_INDOUNG REQUIRED

1. 1 suggest that the story of ASLADLE, fram the aonent he walked into the
home: of Martin A. KOODINE untis be uss safely under alisha custody in tne Laited
States, deserves compiling, analysis, 6Ad publication in the fors of an Gperae.

mounted, and could be nighiy instructive to Cuierfs uf Station ia all camtries

“2. Here is the Frankfurt contribution (written at ay request) to such @
Compilation: a cliffhanger from atart to fialan, but also eo svomentary on tne
mary types of probleas which can arise, and tne fect tiat..2t taxes hard scrk-aod --
@kil1ful Laprovisation to salve thes. 1t wae a cliffnanger botn before and after
the Frenkfurt chapter (1 nominate MOUDIMNE for @ modal for his part) and ougnt to
eake excellent reading.

estanliancent of bona fides, dodriefing, and resettiasont of defectors hes exiatod
here for the last decade, Sor is the auvenant by. blacn.cracuation-of-cperational= -
personnel a unique task for us t: perform. We have @cuunpiiehed this many tines
by use of cur.ow, intograted WUNIT facility and also by the furnicning of alias
Gcoumentation to the person of interest and A@cconplisning the transport via
acheduled MATS flights. The aimificont points which aade tne ARLADLE case unique .
@Ay never again in their entirety be duplicated but in part they eny well be,
and therefore should bo cnumerated: .

: a. A Soviet diplomt, and nember of the KIS, stationed in a none
_ Satellite but politically senaitive country, whien at the tine cs ABLADIE's
Gofeotion was wider conaiderable Soviet pressure. :

b. The fact that the actual atroumtanses uoncermins hic -:t of
‘defection were such thst an imedicts desigion by tha am on tue acens nad
to bo made to take advantage of the opportunity.

©. The fact that little alterzative could be given, under the facts
as described in (a) above, except to believe the defeator's statements
Gnd ooquiesce in his demmnda, i.o., he possessed information of a significant
and perishable nature and vould disvlose it conpletsly only upoa arrival in

a. Tne fact that ance the commitments in (c) above wore wade every
weasonnble effort hed to be made to acocumodate the defector'’s demand.

; ©. in order to accomplish all this an untried method of evacuation, £
black evacuation via coameroial aircraft had to be accomplished in order to
wuocessfully procead with the undertaking, , :

4. A retrospective analysis as to how this care commenced, and the unique
" feeters connected with it as cnussrated above, lead ee to suggest for Headquarters
otudy- what I refer to as “!indings” snd “areas of study,” Ghat 1 have leteles as
“rindings® in effect reprerent facts uhich, Lf mot aru Git, yuite probably sould
have deprived us in durmany of particlpeting Swessstully in the sovement of the
ARLADIS family, The “areas of atudy,” on the other hand, repreaent either anseere
able questions or matters in areas wneroin operational disgussions may well take
place to noo if same tyne of achool-buok solution can be devised. .

in Germany and a cleared and witting contact, as to whether or not he
ould arrange to board Passengers without going through German

was also involved. LAPOLLA Suggested that we phone Naylor in his

Setion for several reasons. We antioipated that there would be too
tuch conversation Smong the single military personnel aboard the flignt
when they observed five civilians, three of whom were obviously a
‘family, flyirg on the sano Plane. The fact that the six-year-old
daughter spoke no English also contributed to the adverse situaticn we
anticipated. Secondly, subject and family had already been aboard one

Rhein/Main, both of wnom are United States citizens, and asked that

they proceed to the airport and stand by to assist him in tne handling

of sowe very important personages ic wore departing on PAA No. 73,

He then ascertained that only three first class seats were available -

om this flight. He told his assistant to soat two passengers in the ©

@ircraft lounge and he would accept full responsioility for it. This

1o somewhat touchy in the airlines business as lounge seats have no .

, West reading we could get froa the KURIOT people working.on the dooue.

wents was that they would not be ready on time. Inasmuch as decisions
bad been made, we decided tc set the wheels in motica and started the

. Gid not look ag if we would have any useble documentation to pass. the
fanily and would have to take ti:o chance of wircurenting the Passport

Control. Our principal concern was that a Geruan Innigration Officer

would be standing by the aircraft departure area and ould ask to see

subject's passport. Wo could not Ret subject's family aboard the

2 Fegular bus that gees Zrom ine deparvure building to the afroraft

Without going thro:.zh Pasaport Contrel, EANTHAT esked how we evaluated

an ability to withdraw gracefully at plane side if chalienged by German

authorities. I told him the chances were better than even and that we
would appeal to the fact that this. was a VIP party being handled out of
the regular airport procedures and that tne passports had been left in
the PAA -ffice. he would then put the party back in tne vehicle tnat’
took them out and Just keep going. BENTHAM authorized us to proceed
with the “black” evacuation. : .

party was drawing up. The group wes then taken by a clroultous route
Ro the PAA Operations Cffice.. It-was cscertained that PAA No. 73 would:
arrive at 1245 hours, approximately thirty minutes late.

26. During our weit at the PAA Operations Office, ROGDIME got me
@eide three or four times and kept me continuously aware of subject's
fear that an attempt tould be made to sabotage his plane, “ead
@videnced this concern ever since his arrival in Frankfurt. Subject
told KOODINE he felt sure that Soviet agents would be found agong some
of the employees of the commercial airlines and the managesent of Knein/.
Wain Airport. He mentioned the section of the KIS that works specifically
OA assassinations and sabotage. He was fearful of. any: baggage being _
loaded very late or any "spare baggage” that might be fSund aboard: the
@iroreft. I told ROGDINE we were very sympathetic but we were not about
to ask Naylor, who had now gone much further than one could be reasonably
expected to on our behalf, to off-load the baggage of 184 passengers
and search it. oe

27. Two events happened while we were waiting in the offies to
beari the parties that were of some disturbance. The airplane Captain
reported to the PAA Operations Officer that a gun was found aboard: the
Plane. Upon investigation it.was determined that this gun belonged to
an Armed Forces sourier who had oarridd classified material on the aire
ermett to Frenkfurt. The cirpians captain, upon being asked ay Naylor
