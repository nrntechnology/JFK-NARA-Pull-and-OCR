Target Analysie Summary Report . AMMUG/1 Operation

SUBJECT: Roque DALTON Garcia

I. Significance of Target

DALTON is a recruited agent of the Cuban PGI. He has been
trained in guerrilla warfare, 8/v, radio transmission,
and radio reception. AMMUG/1 claims that Subject is a
menber of the Central Committee of the PCES. AMMUG/L
, characterized Subject as having excellent contacts within
. the DGI in Cuba. Subject is in contact with Mauricio
. de la Selva Venegas, the Salvadoran intermediary, in
Wexico City. In view of the above, Subject could be
expected to furnish considerable information on both the
PCES in Bl Salvador and his activities for the DGI.

Il. Current Location

Subject was deported fron £l Salvador to Mexico in late
January 1964. On 16 June 1964 Subject was spotted by the
Salvadoran National Police in San Salvador, and is now
under surveillance. Exact address will be obtained by

the San Salvadoran Station. ‘

TIX, Vulnerabilities

AMMUG/1 lists Subject as his lending candidate for recruit=
ment by us. His reasoning on this 1s that Subject is not

: highly motivated, has a weakness for women and the easy
life, and a generally weak nature. AMWUG/1 says that
Subject is very intelligent, but never showod a real desire
to learn during bis Cuban training. Subject was given
600 dollars to purchase a radio receiver upon his return
from Cuba, but he apparently spent the soney on himself.

IV. Faully and Relatives

Pather (deceased) waa U.S. citizen. One of Subject’s three
brothers fought for tse U.S. in Okinawa. A sister,
Margarita, ia Mexican citizen who now is in Cubaas a

student.

or pefection 7 yy
—_— 6-2 oz i

Subject is nnovt Personally by AMICG-1' and by (JOBRIN-2,
recently (recruited agent) of\San Salvador Station Subject .
is presently under surveillance by tho National Police

in San Salvador (Station has(mnilaterai penetration of ey

the policeywho might be used ag a lead into Subject).

VII. Evaluation

From ANMUG-l's assessment of Subject, based on personal
knowledge and observation, it would appear that Subject
would not be a too difficult target to hit. However,

some of his personal characteristics which have made hin
a handling problem for the DCI vould presumably meke him
a handling probles for us. His failure to perform for
the DGI since October 1963 might mitigate against our

use of him which would incluce, presumably, resuaption of
his s/w channel. Nonetheless, AMMUG-1‘'s clain that Subject
is a meber of the Central Comittee of the PCES (nevs to
us) makes him an operstional target for that reason alone.

MOTE:

written by Madariaga (GUFRRERO’s pavedo) atteapts to
point out reasons for its failure. fnother doazent
written by Silvio Hayorgs and Orlando Cuant blenes
“andres” (GURRRESO) for its fnilure. GLZERHINO, Lowever,
must still be in the good graces of the Cuban 18, if
he is an ayent in the “Hijos de la Texpestad” and
gerves 435 “intermediary” to the FLX, or remnants which
may be reorganizirg. It seens highly enlizely that
GURRRERO would be receptive to either recruitment or
defection. AMWUG~1 knows him personally end met with
his in Kexico in Herch 1964. It would appesr that
AMNUC=1 could furnish more information about his
eostact sith GUEHTERO which woulc be helpful in an
assezsnent of GUEIUKZO.

There is a report thet GUERRERO was io Nicarapus
ciandeatinely in 1962. He waoule undoubtecly be
arrested should be return there and ois presence
discoverec by the Aicaraguans.
