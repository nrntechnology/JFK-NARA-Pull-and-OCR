‘MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Ramparts:. John Garrett UNDERHILL Jrt,
: Samuel George CUMMINGS, and

INTERARMCO —

1. Ramparts of June 1967, Vol. 5, No. 12, pp- 28-29, contains:
the following passages about Subjects: eo

_. "The day after the assassination, Gary Unde rhill left
Washington in a hurry. Late in the evening he: showed up
at the home of friends in New Jersey. .He was very agitated.
A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the as~
sassination, he confided, and he was afraid for his life and
probably would have to leave the country. Less than six

_. months later Underhill was found shot to death in his

~ .Washington apartment. The coroner ruled it suicide.

"J, Garrett Underhill had been an intelligence agent
during World War Ii and was a ¥ecognized authority on limi-
ted warfare and small arms. A resea rcher and writer on
military affairs, he was ona first -name basis with many of

“the top brass in the Pentagon. He was also on intimate terms
with a number of high-ranking CIA officials--he was one of

" the Agency's ‘un-people' who perform special assignments.
At one time he had been a friend of Samuel Cummings of
Intérarmco, the arms broker that numbers among its cus-
‘tomers the CIA and, ironically, Klein's Sporting Goods of
Chicago, from whence fsic/ the mail-order Carcano alleg-.
edly was purchased by Oswald. °

“The friends whom Underhill visited say he was sober
but badly shook. They say he attributed the Kennedy
murder to a CLA clique which was carrying on a lucrative
racket in gun-running, narcotics and other contraband,

_and manipulating political intrigue to serve its own ends.
Kennedy supposedly got wind that soniething was going oa
and was killed beforé he could "blow the whistle on it’.
‘Although the friends had always known Underhill to be
.. \petfectly rationaland objective, they at first didn't take
‘his account seriously. ‘I think the main reason was,"
‘explains the husband, “that we couldn't believe that the
. CIA could contain a corrupt element every bit as ruth-
* lesé--and more efficient--as the mafia.*

"Phe verdict of suicide in Underhill's death is by no
* means convincing. His body was found by a writing
:. collaborator, Asher Brynes of the New Republic. He .
chad been shot behind the left car, and an automatic pistol
- was under his left side. Odd, says Brynes, because
Underhill was right-handed, Brynes thinks the pistol
was fitted with a‘silencer, and occupants of the apartment
building couid not recall hearing a shot. Underhill obvi-
ously had been dead several days.

. “Garry Underhill's chilling story is hardly implausible. :
_As a spy apparatus the CIA is honeycombed with sel{-
contained cliques operating without any real central control... Pad
