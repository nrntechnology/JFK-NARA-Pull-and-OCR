[Be Moore bas. just returned frow Viet Naa where be partici-

pated in the combat operations of the American Special Forces iu Viet Naa. after
he bad gone throush about eight munths of, training al the special Forces xchook

at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Sone understandin: ef Moore's personali
ontained frou reading au interview between bin and the mazazine U. =
World Report. which was published recently. and copy of which was lef‘ with
Varia, Further understandings aod irpressionz of Moore may te obtained from -
reading his previously published twok about Jack Youngblood. an American who
participated in the events leading to Castro's overthrow of Hattista.

b. In my opinion. Moore has a burning desire to be known |
as a tough, two-fisted, rip roarins soldier of fortune. He has participated
in real war in Viet Nai, and has received what is probably the best traiuing
in the world for guerilla fighters. namely. the C. &. Special Forces. Tais

includes training as a parachutist. ife is inclined to bray. and is probably .

inclined to interperate use of alcobul and wucen. and his judzenent of in-

- portant matters is probably immature. However. he definitely understands
and is experienced iu wuerilla fizhtiug, is experienced in military operations,

and rust surely understand military security.

c. He is definitely willing to help, but cannot contribute

cash directly; is willing to furnish the use of the cuest house on his property
for linited periods of time. Is willing to participate and aid in an operation

to land people on the sczth. coast of Cuba, tut is not willing to comit the ue
of his Property and facilities as a stagiug area for resupply in the future.

. d. Is willing to coue to Miasi, for conferences if bis
expenses are paid. - .

2. Site Evaluation

a. Blue Hole is an , excel lent bartor; protected avainst
all weather. and with six feet of waier at ine bar. Is surrounded by very
steep slopes, heavily wooded. Dock facilities are presently very meager,
but could be quickly and easily improved. \o fuel for a boat is avaiiabie .
at Blue Hole, and at Fort Antonio (ihe closest source). the fuel available .
is diese} fuel or autonotive gasoline; no marine white gasoline is available
auywhere ia the area. This is a nost significant factor in selecting a
suitable boat. —

b. The nearest source of food aud other supplies is Port
Autonio; Fred Barrett. manager of the Blue Lazoon Club. orders and hauls
supplies from Port Antovio constantly, aud could deliver whatever supplies
were desired. Firearms and explosives are not obtainable on the island.
They would have to be smuggled in illegally.

ce. A small station wagon is available for transportation,’
provided expenses are paid by users. :

3. Miscellaueous, Inforwatiou °

a. “A local can. George Munroe. is reported to be a very .
experienced small buat captain und one who has Urought boats down frum Miant

b. The S.S. Frangeline sails every two weeks fros “iaai i
direct to Port Antonio, and could be employed for the delivery of supplies and
even a toat to Hobin Moore.

c. Fred Barreti, manager of the bar-restaur‘nt. seera to i
woe be a verry capable wan. and for an additional 210 per week added to his regular
pay. would be quite willing to assist any operation, i

d. A‘Mr. Anihony Gason. a retired Britisi aray colonel, !

is the Jamaica representative 1 TROJAN boats, at a place called Turtle Cove, :

between Port Antonio and Blue dole. :

e. The immigration chief for Jaczica is a man ty the name:
of George Eubcuks. who is the forner chief of police at Port Antonio: Moore +
claims that they are very close personal friends.

d. Moore is acquainted with a ran by the name of Mike Hedges,
who is a nephew of Burke Hedges. the -\cerican who becars Cuba's actassador to
t Chile some years ago. ‘ike lives in Kingsiony and, if he is not a Sattista
: ae sympathizer. might prove to be a very valuable connection. The fazily is re-:
ported to be quite wealthy, and would establish an excellent cover. :

4. Operational Considerations : i

: a. In order to avoid the use of simnificent naes. I
Sustracited Moore to refer to Vanolo as George hinz. and the operatios of
landing him in Cuba would be referred to as Operatiouhiug, The cest likely
acheme seems to be to establish a suitable boat al Biue Hole, sith ike cover |
story to be that it belongs to \serican frieuds of Robin Moore. Hous~z is ~
available locally for a limited camber of Cutans, with “Moore being able to
accommodate up to six on his on property. The local boat captain. Leorge
Muuroe. could be employed as captain initially. to. train the Cuban crew in
the local warine conditions, as well as serving a5 at effectite sever. In >
ny opinion. it will rot be too difficult for persons to enter Jamaica without
difficulty, provided they know a certain ninizum amount of English. 3

we

I think a suitable locatizn could te found for redio .!
transnission and reception facilities on the nills surrounding Blue ‘ols. but —
this would have to be examined by someone skilled in radio techniques. Yateo
would be excellent. . . j

. ; In summary, I would say that Robin Moore aud his property ana!

' . buildinzs at Blue Hole would servé as an excellent tase of operatious. but that
: the boat necessary for the operation wuld have to be acquired and equipped

in the states and shipped down there, except for the renote pussiblility that;
a suitable boat could be found in Kinston. I think a headquarters could be;
established at small cost through Nwore's good offices, and IT think that Rud;
would te a good choice to coordinate the initial operations there. 3
