2. We have been in recent contact with Edward ScannelV Butler, Executive
Vice President and Staff Director, and have received his assurances of. whole-
hearted cooperation in our agency's mission. [¥esterday we examined all of | the
files ‘of correspondence between Hr. Butler and personne! of various radio-

tations in 16 Latin American count ries.| tn order to build up a market for

the Truth Tapes program in Latin America, Mr. Butler first obtained from the
appropriate consul in New Orleans a list of the radio stations in operation in
his country. He next wrote the administrative personnel of these stations
about the anti-Communist purpose of INCA and offered to supply each station
with Truth Tapes. Those stations requesting them were then provided with a
series of the tapes. One or two years later, Mr. Sutter sent the participating
station a questionnaire designed to elicit information. about audience response
to the Truth Tapes program. Copies of the first questionnaire and of a revised
one are attached for your information. Judging by the responses we read, the
{NCA correspondence files will provide a limited amount of information; dated
i304 aad 1555, an the identification of radio stations in Latin America which
are broadcasting Truth Tapes, their addresses, the names of key personnel, the
identification of stations not responding to the INCA offer, sizes of audiences,
and their responses. Ja the case gf Uruguay, the exchange of correspondence
between!Nr, Gutter and for. Martin Mi queo-Narancio pontained information about
the political orientation OF 8S > personnel “tn Montevideo /HO-TOO7E/.

foned yesterday that, tna
Id wetecoae r ppestions avout addittonsal topics.
C stions designed to elicié technical information about ‘the station
and its equipment, such as descriptions (manufacturer, type, model) of trans~
mitter, receiver, antenna type and power, frequencies and frequency range, reli-
ability of cquipment, normal and emeryencsy power sources, remote pick-up arrange-
ments, etc. We stressed of course that none of these topics should be introduced
into the questionnaire unless Mr. Butler was convinced of their suitability for
his immediate purpose as well as for the long~tern propaganda alm of his organi-
zation. He stated that our su3gestions were entireiy proser and, in his opinion,
were reasonable requests that would not arouse the station manager's curiosity.
We pointed out to Mr. Butler that, while Information fabout key personnel and —
their political orientation,) about the station's adainistrative policies, etc.,
was of prime importance tous, these subjects obviously could not be introduced
‘into the questfonnaire. He agreed that it would be better to elicit such infor~
mation in another manner, as he had done with(Dr. Miqueo-Narancio,Pbut because
of his very heavy responsibilities, he did not Rava time-to-devefop similar
‘sources of information in each of the other 15 countries.

4, tt occurs to us that you or a possible consumer could assist us by
; suggesting other appropriate topics for Mr. Butler's consideration in the revision
wt of the questionnaire. We shall appreciate whatever help you can glve us In this
regard.

5. tn the meantime, as soon as all of Mr. Butler's current correspondence
been properly filed, we expect ta extract the appropriate information froma

hes
the folders and to present the material in a series of 00-B reports
