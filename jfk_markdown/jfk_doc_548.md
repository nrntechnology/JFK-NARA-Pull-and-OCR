MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with AMBUNNY-1 (291-775391) and
AMWHIP-1 (201-267966)

DATE: 25 May 1965, 1900-2039 hours
PLACE: Office of AMWHIP=1, 31 W. 47th St., New York, ‘N.Y.
i

PRESENT: AMBUNNY-1, AMWHIP-1, and DAMICONE using alias of
Al MARIN .

'
| 1. I had introduced AMPUNNY-1 and AMWHIP-1 to each other '
24 May but the office was crowded, so there was very little :
| Opportunity to discuss operational matters. We met again
i on the above date, after business hours, and we were able
| to meet in private. Although AMWHIP told me that he was
Hl delighted with AMBUNNY-1 herself, as he said the ‘Cubans
| like that kind of girl -~ not too fancy", he thought that
‘= her background ~— particularly her previously working for the
| 9 (u.s. Ambassador in Bolivia.)would aake the operation very
: | risky. He said that itfit were discovered that ANPUNNY-~1l was
i a penctration of the NAFU~19 office (by the Cubars} his
connection with ODYOKE would the e revealed, with the result
that all bis “connections” withQNSNAFU-19, and “Habana” would
be lost. AMWHIP-1 opined that he thought 1t likely that ‘the
| Cubans would check ber out in livia) ;

2. AMWHIP suggested the? ssibllity of using a cutout
to introduce AMBUNNY-1l to the (UNBNAFU-19 iostallation. He
said he would explain in detail at a later time, what he
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any more than necessary

to AMBUKNY-1.

3. Also, AMWHIP~2 stated that he was unable to travel
to Paris before midwJune, as he nad sowe relatives coming
to visit him from Italy. After checking with DI UBALDO,

I subsequently informed AMWHIP-1 and AMBUNNY-1 that the
(5-4 (aris operation was off. Both expressed relief. I told
AMDUNNY-1 that she could most likely still be utilized in
\2-2 (RabaQ, and that we would discuss the possibilities ata -
ater date.
