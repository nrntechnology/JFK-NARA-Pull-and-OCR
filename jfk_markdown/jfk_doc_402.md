After the war, Dr. Matperin worked with the United Nations
for a counie of years and then joined the faculty of Boston
University where ha was involved in the establishment ofan
interdiscipinary department of Latin American stucies. a

During this period he visited Brazil twice, lecturing at the
University of Sao Paulo and’ serving as a consultant to the
state government of Sao'Paulo. After his second visit, he was

decorated by the Brazilan government with the Order of tha

“My stay at Boston coincided with the most intense petiod

my job.

“Among other disagreeable aspects of ¢0-operating, it
wou'd have turned me into an informer against peopte who,
@s far as L know, had committed no crime, {Just couldn't think
of fecing my stucents with their knowledge that I was an

informer.” :

Leaving Boston University, ho went to the National Unk .

versity of Mexico City where he remained-for six years. While
working there, ho did some'consulting work for the Mexican

Government, thereby gaining turher practical experience |

on the probiems of undercevelopment in Latin America.

This experience ted directly to his next Gosition — athree- |
‘ar appointment at the Academy of Sciences in Moscow. -

Halperin oxpiains:

” “At that time, the period when Kruschev was trying to -

foosen up somo of the rigid controis of Stalin's Gictatorship,

(hore was a desire at the Académy to have some western |
expcrtiso on Latin American., devetopmentat Problems. in -
other words, my Mexican experience was a direct prerequie :

gile for tha Moscow Invitation.

“It's strange ‘how, in retrospect, what Seemed to be a

rather ditticutt choice in 1953 tumed out to be very iucky.
You never know. Something happens that can crush you or,
on the contrary, -can make you heahier ang
than you've everbeentefore, ee

“And, when the invitation came frei, Moscow, | was foots
foose end free. My Status in Mes was always that of a
visiting professor, so had no prov... of secunly — tenure
or pension, lor oxamp'e — to tie rr
had nothing to fose and everything to gan.”

Dr. Hatpurin spent threo yec's at tne Academy and found
ft to bo en extraordinary expenecnce. “| wasn't there as a
tourist; neither was I.there as an outside researcher. L was,
cctualty in the machine, with no permanent ties to it. was
working in tho factory, rather than just studying it.”

__AS ithappened, Or, Hatperin wes interestec. He scent
fMext six years in Cuba, and alter lesving, procuced:a book

Essay in Contemporary History. it was pudtsned dy tne Unie -
versity of California Press and a second eciton, im paper:
“beck, has recently eppeared. {Incidentaty, Cr. Hztoern's
Published work spans 45 years and “several thousand
pages.")
“Aa with tho Moscow appointment, it was the fet that he :
” was freed of concemns about Job secunty, since he Pau none,
which allowed:him to accept Guevara's offer. .
Alnough Cuba was “Aa very pleasant country,” Or, Hak

Salt of a ladiespoon of cooking oil and there we were, siting ~

And a turther quirk of fate, naturally, brought him to Simon
Fraser in 1968..He'd met a Canedian while in Navara and one

‘dey, soul e yea" later, ha received agnane cal “tromaniace

called Burnaby.” It was the samo Canadian, imag tum to

Participate in a seminer on Latin America, with “al expenses

._ When ho received the invitation, in the spring of 1$68, he
had already resigned his position in Havenaarc was gionning
to return to the United States the. foilowng Sestember,
