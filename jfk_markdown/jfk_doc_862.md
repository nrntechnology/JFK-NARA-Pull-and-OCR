IDENTIFIED (DECLASSIFIED) RECORDS WILL_BE HOUSED IN THE NATIONAL
ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION. HAS HAD SOME DEALINGS
WITH THE ARRB, BEGINNING WITH THEIR REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO THE
RESTRICTED Wes ih STAT TONS HISTORY FROM THE 1960'S. THE ARRB’'S

*DOCUMENTS ONLY MOST TANGENTIALLY RELATED TO THE<KENNEDY>
*<ASSASSINATION. »

*IN MINSK, WERE FLOWN TO MOSCOW IN ‘63 FOLLOWING THE<ASSASSINATION, >

THEN RETURNED TO MINSK WHERE THEY ARE STORED TODAY. WHEN

APPROACHED BY STATE AND THE ARRB, THE BELARUSIANS HAVE SHOWN

SAMPLES FROM THE FILE BUT HAVE NOT AGREED TO ARRANGEMENTS TO COPY.

THE ARRB CHARTER EXPIRES ON 30 SEPT 98 AND THE OLD KGB FILE(S) IS

A MAJOR OUTSTANDING REQUIREMENT. STATE HAS MANAGED TO GET THE

SUBJECT AS THE NUMBER ONE TALKING POINT ON VICE PRES GORE’S RECENT

CONFERENCE DISCUSSIONS. THE BELARUSIAN RESPONSE WAS TO TRY IT

AGAIN LOCALLY IN MINSK, OFFERING INCREASED "COPY FEES".

5. THE ARRB CHAIRMAN HAS COME BACK TO STATE TO ASK THEY
CON! CTTHE AGENCY -WETH~PHE-FOLLOWING_REQUEST.. J@RNOTHES
CHECK WITH~THEAESB/SVR, TO DETERMINE WHETHER-THE RUSSIANS RETAINED
*A COPY OF THE<LEE HARVEY OSWALD’S>KGB FILE IN MOSCOW? CAN WE GET
ACCESS TO THE FILE AND, PRESUMABLY, OBTAIN A COPY FOR THE ARRB?
WE NOTE THAT THE ARRB WILL PROBABIY—PUSH_-HARD_TO_DECLASSLF¥—THE
RUSSIAN DOCUMENTS AS WELL. (OBVIOUSLY-SUCH-A-REQUEST-COULD”~ HAVE
+ SHVERALTWIMPLICATIONS WHICHOWE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER, I.E.; THE
USSIANS MIGHT ASK FOR FILES OF THE ROSENBERGS OR OTHER NOTORIOUS
PERSONALITIES. THE HOS CONTEXT IS THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH |

RB ON A VARIETY OF OTHER SERIOUS DECLASSIFICATION/DISCLOSURE
SSUES AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE IN A BETTER NEGOTIATING POSITION IF
GOULD BE SEEN AS ASSISTING THEIR EFFORTS TO GET THE OSWALD FILE.

6. OBVIOUSLY SUCH AN ACTION_HAS TREMENDOUS IMPLICATIONS AND
WE WELCOME A FULL DIALOGUE FROM-GTATTON-ON THIS MATTER.
