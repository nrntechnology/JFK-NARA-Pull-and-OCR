WILSTED emphasized that the whole tolephone. systen in Mexico
"sty dsiundergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.;
- has subssontracted this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
“gysten tothe independent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up unused and
, Old lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
“laying. underground cables, etc. Eventually we should be better off be-
cause: there should be more surplus lines. The renovation vork has
“hampered much of the LIF@AT work, principally because many of the Lines
“now ape underground and we carmot get access. to them before they enter
the:sontral.. This is particularly trun with respect to the Czech Emo
‘bassy,.to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
,Podnt we now occupy.

. : “3e WILSTED seid that we try to keep track of the activities of
‘ "Intel" but since they seem to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no
Prior warning of their presence in a certain area.

4. In the recent past, ‘exico has baen using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. ‘e have more control over the access of
phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. Jlowever, under new
regulations, all new apartment buildings must havo telephone lines ine
atalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
phase. This means that tho lines and their destination are concealed,
WILSTED preposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since
we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
way that the phone company cannot trace ita destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then install a separate line to the build-
ing and hook. up the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will
belong to a. legitimate subscriber.

S. One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two hnlf
pairs then form one good pair which we can use.

6 WILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a

reguler telephone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company
bond, which later can be sold. —
