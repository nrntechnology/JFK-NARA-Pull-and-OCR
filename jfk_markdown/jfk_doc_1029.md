am not too far off in what I am about to tell you. The contract
was structured in such,a way ithat as the bottoms of other
companies became obsolete, they could only be replaced with
Onassis’ tankers. Even ARAMCO had to, by attrition, within a
period of four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half years, would have,
if their tankers became obsolete, they could only be replaced
by Onassis tankers.

Our statistics, after having studied the contract and
making what we considered to be proper projections, indicated
that at the completion of approximately five-and-a-half years,
Mr. Onassis would control -more dead weight tonnage than the
United States controlled in its entirety, that he would control

on the high seas annually more oil by tens of thousands of

gallons more than were used by all of the Allied nations during
the most severe year of the Korean War, that in the first year
his profit would be approximately $17 million dollars, that
after five-and-a-half years his annual profit would be in the
area of $200 million.

While this analysis is going on, we also found that a

Twitchell had spent time in the country

old King Saud. MECY
as a mining engineer to help them in the exploitation of

mines. It was in fact to chen

AwEChSTI? that the old king gave
the power of attorney to come to the United States government
or come back to the United States and try to form a consortium

for the exploitation of oil from which emanated ARAMCO.

Ss ie as the type of man who was only reimbursed for his
expenses. I think his total expenses were slightly in excess

of $8,000. He didn't even keep the banking and percentage

for himself, or a piece of the action, so to speak, and he was
highly, highly loved by the Saudis and although the old king

was then gone and King Saud, the sony. was in power, Mr¥

had the same respect and reverence from the present

that -- he already had a clearance, a satisfactory clearance,

and I convinced him to precede me to Saudi Arabia to try to
lay the groundwork.

Senator Schweiker. What year was this, roughly?

Mr. Maheu. This, I believe, was in '54 or ‘55, yes.

Anyway, I finally ended up going to Saudi Arabia, having
a meeting with the King's confidential assistant, presenting al
of this evidence, frankly at the time not knowing if the King .
himself had a piece of the action --

Senator Huddleston. Had some of this evidence come from

the wiretap?

Mr. Maheu. That tap was entirely unproductive, entirely
unproductive.

Senator Schweiker. What happened then at your meeting?

Mr. Maheu. Well, it's very interesting, if we could take
a little time, I mean, I was scheduled to have the meeting
"with the King," but he doesn't show, he stays somewhere else
and the confidential assistant shows up and one trusted
minister that he had with CHMBEMMECCHSD) present.

And my meeting was scheduled for 8:00 p.m. one night, and
this happaned to be the last day that the King was supposed to
be in Jidda, he was then leaving for the capital further
inland, Jidda being the only major port in Saudi where he
spends his summers, and they were having a big parade for him,

and from the balcony of the hotel, I'm watching the parade go

‘by, and finally the King's car comes and he is arm and arm with

the: nan on whom I'm going to give the evidence that night, and
I frankly was not too comfortable, particularly in view of the
fact that in those days -- and t don't know whether it has
changed, but in Saudi, the same document did not give you
permission to enter and leave; you had to make application for
an exit visa after you arrived, and I was in constant contact
with the then-United States Ambassador. He made it very clear
that the government approved of everything I was doing, but if
something went wrong they could not come to my rescue, I would

have to be the fall guy, and I was prepared to do it. That was

Saudi Arabian government would have its flag flying the high
seas, and at the time that all of this is going on they are
building what then, upon completion of production, had been

the biggest tanker in the world at that time, a ship named
after the old King, a tanker which was scheduled to go and take
a maiden flight and take off, and it turned out the biggest
problem that we had was to find a save-face gimmick. But
finally the whole thing was accomplished, and it took two and

a half years to do it.

Senator Schweiker. I didn't mean to get you off the
track.

Mr. Maheu. Well, I'm sorry I am so verhose.

Senator Huddleston. You said you bought a paper in.
Athens? You mean by that you actually bought the paper or just
paid them to run the story?

Mr. Maheu. We bought a newspaper.

You'll have to understand, Senator, that in Rome, in those
days, there were fifty newspapers. I mean, the big circulation
-in these days, ‘big circulation in Rome was 20,000. It's hard
for us to visualize that.

Senator Huddleston.

Mr. Maheu. Yes.
Can we go off the record?

Mr. Liebengood. Was this listening post that you referred”
to, was that a project that was related to work for the Central

Mr. Maheu. I don't believe it was.

Mr. Madigan. Did you have any New York assignments other
than Onassis that you gave to Frank?

Mr. Maheu. I don't remember any.

Mr. Madigan. How about @ I may have asked
you that yesterday. Do you recall whether he had any relation-
ship with your company during the 1950's?

Mr. Maheu. I don't remember a ffeme

Mr. Madigan. A CIA employee.
Mr. Maheu. I don't recall his name.

Mr. Madigan. I got sidetracked off of my question: of

whether you recall a prosecution or an investigation of the
Onassis wiretap. You may have already have answered that.

Mr. Maheu. . I think I did, yes.

Mr. Madigan. What did you say? :

Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that I appeared before a
Grand Jury that was investigating Mr. Frank on another
matter.

Mr. Madigan. On another matter, but you had no recollection

of any investigation of that particular tap?

Mr. Maheu. No, I don't.

Mr, Madigan. You have no inclination or no feeling at

assignment or whether it was a PR kind of assignment? No idea?

Mr. Mahew. I don't know.

Mr. Madigan. Was there ever an island involved with that
assignment to your knowledge?

Mr. Maheu. Not to my recollection.

Mr. Madigan. During the 1969's did you employ. a fellow

Mr. Maheu. I believe that from time to time a Jack
Buckley did work for Robart A. Maheu Associates. I don't
believe he was an employee.

Mr. Madigan. Would he be on a kind of an intermittent
contract basis like Frank was? You would use him every once in

Aircraft in that particular venture threatened to sue Howard
Hughes and all of the Hughes interest for non-fulfiliment of
contract, and I made a recommendation to that person whose
name slips my mind, but I believe his last name was Jamie,
J-a-m-i-s or something like that, I don't recall. But to try
to discourage him from filing such a lawsuit I suggested that
he and I put up $10,000 in BEWgggie and check into the
possibility of developing business there.

I put up my ten, he never put his up, and Msiar was the

one who was involved. ‘But when the Agency nesded a cover for

an assignment in @65 %*Meier was made privy of this by the
Agency.
Mr. Liebengood. Just to be certain I understand, this

That's right.

As a matter of fact, it's my recollection I found out
about this afterwards.
