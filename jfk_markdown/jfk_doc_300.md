a Summary of Case

- The -NOSENKO case opened-on 5 June 1962: in the corridors:

. of the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations .

Disarmament Conference. A Soviet official approached an -
‘American diplomat with the Suggestion that they get together

‘forvastalk the following day. The diplomat advised CIA.of |

‘the appointment, explaining that he thought the’ approach: so

» unusual Chat. it might’ be an offer of cooperation or deféction...:

- He said*he believed the Soviet to be’ Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO,

ms member of the Soviet. Disarmament Delegation. ee Tt

J. Later’ meeting with the American diplomat,. the’ Soviet
official identified himself -as NOSENKO. and stated

: KGB counterintelligence officer sent to Geneva to ensure the...
security of the Soviet delegation. He knew that the American
had previously’ served in Moscow and erroneously believed that |
~he was the “American Rezident" in Geneva.  ‘NOSENKO stated...
‘that. he needed approximately 900. Swiss francs immediately“to -
_ cover. KGB operational’ funds which he had squandered on- ae

. liquor and a prostitute’ in Geneva. He offered for: this amount
“to sell’ two items.of: information: to American. Intelligence...

| These’were the identity of a former American Embassy employee ..
» in Moscow who was a KGB. agent "hear ciphers" in the Washington
area, and the identity of a Soviet in Moscow who, although...”
_ostensibly a CIA agent, was’ actually controlled by. the. KGB. .°
“In reply; the American’. explained that-he was not an intelli-
gence officer, but that. he could place NOSENKO in contact

: with. an appropriate U.S. official in’ Geneva later that, same

_ .That evenin
hour meeting f

(Summary of Case)

the two items ot°information. He said that the need for money
was his immediate motive fcr contacting CLA, alchough in the
ensuing discussion he aiso expressed dissatisfaction with the
Communist regime in the Soviet Union.

NOSENKO met CIA‘ representarives four more times in Geneva
in June 1962. With the second meeting on ll June, his earlier
expressed reservations disappeared almost entirely. He
answered most questions put to him on KGB organization and
operations. His knowledgeability was almost exciusively
Limited to the KGB Second Chief Directorate (responsible for
counterintelligence and security within che USSR). NOSENKO
seemed to be what he claimed to be: a KGB officer ina
sensitive position with knowledge of important KGB operations.

NOSENKO returned to Moscow on 15 June, having promised
to do everything within certain limits to collect information
on matters indicated to be of interest to CIA. The only
restrictions he placed on his cooperation were his absolute
refusal to permit operational contact with him inside the
USSR and his request that no mention of his coilaboration be
communicated to the American Embassy in Moscow. He promised
to notify CIA via an accommodation address when he came to
the West again. ,;

NOSENKO again accompanied the Soviet delegation to the
Disarmament Conference in Geneva in January 1964. Since last
meeting with CIA he had been promoted to the rank of lieu- |

tenant colonel and had become the Deputy Chief of the largest
department in the Second Chief Directorate. At the first
of the new series of meetings on 23 January he announced
that he had decided to defect to the United States. He
cited as reasons his continuing dissatisfaction with the
Soviet regime and the fact. that he. probably would have no
further opportunities to travel to the West in the foresee-
able future. Although he implied that he wanted to defect
as soon as possible, he agreed to remain in place in Geneva
while arrangements for his reception were being made in
Washington. NOSENKO had brought a large amount of new
information, much of it in scribbled notes, on KGB opera-
tional activity which he had collected in the 18 months
since his last meeting with CIA.

(Summary of Case)

During NOSENKO's absence from Washington, consultations
were held with the FBI regarding steps to be taken to restrict
his movements and activities. This Agency was concerned
that his behavior would attract undesirable attention and
publicity, perhaps police arrest, and that doubts about his
bona fides, which were becoming known to a widening group

in the U.S. Government, might be inadvertently revealed to
NOSENKO himself. The FBI on 1 April indicated ict would

"not interpose objection" to the CLA plan to limit NOSENKO's
.freedom of movement, and the Acting Attorney General, the
Department of State, and the White House were advised.

On 4 April NOSENKO was driven to a new safehouse ina
‘Washington suburb, and told that this safehouse thenceforward
would be his regular place of residence. Since that time’
NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been
under full-time guard, and has not been permitted access to
news media.

Intensive interrogation of NOSENKO, including a polygraphic
examination, was begun on 4 April 1964 in order to obtain
‘information which he had been reluctant to divulge earlier,
and to clarify contradictions in what he had already reported.
The polygraph examination results were inconclusive. This
phase of the interrogations was terminated on 24 April 1964.

Despite the searching nature of the questions and the
implicitly and explicitly expressed doubts of his veracity,
NOSENKO asserted that he was willing to answer, or to try to
answer all questions put‘to him. Because more information
pertinent to the question of his bona fides was needed, a
new series of interrogations was begun in mid-May 1964.
Different interrogators were introduced and questioning was
‘resumed in a neutral, non~hostile manner. The period of
neutral questioning continued until mid-November 1964.

After further consultations with the FBI, a round of |
hostile interrogations began on 26 January 1965. Between .
then and 5 March, NOSENKO was questioned for a total of
about 140 hours by individual interrogators and interrogation
teams, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous
assertions. He admitted that certain of his earlier statements.
had been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions

in his testimony. Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had -
. been basically truthful, and that ‘he- had come to. the United’.
States solely for the reasons he had originally given.
These interrogations. were suspended on 5 March 1965...'.:

(Summary of Case)

Oo suggest any changes o¢
fact or presentation which would maké them more accurate,

Commenting on the use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said
on 4 March 1965: "My lif
I absolutely

understand what I am doing when I an signing any paper,

This is an officidi document, and I fully underscand what \
I'm doing when I sign it as being absolutely correct."

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until
14 August 1965 with the Participation of Petr DERYABIN, a
former KGB officer. These interrogations, held in Russian,
were for the Purpose of using DERYABIN's KGB experience to
obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's claimed personal
and professional background.

During the period 19-25: October 1966, NOSENKO was
questioned for seven days on specific aspects of selected
tepics ranging from his identity to his involvement in and
knowledge of specific KGB Operations. Questioning was in
both Russian and English. Although the interrogations
identified topics and time periods in NOSENKO's accounts
which contained the greatest number of Contradictions and

discrepancies, neither the contradictions nor the discrep-
ancies could be resolved, -

Because of the incidence of deranged persons CIA has

encountered among would—be defectors, the question of

: NOSENKO's mental stability was a Matter considered early
after his defection in Geneva. Fron his arrival in the
United States in 1964 NOSENKO has been under psychiatric
observation. A CIA Psychiatrist and a CIA PSychologist,
both with extensive experience with Soviet Bloc defectors,
monitored many of NOSENKO's Anterrogations. In May 1965
the psychologist for three weeks questioned NOSENKO on his
life from birth until 1953, when NOSENKO claimed he joined
the KGB; in an attempt to identify psychological factors
which might underlie NOSENKO'

The psychiatrist
and the psychologist concluded independently, on the basis

of their observations, that NOSENKO was mentally stable.

FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS

«

Evidence of NOSENKO's bona Fides is comprised of his own
statements, the corroborating statements of Soviet officials, |
and the counterintelligence information he has provided.

NOSENKO's Statements About Himself

In his meetings. in 1962 and 1964 with CIA abroad and in
the course of the interrogations since, NOSENKO has: made
numerous statements about himself. More than any other,
however, a statement written in July 1964 (after the initial
hostile interrogation was concluded) is a thoughtful and
well-expressed exposition of how he wished CIA to regard

him. It is quoted here in its entirety.

My life, my childhood and ‘youth passed in very
comfortable circumstances since the position of
my father gave us. the opportunity to live without
lacking for anything. And the only difficult
periods of my life before the death of my father
were at the naval schools attended in Kuybyshev,
Baku and Leningrad, and at the beginning of my
working life, when I was in the Far East in 1950-
1952. The opportunity. to be always well-dressed,
to have a sufficient amount of money, to have my
own car, to be able to use the car given me by ny
family and also my father's car, the opportunity
to travel to the South and to vacation .in the best
sanitariums, dachas, and so forth; all this
unquestionably Iéft its mark on me and became
something of a habit. After the death of my father,
my successful progress in my work gave me a higher
salary, and although I did not have all that which
I had while my father was alive, still I did not
experience any serious difficulties. But already
I wanted to live still better.

successes, when in fact they didn't exist, the
figures about how the USSR had passed the USA in
the production of butter and milk, when in the
stores they were available only infrequently. The
endless promises of a better life when in fact
nothing of tthe sort is taking place. All this
‘similarly forced me to re-evaluate not only the
events which were taking place in the country, but
already the entire ideology of the Party, its
external and internal course.

The events in Novocherkassk where 20,000 to
25,000 people rose up and the way in which this
popular indignation was suppressed by troops with
Many casualties. This also made a deep impression
on me. When I was resting in the summer of 1961
in Nikolayev, from my relatives--my father's
brothers--I understood well the real relation of
the workers both to the leadership and to the
Party as a whole. At the same time I saw how the
workers really lived, how they eat, what they have
and what they can buy with their wages.

I heard a great deal from my father about the
domestic pdlicies of Khrushchev in regard to the
development and the course of construction in
industry, about his complete illiteracy in.
engineering technology and industrial economics,
about incorrect decisions in regard to many
industries, and this was not only the opinion of

“my father, but also of other important leaders in
various fields of industry. But no one dared to
open his mouth and when in December 1955 my father
tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain.
decision would be incorrect, he received such a
rebuff from Khrushchev that he was profoundly
shaken and in the opinion of my mother this brought
him to his illness and death in August 1956.

The events in Germany and especially in Hungary
showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy of
communist ideology. What was especially important
for me was the fact that in these countries it was a
Protest not of individuals or groups, but of the

I entered the Komsomol completely without thinking
about it. The time came, the right age, and I
became a Komsomol member like all the others. It
was different in regards to the Party: I joined
the Party in-1956 after the death of Stalin and
while I was working in the KGB and already at that
time there was a lack of faith and indecisiveness
: in me. My father continually insisted on this,
, : saying that without the Party I would never move
4) ahead and would not have success in life. .But I
myself understood and saw that I would not be able
to work in the KGB unless I was a member of the
Party. And if I worked somewhere else, I would
truly never move ahead in my career unless I entered
the Party. But from the very beginning of my entry
into the Party, I deeply hated all the Party talmudism
and dogmatism. All the Party meetings were literally
a torture. Especially when I became the Deputy
Chief and then Chief of a section, and then Deputy
Chief of a department, because then I had to speak
_at these meetings. Because this meant to lie, .to
twist my soul, and to attempt to show myself as
deeply dedicated to the Party and its course.

In 1960 my oldest girl's asthmatic attacks became”
worse. The question of a change of climate was
raised. At that time the Second Chief Directorate

“needed to send an officer to Ethiopia for two to

_ three years to conduct counterintelligence work
among the Soviet specialists there. It cost me a
great deal of effort to personally talk Second Chief
Directorate Chief General GRIBANOV into letting me
go. The Party and work references had been confirmed,
all the questionnaires were already filled out, the
photos had been submitted; that is, all the formal-

1 - ities had been accomplished. -But at the very last -

moment the Central Personnel Office of the KGB began
to protest against my going with my family to
Ethiopia. The reason for this was that from the
house check made at my place of residence they
received information that I sometimes came home in

a drunken condition and on this ground had quarrels
with my wife. A tour abroad with my family was
necessary because of the health of my daughter

If the defections of [former KGB officers] PETROV,
RASTVOROV and DERYABIN passed without evoking any
particular thoughts, the defection to the United
States of GOLITSYN, whom I had heard of as an
intelligent person and a capable officer, undoubtedly

: caused me to think very deeply. Because to act thus,
d it is necessary to have not only boldness and
decisiveness, but also great strength of will. And
already I put to myself the question, will I be able
to act thus in view of the dissatisfactions and
disillusionments which had-accumulated inside of me?

contact with you. The reason for this was the loss
of money received by me for operational expenses.

I would have been unable to accumulate such a sum

of money before my departure and there was nobody

to borrow from. To tell the truth about the loss

of the money would have meant that it would be
necessary to explain where and in what circumstances
it had been lost. This would have risked expulsion
from the KGB and a serious reprimand from the Party.
Not to tell the truth, to think up some sort of a
story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of all, they
might think that I had appropriated the money, that
is, stolen it. And this would be for me the worst
of all. and I would, of course, in such event have
told the truth. :

: stood that you sooner or later would set yourself

I began to feel afraid that the KGB would somehow
learn of my contact with you. This article deeply
‘interested’ the KGB.

During ‘the closed trial of PENKOVSKIY I got a
pass from the Second Department and went, in order
to look at him myself. For sometimes it is enough
to simply look at a man, to see how he holds himself
and to hear how he speaks in order to form some sort
of an initial opinion of him. Personally, I liked
how PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked
his appearance and I understood that everything
which had been said in the KGB about him and the
sort of person they were trying to make him out to
be (that he was morally degraded, that he had
descended and sunk into a swamp) that all this was
nonsense, bluff, and. chatter. And PENKOVSKIY, the

‘same as GOLITSYN, gave me a feeling of greater
confidence in the correctness of the decision taken

The Product of NOSENKO's Debriefing
‘

Positive Intelligence Information

At his first meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO asserted
that he was acquainted with Ministers of the Soviet Govern-
ment, who were friends of his father, and he heard what
was said in their circles. His debriefing and interroga-
tions did not bear out his assertion that he was informed
of the attitudes and aims of the Soviet leaders. His
responses to questions about the viability -of the then
Soviet Government, for example, were couched in vague and
general terms and did not reflect any specific knowledge.
From his debriefing it emerged that NOSENKO had spent his
entire adult life either as a student or as a state security
official, and he stressed that since the early 1950's he
had had few interests and "no real contacts" outside of the
KGB itself. Questioned on a wide range of topics, including

‘various aspects of nuclear weaponry, missiles, electronics,

communications, unconventional weapons, military industry,
military units and equipment, and research and development,
NOSENKO repeatedly said that he had no knowledge of such
matters and that his responses reflected only personal
opinions. Because of his two assignments to Geneva with

the Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference, questions
were put to NOSENKO about Soviet .underground testing, Soviet.
efforts in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,
Soviet disarmament aims and Soviet views of the corresponding
attitudes and intentions of the United States. Becausé

his assignments to the Soviet Disarmament Delegation were

for cover purposes only, NOSENKO disclaimed any special
knowledge. He explained that he took no part in the
substantive work of the Delegation nor did he have any
connection in the USSR with officials or organizations

‘concerned with arms control or disarmament policies.

NOSENKO's failure to provide any useful positive
intelligence information was not unique, although previous
KGB defectors did not have NOSENKO's claimed access, either
on the basis of his family ties or on the basis of his KGB
counterintelligence position within the Soviet Union. KGB

Mrs. JOHNSON, and James Allen MINTKENBAUGH. Twenty~five of

this number acknowledged KGB recruitment before or after
NOSENKO's information was received. In fifteen other _
instances NOSENKO's information has been corroborated in

‘part by the individuals' admissions of contact with (if

not recruitment by) the KGB, or by other sources' reports
of their recruitment. Besides these 51, NOSENKO provided
leads to four other American KGB agents, including an
officer in an American military intelligence organization,
none of whom has: yet been identified. Lastly, NOSENKO
identified 22 Americans whom the KGB knew or suspected to
be American Intelligence agents.

From NOSENKO's information 68 non-American KGB agents
have been identified. Although investigations are still
incomplete, in 39 of these cases the individual's KGB
recruitment has been reported by other sources, or the
individuals were suspect forjother reasons. Among these
68 individuals were ajFrench|'and a Canadian Ambassador to
Moscow, an Austrian and an /{ndonesian Army Attache}, a if
Director and a.Deputy Secretaty of the [indian Foreigni|
Ministry, and a British Admiralty employee (William VASSALL,

-gee below). -In addition, NOSENKO provided leads on 22 other

KGB foreign agents, yet to be identified. NOSENKO's infor- _
mation about the KGB electronic attack on the |German Embassy||
in Moscow was confirmed by subsequent technical and physical

search...

With respect to the KGB itself, NOSENKO named (if not
completely identified) approximately 1,000 Soviet citizens
who are or have been affiliated with. Soviet intelligence :

and security organizations. These included over seven

hundred active KGB staff officers, of whom 435 were serving ~
in the Second Chiéf Directorate. Of the 165 KGB officers

he named as belonging to the First Chief (Foreign Intelli-~
gence) Directorate, over one hundred had been previously
reported to be KGB personnel, as reflected in CIA files.
NOSENKO's information permitted updating CIA holdings on
previously received reports of the 1959 KGB reorganization,
particularly as it affected the Second Chief Directorate,

He described further refinement of responsibilities, the
Second Chief Directorate's absorption of previously inde-
pendent directorates, the creation of new units from elements

shown to Premier Khrushchev personally. Although still _
active, the agent had lost access to classified documents.
some months earlier, in 1963. NOSENKO characterized the
lead as the most important single counterintelligence item |
that he acquired during the year and a half he was a CIA
collaborator at KGB Headquarters in Moscow.

soonest NOSENKO''s ‘Information

Shortly after returning to Moscow from Geneva in 1962,
NOSENKO first learned of a KGB agent's successful penetra-
tion of a classified documents vault at an “important
American military installation" in the Paris area. Because
the documents included information on strategic targets in
France as well as in the Soviet Union, he assumed that it
was a "strategic planning installation" The installation
had its own airfield and that there were "procedures for
bringing Top Secret documents in and for taking them out".

There had been six successful entries of the vault, four
in 1962 and two in 1963, On each occasion Special Section
technicians travelled TDY to Paris under diplomatic courier
cover to assist the local KGB case officer in: the technical
details of the operation. Their function was to advise the

case officer concerning the entry'to the vault and later
surreptitiously to unwrap and re-seal the documents. The
case officer, on this basis, would give appropriate instruc-
‘tions to his agent, and the technicians probably never met
-the American.. .

Although this was a ‘First Chief: Directorate operation,

_ officers of the Special Section of the Second Chief
Directorate were used. . The.Special Section was comprised

‘of technicians transferred from the KGB Operational-
Technical Directorate, and usually it handled surreptitious
entries to Western embassies in Moscow. Among these officers
were S.A. IONOV, L.A. LEBEDEV, S.D. ILYIN, V.V. SINITSYN,
V.Z. KARETNIKOV, M.I. PREOBRAZHENSKIY and Fedor FOFANOV. ©
IONOV, LEBEDEV and ILYIN took part in this operation, and
FOFANOV was later involved.

‘The specialists were not the ones that carried out the

operation. It was carried out by the case officers of the
Paris Legal Residency. The specialists just opened and then

The last time the vault was entered was in the fall of

1963. At about that time the agent, a military man,

received a promotion and was relieved of his night watch
duties. (The agent was scheduled for rotation to the

United States but, with his promotion, he had obtained an
extension until May 1964.) Although the agent was still
active in January 1964 and was still assigned to the same
military post, he had lost access to the classified :
documents. The information obtained from the agent's vault

‘was highly sensitive and so valuable to the KGB that the

Paris Legal Rezident as well as several case officers there
had been rewarded for their part in the operation.

Before leaving Moscow for Geneva in January 1964,
NOSENKO had been told that the technician FOFANOV had been
sent to Paris in the KGB hope that the agent would be able
to re-enter the vault again before his transfer to the

. United States in May. .When NOSENKO visited the Soviet
Embassy in-Paris on 19 January 1964 while-en route to

Geneva, FOFANOV was on duty at the entrance and NOSENKO

“chatted with him. FOFANOV said he-"was not doing good"

and he "would probably be sitting there until May", but
he had hopes "that something might happen". .

The American agént was getting paid by the KGB and he.

was recruited with the promise of a substantial sum of

money. NOSENKO didn't know if he was recruited in Paris

or if it was even a formal recruitment, nor what plans the
KGB had for him after he left Paris. .

- NOSENKO learned of the case “in little pieces" at
separate times from various members of the Second Chief —

_., Directorate Special Section who participated in it, . ;
‘principally LEBEDEV or KARETNIKOV in Moscow, and FOFANOV

later in Paris. [Under intensive questioning, NOSENKO has

-also alleged he learned of the case from IONOV, the Chief.

of the Special Section.] NOSENKO explained that he knew
LEBEDEV and KARETNIKOV from their visit to his office to
discuss technical installations at new tourist hotels, when
NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

relevant intelligence of any significance. NOSENKO thought
that "SASHA" served as a department chief in intelligence
when he was re-assigned to Germany in November 1962 - early
1963.

NOSENKO met SHALYAPIN for the first time in September or
October 1962 [after NOSENKO's first visit to Geneva and
initial contact with CIA] through his friend, Yu. I. GUK.-
GUK had known SHALYAPIN when they had served together in
the First Chief Directorate in Moscow. SHALYAPIN had
served in the United States, Uruguay, Berlin, and Cuba. In

1962 he had been assigned to the Latin American Department
of the First Chief Directorate, as a case officer. He
retired from the KGB and through NOSENKO's intervention with
Second Chief Directorate Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV,
SHALYAPIN obtained-a position with Inturist. Presumably
out of gratitude to NOSENKO, SHALYAPIN felt free to talk,
and over drinks he expressed his bitterness at his treat-
ment by the First Chief Directorate which, without hin,
‘would not have had the agent "SASHA" in Germany “at that —

discussed the case -with-SHALYAPIN “at some time". Pressed
.-to identify his first source, NOSENKO then cited several
officers--some First’ Chief Directorate, some Second-who
could have told him about it. because they were likely to
know of it though none of. them was actually involved in the
operation. Ultimately NOSENKO refused to commit himself

“ANDREY" (Dayle W. SMITH)

When contacting ‘CIA in 1962 NOSENKO offered to sell
information about two KGB operations, one of which he knew
only under the KGB cryptonym "ANDREY", a KGB agent recruited
in Moscow in 1949 or 1950 who in 1962 was working in
Washington "near ciphers"

NOSENKO's Information~1962

"ANDREY" was a U.S. Army sergeant who was spotted for the
KGB by "QUEBEC" (Roy RHODES). [RHODES served in Moscow
from April 1951 to July 1953. He dated his own recruitment
by the KGB as January 1952.] RHODES was still in Moscow.
when "ANDREY" was recruited by the Second Chief Directorate,
although RHODES was not aware of "“ANDREY's" recruitment.
The KGB approach to NANDREY" was based on “women and money"

_MANDREY" ‘worked satisfactorily ‘in Moscow for the KGB,.

providing ' ‘materials" and information on ciphers. He

promised that he would cooperate with the-KGB in future
assignments abroad, but would not work with them in ‘the

| United. States as he did not want to "sit in the electric

chair". He was paid well for his cooperation in Moscow.

The KGB wanted to. pay him more but’ he refused; he said he
could not plausibly explain the possession. of -too much

money. When the. KGB offéred him diamonds and other gems for
later sale, he did not take then, telling his case officers
that possession could arouse the attention of the. American

police. In 1950 the agent left. Moscow for the United
‘States. The KGB. waited for him to reappear in some other
_country,. but he did. not. Finally, in 1955, the KGB sent

V.M. KOVSHUK, the then-Chief of the American Embassy Section

'of the Second Chief Directorate, and a participant in.

"ANDREY's" recruitment in Moscow, to the United States to
find the agent. KOVSHUK travelled under the alias "KOMAROV",
under the cover of either Second or Third Secretary of the
Soviet Embassy in Washington.

RHODES. Little by little, however, "ANDREY" resumed his
meetings with the KGB, "having little other choice". :

KOVSHUK turned “ANDREY" over to a member of the Washington

Legal Residency and returned to Moscow. NOSENKO did not

know who succeéded KOVSHUK as the handler, but KOVSHUK's
successor eventually turned the case over to N.G. BAGRICHEV,.:
who concluded his tour in Washington in 1961. NOSENKO. did
not know BAGRICHEV's successor, but asserted that there —
must have been one since. "ANDREY" was still working with

the KGB in 1962.

NOSENKO's Information-1964

- While continuing to associate “ANDREY's" recruitment

with RHODES' presence in Moscow, NOSENKO in different

discussions of the case asserted that. "ANDREY" was recruited
in "1948-1949", "in'1952 or earlier", or "in 1953".

"ANDREY" had been recruited by KOVSHUK and N.M. BORODIN.
After returning to the United ‘States, "“ANDREY" worked at-
the Pentagon, "in codes", but by the. time KOVSHUK. recontacted
him in: the United States” he was’ néaring the end of his
enlistment, and he was working in an Army recruiting office.

-° He was stilil-working in the recruiting office when BAGRICHEV

took over the case from KOVSHUK.

“It was not. RHODES’ trial at which “ANDREY" appeared, but

he was among persons called during the pre-trial investigation.

"“ANDREY" was called just once, and he was scared to death. |

_TANDREY" did not testify at the RHODES trial.

In Moscow, "ANDREY" Had explained to the KGB how the code
machines in the Embassy: worked and may have given the KGB
parts of. code machines such as "“dises" [sic, meaning rotors].

“: Aleksandr SELEZNEV, a deputy department chief in. the

Communications Directorate of the KGB, had been involved in

“the “ANDREY" case: NOSENKO first saw him in 1953 during the

period that "ANDREY" was.working for the KGB in Moscow.
SELEZNEV came to meetings in the American Department to
discuss and plan KGB meetings with "ANDREY". The reason for
SELEZNEV's presence was that the case officers were not
technical specialists, and SELEZNEV would supply them with

-queations to be asked of iM ANDREY", Since SELEZNEV ‘came tio
.these meetings’.in civilian clothes, whereas NOSENKO later

“Saw him in.uniform in his visits to the, American Department,

NOSENKO spéculated that SELEZNEV may “have attended some of

_y, the meetings’ with "ANDREY". | Although NOSENKO did not know ~--:
“how the KGB exploited hin, he repeatedly emphasized "ANDREY' s"

yereat: importance to the KGB during the. time he worked for

them in Moscow.:.."Thanks' to his help. they were able to read
-your. State Department. codes... "To: date we have never been ;

Edward Ellis SMITH

-NOSENKO's Information

In. the context of a 1962 discussion of KGB operations
against the American Embassy in Moscow, NOSENKO was askéd
! whether he knew "about SMITH". He answered: "SMITH?. The
vee - | ved-head.° Listen, he headed the FBI, he was a.colonel and
, headed counterintelligence." NOSENKO went on to describe
a _the mounting of a blackmail operation, of which he was

{ : the. case officer, against SMITH (whose KGB cryptonym was
"RYZHIY", or "REDHEAD"). .

\ “
B , _. §MITH had: been sleeping with his Russian housemaid, who
: was an agent planted on him by the KGB. When the KGB was
; unable to obtain actual incriminating photographs, she was
a instructed to take photographs of herself on SMITH's bed.

: These were then combined.with photographs of SMITH to
produce photomontages, copies of which were delivered to
SMITH together with a letter inviting him to a meeting with
the KGB. SMITH came. The KGB was represented at. the
meeting. by GRIBANOV, NOSENKO and one other officer. At
this initial meeting SMITH was not interrogated nor asked
for classified information. SMITH agreed to come to further

meetings.

(FOUNDATION OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

When SMITH did not come to the next scheduled meeting
with GRIBANOV, NOSENKO sought out the maid to find out what
had happened. She reported that SMITH was in a state of
desperate indecision; he had paced his room all night as
if his mood was alternating between despair and defiance.

To increase the pressure on him, the KGB sent him threatening
letters on each of the succeeding three days. Finally, on
the third day, instead of meeting the KGB, SMITH went to
Ambassador BOHLEN and reported the blackmail attempt. SMITH
was immediately withdrawn from Moscow and (as of 1962) he

was "still in intelligence work".

In 1964 and afterwards NOSENKO denied that he had played
any personal role in the case. He explained that as a
junior officer in the American Embassy Section at the time,
working on correspondents, he would not have taken part in f
so important an operation. He said that he had heard about:
the operation from V. M. KOVSHUK, SMITH's case officer.
(On a later occasion NOSENKO said that his only personal
role was being assigned to a phone-watch to receive .
surveillance reports connected with the initial KGB approach
to SMITH.)

? GOLITSYN's Information

In February 1962 GOLITSYN reported that in 1957 he had
read a two-volume KGB study. which gave examples of successful
operations against the Embassy in Moscow. One case concerned
an American, probably single, who was either the Security
Officer or the counterintelligence representative inthe
Embassy. He had a dog, .and lived in an apartment in the
city or a country house outside Moscow. His Russian maid

_ or cleaning.’ woman was his mistress. The KGB concluded that
the American would not. succumb to ordinary blackmail and

consequently the maid, a KGB agent, was instructed to confess
to him that she had been recruited by the KGB against her

will and would be arrested if she did not fulfill her KGB
tasks. The American agreed to help her, and GOLITSYN believed
that he did not report this to his Washington headquarters.
GOLITSYN also recalled that the American first supplied

only misinformation to the KGB, but when the KGB complained,
he provided a mixture of truth and misinformation. GOLITSYN
said the case study he read was based on a true incident

which took place between 1953 and 1957, but he was not sure
that the operation actually resulted in a successful recruit-—
ment, as was alleged in the study.

Comment: Edward Ellis SMITH (a redhead), Embassy
Security Officer (and CIA employee) from
July 1954 to June 1956, reported to the
Ambassador on 5 June 1956 that he had received
four letters from the KGB. The first,
received on 2 June 1956, enclosed incriminating
photographs of himself and his Russian maid and
requested him to come to a personal meeting
with KGB representatives outside the Embassy.
When he did not do so, SMITH subsequently had
received three threatening letters. In !
reporting the matter to the Ambassador, SMITH -
admitted having been intimate with his Russian
maid. SMITH was recalled from Moscow on
8 June 1956, and he left CIA employment a year
later. When interviewed in March 1962 on the

_basis of the GOLITSYN information, SMITH

admitted that he had maintained his affair
with the Russian maid during most of the time
of his Moscow assignment, 20 July 1954 to
8 June 1956, and confirmed that to help her
he had in fact passed unclassified information
through her to the KGB for many months.

NOSENKO clearly ascribed the SMITH operation.
to the period when NOSENKO was in the American
Embassy Section, in 1953-1955. SMITH's state-
ment that he reported the blackmail attempt to
the Ambassador in June 1956 is confirmed. I£
NOSENKO was, as he says, transferred to the
Seventh Department in 1955, he could not have
played any role in the KGB approach to SMITH.
If he played such a role, he was in the Embassy
Section in 1956, not in the Seventh Department
as he claims. lf he played a role in ‘the SMITH
case as well as_in the Seventh Department
recruitment of [BURGT} (see p.115), it remains (4
possible that he was neither an officer in the
Embassy Section nor Seventh Department and was
acting in some other KGB capacity.

CHAPTER IL

EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

What NOSENKO has said about himself, the information
about the KGB which he has provided, and the apparently
corroborative statements which Soviet officials have made
since his defection represent prima facie evidence that
NOSENKO is a former senior KGB officer. To permit a
conclusive judgment that he is a bona fide defector, the
information NOSENKO provides about his life and related fe
persons and events must be coherent, and his accounts of
important events must be consistent. Allowing for personal
vagaries such as lapses of memory and so forth, as well
as for factors of accident and coincidence, the information
he relates must conform within reasonable limits with that
which is known from independent and reliable sources to
the United States Government about Soviet realities and
about the events, topics and individuals NOSENKO describes.
Lastly, the information NOSENK provides must plausibly
relate primarily to the KGB positions he held, and his
account of how he functioned in these positions must be
substantiated by verisimilar detail. . :

The following portions of this paper, organized in

chronological fashion insofar as possible, summarize this
examination of the significant aspects of NOSENKO's claims.

Notes for the Reader

In order to follow the examination as presented the
reader should note the following:

The examination tests the validity of the presumptive
evidence favoring NOSENKO in terms of coherence, consistency,
and compatibility with fact and plausibility.

(EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES)

Notes for the Reader (Continued)

NOSENKO's claims are judged in the light of his own
assertions and in comparison with collateral information.
It is not the function of the examination to speculate
about possibly. credible alternative explanations for the
paradoxes reflected in NOSENKO's statements, except when
such explanations are advanced by NOSENKO himself.

If there is no immediate explanatory note pointing out
the relevance or significance of some item in the text, the
reader may expect that the item's relevance or significance
usually will be developed in the immediately-following text.
Otherwise seemingly minor points are included because of
their aggregative significance: they will be a matter of |
comment in the Summary and Conclusions section following
each major portion of the examination.

Direct questions and NOSENKO's replies about his |

contradictions, inconsistencies, ambiguities, retractions,
omissions and the like, are reflected in the text. Where, |
during his interrogations, it was not possible to pose
direct questions without furnishing NOSENKO information or
vite ot insight into the interrogators' purposes, the topic was
: covered exhaustively if indirectly, and NOSENKO was

‘Provided every opportunity to comment on the matter in

question. When the text indicates that NOSENKO apparently
Was not asked about a particular matter, or that "hé didn't

“say", or "didn't comment" or "didn't indicate awareness"

and so. forth, the reader Properly may assume that the

matter was covered extensively.

; In instances in which NOSENKO contradicts or retracts
earlier assertions, no more weight is necessarily given
to his final assertion -as opposed to earlier contrary claims.

To assist the reader in following what are sometimes
lengthy and complex accounts of events, NOSENKO's narrative
is broken from time to time by a clearly identified
editorial comment which seeks to draw the reader's attention
to the relevance or Significance of NOSENKO's assertions,
.or to what conclusion is drawn.

CHAPTER III

PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY

NOSENKO's biography from birth to entry into the KGB is
relevant to his bona fides insofar as it is material to
establishing his true identity, his general veracity, and.
his eventual eligibility for KGB service. Below are
summarized pertinent events in his early life, his study
at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, and
his RU service, as reconstructed from statements he
volunteered as well as from the accounts obtained in
repeated interrogations.

Birth to 1945 - NOSENKO's Account

NOSENKO was born on.30 October 1927 in Nikolayev, in the
Ukraine. Atithe time of. Ais birth, his father, Ivan
‘Isidorovich NOSENKO, was a shipyard mechanic and an evening
student at the Nikolayevy Shipbuilding Institute. Shortly
.after NOSENKO began kindergarten in Nikolayev, in September
1934, his father graduated from the Shipbuilding Institute
and the family moved to Leningrad, where NOSENKO started
the First Class of school in September 1935. From 1935 to
/1937 NOSENKO lived in Leningrad where his. father was director
of a shipyard. In 1938 the elder NOSENKO became Deputy
People's Commissar of the Shipbuilding Industry and the
family moved to Moscow, where NOSENKO completed the Sixth
Class in June 1941 just as the war broke out.

_NOSENKO has given two versions of his whereabouts for
the next two years. In one, he said that on the outbreak
of hostilities he was enrolled in the Moscow Special Naval
School which was evacuated to Kuybyshev where he finished
the Seventh Class; thereafter he transferred to the Lenin-
grad Naval Preparatory School (which had been evacuated to

- 6001315

Tep Secret

(PRE-KGB. BIOGRAPHY)

Baku), where he finished the Eighth Class in spring, 1943.
In a second version [more probable since entry to the Moscow
Special Naval School required prior completion of the
Seventh Class] NOSENKO said that when the war broke out he
and his mother were.evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he
completed’ the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned
to Moscow afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the
Moscow Special Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he
completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall of 1943
NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School (then in Baku).

; After just six months in Baku, without completing the
Ninth Class, NOSENKO ran away from school and returned to
Moscow. =. - .

Comment: . NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran
away and fought on the front at Tuapse, and
that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku
and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the
Frunze Higher Naval School, the equivalent of
Annapolis. He has retracted both assertions.

7

NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the
Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval
Preparatory School returned to Leningrad from Baku, he
-Yesumed his studies there. Early in 1945, however, NOSENKO
” veceived a gunshot wound in the hand, and after being

os hospitalized for a month, he left the Naval school.

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute
‘course was of four years! duration and that he entered the
Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years'
duration and that because he failed a state examination he
was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'
duration and he graduated in 1950, on schedule; and that it
was of five, years' duration but “he failed an examination
which delayed his graduation for three months.

Comment: See p.367for report that NOSENKO joined the KGB
: upon graduation from the Institute in 1947.
The duration of the Institute course and the
date of NOSENKO's completion are materiai to
the plausibility of his claimed Naval RU service,
which he said followed almost immediately upon
his departure from the Institute.

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953)

- NOSENKO “claims” that upon completion of his studies at
‘the Institute of International Relations he entered the
Naval RU, serving in the Far East and then in a Baltic post,
finally successfully. "transferring" to the KGB through the
intervention of his father’ s friend, KGB General KOBULOV.

-to have “a small spot on a blood vessel under his collarbone"
and he was confined to the Hertzen Sanitorium outside Moscow

NOSENKO was offered an assignment to the Military-Diplomatic
Academy, but he rejected the opportunity because the
curriculum was almost identical to that of the Institute
from which he was graduated. :

; In summer 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to the Baltic city of
‘primorsk, "the former German city of Pillau". {[Baltiysk, a
larger city close by Primorsk, is the former German city of
Pillau.] There NOSENKO was involved in the formation of
"agent-observation posts", in which candidates from among
Soviet seamen were formed into three-man teams and trained
as stay-behind agents in the event of war. In early 1953,
after less than six months in the Baltic assignment, NOSENKO
returned on leave to Moscow where he met at his father's

Department. After passing the state examination on the

he received orders calling him to active duty as a junior
lieutenant. He also. received orders assigning him to the
Intelligence Staff of the Seventh (Far East) Fleet. He
‘left Moscow approximately .1.October 1950, travelling for
ten days by train to his unit, which was stationed near
Sovetskaya Gavan'. He was there assigned to a Reports
Section with duties which included translating American
naval publications and making summaries of Order of Battle
information of American naval forces in the Far East. A
radio signals intercept unit was connected with NOSENKO's
unit, but [contrary to what he asserted in 1962 and 1965] he
was not personally concerned with that unit's activities.

he reported to the Naval Ministry and was told to return

for reassignment at the end of his leave. NOSENKO was on
leave in May and June 1952, and he remained “at the disposal
of the Naval Ministry". [According to his 1962 and 1966
versions, he was hospitalized.during this period.]

In the summer of 1952 NOSENKO was offered assignments to
the RU Military-Diplomatic Academy, to a special Naval
espionage. school, and to a post in Germany, but he turned
them all down. He rejected the opportunity to attend the
academy, because he had had almost all of the courses
earlier at the Institute of International Relations.

"Sometime after his return to Moscow from Sovetskaya
Gavan'," NOSENKO completed the formalities to secure his
divorce from TELEGINA. [According to his 1964 account,

_NOSENKO visited Moscow later, from his Baltic assignment,
“to complete divorce proceédings.]

In August 1952 NOSENKO received an assignment to Sovetsk,
in the Baltic, where he arrived in early September 1952.
His assignment there was as a political officer, in which
capacity he was involved with sailors being trained for
. wartime sabotage missions. - His main task was to prepare the
training plan for. the.agents, to instruct them in such
subjects as “The Foreign Policy of the USSR", and generally
to see to their needs. NOSENKO did not care for his
assignment in Sovetsk and in December. 1952 he obtained leave
to spend the holidays-with his. parents in Moscow... In January ~
1953 NOSENKO and his parents visited KGB General KOBULOV
at the latter's dacha and KOBULOV, learning of NOSENKO's
dissatisfaction with the RU, suggested he consider working
_for. the KGB... 2. 2 1 . ; ~

After New Years in 1953 NOSENKO went "to rest for several
days" at the Hertzen “House of Rest", located 65-70 kilo-
meters from Moscow near Kubinka. There he met his second
wife, Lyudmila Yulianovna KOZHEVNIKOVA. {In 1964 and 1966

At the end of April 1952 NOSENKO left Sovetskaya Gavan‘
on leave, arriving in Moscow on 28 April. {Note earlier

and that he was permitted to return to Moscow because of
his father's birthday.] While on leave he became ill with
tuberculosis anil spent almost two months in May and June.

‘1952 in a sanitorium near Moscow.

During the month of July 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to
the Naval Intelligence Point of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet
in Sovetsk, in Kaliningradskaya Oblast (at the head of the
Bay of Gdansk}. Sovetsk was a small village located on
the spit of land between Kaliningrad and Baltiysk. [The
only Sovetsk in Kaliningradskaya Oblast is located many
miles inland from Kaliningrad, in the opposite direction
from Baltiysk. When NOSENKO was shown their locations on

- contemporary Soviet maps, he insisted that he was correct,

although Primorsk, where NOSENKO had said in 1962 that he
was assigned while in the Baltic, is located on aispit of
land between Kaliningrad and Baltiysk.] NOSENKO remained
in "Sovetsk". but a short time, and he returned to Moscow
at the end of 1952 to seek another assignment. Before

his departure he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant -

-of the Administrative Service. [In previous versions he

claimed to have become eligible for promotion and was
promoted while in the Far East, after less then a year's
service.] :

On 1 January 1953 NOSENKO and his parents were guests at
the KOBULOV dacha. NOSENKO indicated his dissatisfaction

with his RU assignment and KOBULOV promised to find him a

place in the KGB.

From the middle of January to the middle of March 1953
NOSENKO was under treatment at the sanitorium near Moscow
where he had been hospitalized in 1952, and there he became
acquainted with his second wife, Lyudmila Yulianovna

training nor indoctrination he was assigned initially to
the Far East for nine months or three years; there he
participated in agents' operational training, or reports
work. In the:latter capacity he was or was not involved
in RU radio signals intercept operations. He either never
_gerved in the Baltic or, if he did, it was for three
months or six months, during which he either participated
in agent training or was an administrative or political
officer. He was promoted to lieutenant in the Far East

Despite his claimed active commissioned service in the
Navy, NOSENKO knows nothing of Soviet Navy tradition,
doctrine, organization, or procedures. . He disétaims know-
ledge of RU. organization other than at the posts where he
served, "because of his junior rank". However, even at
those posts he describes neither the staff, the functions

in the Naval RU and of his date of graduation from the
Institute of International Relations). To the extent to

' which he has been consistent at all, he has cited March 1953
as the time of his entry to the KGB.

Date of Entry

NOSENKO at his: first meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962,
volunteered how and when he joined the KGB. NOSFNKO had
just returned from his Naval RU assignment in the Baltic,
he said, when he met KGB General KOBULOV and KOBULOV urged
him to join the KGB. NOSENKO stated that after completing
his processing, he reported for duty in the Embassy Section
of the Second Chief Directorate's American Department in
March 1953, “just after Stalin died". (Stalin died on
5 March 1953.) : ;

Comment: According to KGB defectors, the precise date

; : of entry to the KGB would not likely to be
forgotten by a KGB officer. The date is the
‘basis for computing length of service and is
a common entry. on KGB administrative forms
periodically filled out by KGB officers in the
course of. their service.

' According to NOSENKO in January 1964, he transferred to
the KGB from the Naval RU "in something like 1952", "just
after Yu. I. GUK transferred from the Second Chief Directo-
rate". i .

receive necessary forms. NOSENKO stated that he heard
notning further until after Stalin's funeral, waen he was
summoned to KOBULOV's office and afterwards assigned to
the Second Chief Directorate.

During the July 1965 interrogations NOSENKO retracted
his earlier claim that KOBULOV and his father had been close
personal friends. He stated that his father's relationship
with KOBULOV was not personal, and that KOBULOV had never
visited the NOSENKOs. : ;

In a biographic: statement written in April 1966, NOSENKO

-said that he had met KOBULOV but twice, once on 1 January

1953 at the latter's dacha, and the second and last time in
the elder NOSENKO's office as NOSENKO's father and KOBULOV
were departing. to attend Stalin's funeral. On that latter

- occasion, NOSENKO claimed, KOBULOV promised to concern him-

self witn NOSENKO's entry into the KGB and it was several

days later that NOSENKO was summoned ‘to KOBULOV's office‘
"and told ne was appointed to the KGB. ;

... Comment: General. Bogdan Zakharovich KOBULOV was a career

security official, but from the immediate post-
war period until after Stalin's death he was
not assigned to KGB Headquarters. As of 1952,
.he was posted to Germany with the Chief

: . Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad, then

no directly subordinate not to the MVD but to the
Council of Ministers and latterly to the ~
‘Ministry of Foreign Trade. Until he returned
from Germany in March 1953 to assume the
position of Beriya's deputy, he had no office
in KGB Headquarters. KOBULOV was arrested .
with Beriya in June 1953, and also later executed.

In light of the foregoing, it is improbable

that KOBULOV was instrumental in NOSENKO's
appointment to the KGB at the times NOSENKO
claimed. If KOBULOV ever interceded in
NOSENKO's behalf, it is probable that NOSENKO
would later have been purged after KOBULOV's

NOSENKO states that in March: 1953 he was already twenty-
five and a half years old, a member of only the Komsomol,
and that he had not been recommended for Party membership.
He further claimed that on entry to the KGB he became
secretary of the Second Chief Directorate Komsomol organi-
zation. .

Comment: Eligibility for Party membership, if not
; membership itself, is a requisite for KGB
appointment. By Komsomol statutes,of that time,
twenty-five was at that time the maximum age.
Thus, at the time of NOSENKO's claimed KGB
appointment, he was within six months of being
dropped by the Komsomol as well as still
“lunqualified for Party membership. He could
not have been. secretary of the Second Chief...
Directorate Komsomol. organization, as discussed
“on p. 338.

KGB’had his Naval RU file; that he was told that the KGB
would request the Naval RU file and meanwhile he was given
three copies of a four to six-page biographic form to complete

directorate, and the Second Chief Directorate, the counter-

NOSENKO claimed that he was promoted to the rank of senior
lieutenant in April 1953, shortly after joining the KGB.

_ Comment: All promotions in the KGB were frozen from the

: " time Beriya became Minister in March 1953
until late 1953, NOSENKO's actual sequence of
promotions has never been established. He has
also claimed this promotion occurred in 1952
‘and in 1954. See p. 351.

NOSENKO acknowledged that his qualifications for continued
_ KGB service were probably reviewed in connection with the
_ purges following both Staliri's death and Beriya's arrest, -
during which reviews numerous negative factors in his back-
ground would have come to light. He stated, however, that |

he could only.assume that the important and influential
position of his own father outweighed the negative factors.

exercised through KOBULOV, who was himself
arrested and executed.

KGB Entry: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO's assertiohs regarding the KGB in the 1953-1954
period throw no more light on the actual date of his KGB
entry than did his claims of when he transferred from the
Naval RU; the contradictions and inconsistencies are
interrelated.

It is possible that a former KGB officer, relating the
truth as he recalls it about events occurring ten years
earlier, could be inconsistent; that he could forget his
date of entry, not remember what administrative procedures
were, fail to recall the circumstances of the organization
-. he joined were, be inaccurate about what his. pay was, and
be vague on what his KGB identification document looked
like. Recognizing that administrative regulations and
procedures are on occasion honored in the breach, it is
also possible that NOSENKO was accepted by the KGB despite
‘the fact that he was the son of a senior official, that he
had tuberculosis, that he was unqualified for Party member—
ship, that he had been previously rejected and all at a
time when the KGB was not accepting new recruits. |
_. Zhe probability of these events being coincident, however,
“is remote. On examination, NOSENKO's latest admission, that

‘he "actually" entered the KGB in March 1953, is no better
. substantiated: than earlier accounts: citing other dates.

Conclusion

’ NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner nor at the
time he claimed.

Although able to identify correspondents in Moscow who were

then recruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this information
either in conversations with his superior {v.A.] KOZLOV or

at some point and in some undefined way after he no longer

was working against these targets. NOSENKO made clear that

he was not the case officer responsible for the more important
correspondents: "KOZLOV himself was working with_them, the

to determine w. ether. they had developed any important infor-~ -

‘replied:

"Tet us take the same case of (Snag ix6) I would

Information was also received according to NOSENKO from the
network of Soviet chauffeurs, cooks, language instructors,
and other agents in the Embassy; permanent and roving
surveillance patrols outside the Embassy; fixed observation
posts next to, acros$ from and near the Embassy; advance
notification of intent to travel by the attaches and their
itineraries; and reports from outside Moscow, including
surveillance, agent networks, the Militia, and the military.
The point of collecting and assimilating this information,
NOSENKO said, was to be able to know what the military
attaches were doing in Moscow and thereby to control their
intelligence collection activities. Far less important was
the goal of recruiting military attaches; NOSENKO knew of
only a. few instances when this was attempted, and all of
these efforts allegedly failed.

The KGB's principal interest in control rather than

. recruitment has been NOSENKO's explanation for knowing .little

about the backgrounds and personal lives of his targets--such
information, he stated, simply was not pertinent to the
primary mission of control. He has also used this explana-
tion to support his assertion that.there were no recruitments

* of American military personnel during this. period.

. .Comment: NOSENKO's agsertion that the KGB's mission was
to control rather than to recruit “American
: military attaches is contradicted by the
emphasis KGB tradition and doctrine place on
conducting operations against the United - .
States, the-"main enemy", in the KGB” parlance,
in this case American officials with access to
classified information, who were residing in
- the Soviet Unione 9 0 ee -

In the USSR, especially in the early 1950's ~
prior to the U-2 reconnaissance, the Service.
Attache travel program was the primary means -
by which the U.S. Armed Forces acquired intelili-
gence information on the Soviet Union's
military~industrial complex. The prevention
-or inhibition of this collection activity fell
consequently to KGB components concerned with
the security of military-industrial installations,

to the USSR from Australia in May 1954). NOSENKO asked
when the PETROVs defected in Australia; he explained that
he was not sure about KISLITSYN and could have given them
to another officer. “If KISLITSYN came [back from Australia}

Of the KGB agents among the chauffeurs, NOSENKO named
Nikolay SHNYRYEV, who was used by various attaches. "He
reported where they went, what they said, whether they took
notes or photographs, whether they had unusual packages
with them, and so on."

When viewing photographs (see below) in September 1964,
NOSENKO identified Vladislav VOROBYEV as his former agent
““"SERVIZNI¥". He had been working in the Embassy since its
establishment, starting first as a messenger boy and, in
. NOSENKO's time, performing clerical tasks. VOROBYFV had no
direct connection with the Army Attaches, and NOSENKO said
he himself did not know why he had been given VOROBYFV to
handle in 1954. The main function of this agent was
‘delivering to NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephone
listings of the Embassy, issued monthly.

_ "DMITRIYEV's" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV;
. NOSENKO’ saw this name on a 1962 phone list and thought, but
‘was not sure, that this was his agent. An electrician who
worked on the Embassy's electrical wiring systems and
elevator, "DMITRIYEV" reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires
and other wires he had observed on the top floors. Like
-VOROBYEV, "DMITRIYEY" had no direct connection with the
Army Attaches. - Se, a a ;

Comment: . Elsewhere NOSENKO described an electrician who
: _ provided some technical information on the
Embassy, but he related him to his second tour
_in the Américan Embassy Section in 1960-1962
and didnot then claim that the electrician. was
his agent. — poe . a

In September 1964 NOSENKO was shown a series of 260
biographic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American
Embassy in Moscow. Each card contained a photograph of the
person involved and short biographic notes, including his
name and job in the Embassy. The first time he went through
these cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see only the photo-
graphs; NOSENKO did not identify the photographs of SHNYRYEV

such an operation was assured. Before his transfer to the

Additional Reporting

Knowledge of another KGB operation involving Americans
was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in
the American Embassy Section, against CIA officer and
Embassy Security Officer Edward Ellis SMITH (see p. 37).
NOSENKO claimed to have personally participated in the
operations against E.E. SMITH in 1954-1955.° The incidents
which NOSENKO described, however, occurred in June 1956,
by which time NOSENKO, by his own account, had been out of
the American Embassy Section for a year and when he was
involved in the Seventh Department recruitment of [Richara (6
BURGI} His involvement in the [BURGI| case has been confirmed. ,

NOSENKO has also described the KGB recruitment of military
cipher machine mechanic "ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, see p. 33),
whose true name he claimed not to have known. He dated the
xecruitment as occurring "in 1949-1950" and "before he
joined the KGB", although he said that he knew of the :
existence of the agent during his first tour in the Embassy
Section in 1953-1955. However, NOSENKO also related that
“ANDREY" was recruited while Roy RHODES was in Moscow, that
RHODES "had spotted 'ANDREY'". "ANDREY" and RHODES ®ver-
lapped in Moscow from April 1952 to July 1953. "ANDREY"
fixes his own recruitment. as occurring in December 1953,
and until his departure in April 1954 he was responsible
for the entire Embassy code room. In that capacity "“ANDREY"
was a direct subordinate of the Army Attache cryptographic
security officer, NOSENKO's target /Army Captain Walter MULEL 6

| If NOSENKO served in the ‘Embassy SeCtion during 1953-1955

as he claimed, it is difficult to perceive how he could have
remained unaware of “ANDREY's" identity.

American Embassy Section - ca. 1953-June 1955:
Summary and Conclusion :

According to NOSENKO, immediately upon entering on duty
with the KGB he was assigned without training to what he
describes as the most sensitive and important section of
the Second Chief Directorate. There, after first handling
agents covering American correspondents resident in Moscow,

he was made the case officer solely responsible for opera-
tions against the commissioned officers of the Embassy's .
Army Attache office, until his transfer to the Seventh jl
Department. Alleging complete knowledge of all service

attache operations, NOSENKO flatly asserts that there were ;
no KGB recruitments of American military personnel during ‘
the period of his assignment to the Embassy Section.

Pertinent to the consideration of .NOSENKO's statements .
is his reluctance to discuss the 1953-1955 period, and his
‘inconsistent accounts of the dating and circumstances of
his entry into the Embassy Section, of his assumption of
responsibility as sole case officer for Army Attache tar- |
gets, and of his transfer to the Seventh Department. ..Al-"
though NOSENKO could plausibly claim failing memory to ex-
plain some areas of ignorance, he does not do so. Instead, |
he is positive and insistent that his statements about his
targets are a factual and complete account of what was then
known to the KGB. His assertion that the KGB was not in- |
‘terested in his targets' vulnerability to recruitment is
belied by his own statements as well as by the [MULE) case , 06
as he himself related it. He is uninformed about both At-
tache personnel and agent-informants who, by his own ac-
count, were his targets and his agents. - :

Conclusion

NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section
throughout the March 1953-gune 1955 period as he claimed.
Specifically, he neither entered the Section in March 1953
nor transferred from the Section in June 1955. In whatever
period he may have served, he was not the sole case officer
responsible for commissioned officers in the office of the
Army Attache. Unaware of many aspects of KGB activities
involving Army personnel and by his own account not involved
with either Air or Naval Attache personnel or diplomats,
NOSENKO has no valid claim to certainty that the KGB re-
cruited no American Embassy personnel during this period.

: ' then a substantial number of similar missions
had also been launched by American military
intelligence organizations and by the [British}||
and allied services.

It is a matter of fact, not of conjecture,
. that as early as 1957 a large number of these
tga ; agents were coming to the attention of the KGB
within the Soviet Union. Few were arrested,

Instead, all were surveilled, and some pro-

voked or entrapped, as the Second Chief

Directorate and its provincial KGB counter~ |

intelligence elements sought to identify the »

Soviet citizens with whom the American agents

were in contact, as well as the agents'
specific clandestine tasks. By the summer

of 1959 the KGB had obtained from its British

agent, George BLAKF, complete details of_the

objectives and methods of CIA and{B British .j

Intelligence tourist programs, together with

a number of case examples.

: It is within this context that one must

examine NOSENKO's claims to KGB service in

‘and consequent knowledge of Second Chief

Directorate counterintelligence operations

against American and British tourists in. 1955-

1960..

NOSENKO claimed he served with the Seventh Department
from June 1955 until January 1960. According to him, the
Seventh Department exercised counterintelligence functions
involving foreigners then visiting the Soviet Union,
including businessmen, seamen, foreign delegations and some:
ists, as well as the hotels and restaurants utilized by
visitors. He said that by 1958, however,. the number
reign tourists visiting the Soviet Union had grown
appreciably, and in June 1958 the Seventh Department
Tourist Section was split, and two new sections were created.

NOSENKO's Soviet Agents - ;

The Seventh Department Tourist Section, just established
when NOSENKO was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent ‘
network for operations against American and British tourists.
Consequently, HOSENKO said, he and the other case officers . :
had to "start from the beginning". ‘

As a first step NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow oe
officer to a number of “trusted persons" in Inturist. These
were not agents, he explained, but "just persons a KGB man
could approach with questions about somebody or something".
NOSLNKO collected information on these and others with the
aim of formalizing their recruitments. By the end of 1955,
he estimated, he had a network of about eight agents, all
of them Inturist interpreters. During the following four . j
years, the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied. : |
Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another,
some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of changing .
all the time, back and forth". In 1956, NOSENKO said, he
had about ten agents, in 1957 there were about twelve, in
ae 1958 about eight, and at the end of 1959 (when he was

preparing to return to the American Department) he had .
approximately twelve. The substance of NOSFNKO's descrip-
tion of his agents is as follows:

Larissa SOBOROVA - - |

one of the first agents recruited in 1955 by NOSENKO within

Inturist. She reported to him‘on all foreigners with whom

she worked as an interpreter. She worked with_NOSENKO when .

he served as a guide for British subjects [BIRSE] and| LANE inQh ol |
the summer of 1957. During 1957-1959 she Was involved and

possibly sexually intimate with American|travel writer OF U6

when she married and “retired". :

Nataliya SHULGINA

i SHULGINA was an Inturist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO
canes in 1955. NOSENKO knew that double agent Boris BELITSKIY |
{see p.282] “reported to the KGB that CIA had warned BELITSKIY
against SHULGINA". ; . :

Comment: KGB-controlled CIA.source BELITSKIY reported
to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB agent: CIA did
not warn him. SHULGINA was for two years the
secretary-interpreter of NBC correspondent
Irving R. LEVINE after his arrival in Moscow
in July 1955. She served as a guide for an
American musical troupe's visit in the USSR
in 1956 and in 1956 and 1957 she served as a
guide for American tourists in Moscow. According
to BELITSKIY, she.was involved in the sexual ,
‘entrapment and KGS recruitment of [British MP Ob
Tom DRIBERG NOSENKO's apparent ignorance of
SHULGINA's involvement with_LEVINE and other .
Americans, as well as with (DRIBER , and of herb
foreign travel, belies his claim at she was
his agent during the 1955-1958 period. Shown
her photograph in 1964, NOSENKO failed to
recognize it. ‘hen he was then given her name,
he. identified her not as his former agent but
just as a Second Chief Directorate agent once
involved with BELITSKIY.

‘eween. 1957 or 1958 and 1960 she was targetted against

NOSENKO, he was meeting with another KGB case officer.
DMITRIYEV accompanied a sports delegation to Norway anda
Soviet circus to Japan.

Comment: DMITRIYEV's travel to Norway and Japan in

statement he was aware of DMITRIYEV's
activities, but he was not his case officer.

(Fnu) IVANOV

Once a recruited agent in the Baltic area, when IVANOV
moved to Moscow the provincial KGB suggested he might be
of some use in the capital. IVANOV was a lawyer employed
by the Institute of Foreign Trade when NOSENKO became his
case officer. IVANOV was later turned over to the British
Commonwealth Department which "planted him in the British
Trade Mission or something like that". ;

Military Institute of Foreign Languages, where she studied
military subjects as well as foreign languages. When
NOSENKO became her case officer she was working as an

Soviet Homosexual A ents
eta Agents

The KGB operations which NOSENKO described commonly ©
involved sexual entrapment, Many of the Operations in
which he claimed a personal role involved the use of homo-
Sexual agents, KGB agents whose homosexuality was exploited
against susceptible male targets. ‘hile NOSENKO was never
their official case officer, in specific recruitment—
entrapment operations he worked with "LUCH", "NIKOLAYEV",
"SIBEYAK", “KOSHIKIN" and "STROYEV" (Victor BELANOVSKIY, b
used in the compromise of [Richard BURGI, VASSALL, and the
Canadian Ambassador WATKINS). He provided virtually no
personality information on them and usually could not recall
their true names. Two such homosexuals, ‘however, VOLKOV
and YEFREMOV, NOSENKO claimed were his own agents.

NOSENKO claimed to have re~-recruited VOLKOV, a former
agent (cryptonym “SHMELEV") and recruited YEFREMOV
(cryptonym "GRIGORIY") and. to have been their sole case

officer from the beginning of their KGB careers in 1957-

become too well known. He said he met them frequently,

and directed them in at least a dozen entrapment operations
or other homosexual encounters, NOSENKO claimed he took
them with him when he transferred to the American Department
in 1960 and back again in early 1962 to the Seventh
Department. : :

' YEFREMOV and vorKov

Because he had been seen meeting a foreigner in a
os public toilet in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded’
that A.I. VOLKOV- might be a homosexual and hence of some
Operational value. To verify this possibility in 1957, a
homosexual agent of the Moscow Criminal Investigations
- Department - provoked VOLKOV into a compromising situation.
Then VOLKOV, who had previously been a xcp agent but was
at this time inactive, was summoned by the KGB and, after
NOSENKO interrogated him, he admitted his homosexuality and
agreed to NOSENKO's Proposal to. work for the KGB among

homosexuals. VOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year to
recruit a homosexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronymic not
recalled) YEFREMOV. The two agents subsequently worked

as a team against foreigners under NOSENKO's direction; in
addition to specific targets, they had the general assign-
ment of associating with foreign visitors in Moscow for the
purpose of spotting possible homosexuals. NOSFNKO described
on 12 June 1962 his use of these agents:

"Although I am a chief of section there I
have all sorts of agents. I have a good agent
apparatus. I have beautiful girls, whom I can
use as I like. I have homosexuals, in particu-
lar, one special pair. JI am afraid they are
known to both you and the British... I permitted
this pair to work [without specific assignments]
on their own. I give them money and tell them
to go look around, but only Americans. Look for
American pederasts. They call me at night:
"Yuriy Ivanovich. There is a mister so-and~so
here.' I say: 'Well, let him [do what he
wants]. We'll-talk about it tomorrow.' So the
next day they go’ to a special hotel room. We
make photographs. Then we think about what he
represents. Is he worth it? Then, as Chief, I
recommend that he be recruited or not--depending:‘_
on his position, what he can give, what he can
tell. If he can give something, I say: ‘Well,
let's have a go [figrat].' After this, I speak
to these boys: 'Well, go with him again. Do
whatever is wanted.' All this is observed by
the KGB. The [hotel] administrator enters.
‘What are you doing?' The administrator calls
the Militia. An akt is drawn up. ‘Well, you
are a foreigner. “This is not our business. . We
don't know what to do.with you.' Then the Chief
arrives and a conversation ensues: ‘Listen,-
what shall we do? Pederasty is punishable by
three to five years and now, on the basis of
recent legislation, by up to eight. Understand,
if your friends find out that you are a pederast--
and how can they help but find out'..."

When NOSENKO moved from the Seventh Department to

the Second Chief Directorate's American Department in
January 1960, he took VOLKOV and YEFREMOV with him. They
were never used against targets in the American Embassy
but, NOSENKO said, the Seventh Department “used to call

me on homosexual prospects". VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued
as active KGB agents until some time in 1960_or 1961.

After they were employed once more lagainst[1j.B. goxunson} in UG
January 1962]. it was decided that they were oo well
known". NOSENKO claimed that the agents were retired and
that he himself sent their files to KGB Archives in 1962

or 1963.

NOSENKO's Soviet Agents: Summary

NOSENKO claims to have been these agents' case officer
for two to five years, during which he met each regularly,
assigned them operational tasks, and received their reports.
With the exception of YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, however, NOSENKO
can cite few instances of their operational use, and he has
but superficial knowledge of their personal backgrounds.

It is unlikely that this is merely the result of failing
recollection. He knows no more about the three whom he
claimed he took with him to the Embassy Section, where he
continued to be their case officer for two more years, than
-he does about the others. In the two instances where his |
agents were involved in KGB operational activity, NOSENKO |, ‘
is unaware of SHULGINA's work with LEVINE and|DRIBERG, andb
was not involved when KUNGAROVA_was targetted against and
married CIA agent Philip NIELSEN. NOSENKO's familiarity : |
ith the nine agents he named appears to be that which
would be acquired second-hand, not through personal contact
as he claimed. : :

With respect to YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, the evidence does
not sustain NOSENKO's claim that he was their case officer
in every operation from their recruitment in 1957 until
their retirement in 1962-1963. He is unfamiliar with either

“agent's background, He cannot say where either of them
lived or, indeed, how he got in touch with them when he
required their services. With the exception of the 7B. 06

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO stated that at the time of BURGI"s arrival in
the USSR, his file contained a copy of his visa application
(anketa), “maybe" an excerpt from a cable sent by the .
Soviet Embassy in the United States saying that a visa had |
been granted, a routine note from Inturist giving [BURGI!'s Ob
anticipated date of arrival and his itinerary insi le the
Soviet Union, and the results of file checks of the KGB
main-Archives and of the First Chief Directorate Archives.
‘ NOSENKO himself ran the file checks, which proved to be
negative; there was no information on record concerning
{b [BURGT, and since no other names were mentioned in the
Ob Raterial available [BURGI, no other checks were made.
pb The KGB interest in |BU Gl\ derived exclusively from the fact
§¥ that he was ja professor of Slavic studieS|and therefore
had contact With students who might eventually work for the
U.S. State Department, American Intelligence, and for other
target organizations. NOSENKO did not recall who first

suggested an attempt to recruit him.

when [BURGI| arrived in the Soviet Union, he came in :
contact with’ a number of KGB.agents, and their reports were
placed in‘an informal file maintained by NOSENKO. NOSENKO
could not recall how many such agents there may have been,
; their names, or what they might have reported concerning
(4(BoRGI\ ((BURGI] had an Inturist interpreter but NOSENKO did
: not Know whether he was a KGB agent.) From some source,
: name forgotten by NOSENKO, the KGB obtained indications that
_O5fBURGI\was a homosexual, and it was decided to try to obtain
grounds for recruitment by homosexual compromise. NOSENKO
therefore approached Yu. A. LOPUKHOV, an officer of the
British Department who handled the homosexual agent Viktor
BELANOVSKIY, and- asked permission to use BELANOVSKIY in
setting up the compromise. After permission had been .
received to mount an operation on this basis, LOPUKHOV and
L NOSENKO met with BELANOVSKIY and instructed him to make
e) {BURGI" s acquaintance in a hotel dining room. The compromise
proceeded according to plan: BELANOVSKIY met [BURGI, theo
fact of common homosexuality was recognized, and [(BURGI|was O6
invited to BELANOVSKIY's hotel room where homosexual acts
took place and photographs were made. NOSENKO was in the
adjoining room and directed the compromise, although he did
not meet [BURGI} at this time.

During the first conversation everything was made
completely clear... He was not at all willing to .

that he must understand that in this case "helping

Comment: In a 22 November 1957 interview with the FBI,.
QL {BuURGI) had recounted how he was compromised

June 1956. His version substantially confirmed
‘ that.provided eight years later by NOSENKO.

his acquaintance with Alexander KERENSKY.
on 25 May 1964 (BURGI] positively identified

junior of the two KGB officers who recruited
him. The other KGB officer (KOZLOV) was ‘the

NOSENKO's Information

The British subject |Sir alles LANE] travelled in the
summer of 1957 to the Soviet Union to visit various publishing
houses and brought with him as an interpreter [Arthur BIRSE). (6
The latter was of Russian extraction, having Iéft Petrograd
| (Leningrad) before the Revolution, and he served in| British 29
Intelligence} during the Second Yorld War. The case was
, handled by another. section of the Seventh Department, but
. O{ because of (BIRSEY s past, "some of our leaders decided that
it would bé good if one of our workers could approach him,
would get in on the case under the cover of the Ministry of
feta Culture, who would take care of this person, who would help
. him meet with all sorts of people representing our publishing
pee] companies. The choice fell to me. I was chosen for this
job." Taking along the KGB agent Larissa SOBOROVA as an
interpreter and using the alias "NIKOLAYEV", NOSENKO
(Oo accompanied BIRSE} and [LANE] in Moscow and Leningrad during
. -The only. object was to watch/BIRSE 0)

.their stay there.
because he was suspected of having an intelligence mission,
and no approach was made or contemplated. NOSENKO explained
that the use of the NIKOLAYEV alias with[ BIRSE] and (LANE |made(i(

Comment: That NOSENKO (as _NIKOLAYEV) took the trips is
corroborated by |British records, according to ||
which, a Yuriy IVanovich NIKOLAYVEV, born 30
October 1927, arrived at London from Brussels
on 20 August 1957. His visa application
described him as a member of a group invited
by the Light Athletics Association to partici-
pate in contests in London. He left on 27 :
August 1957. With the same name and date of
birth, NIKOLAYEV arrived again at London on
12 October 1958 with seventeen others, all
described as boxers. His visa application
described. him as an "office worker", but.on
his landing card, NIKOLAYEV was listed as a
boxer. He left London on 19 October 1958.

On neither visit did NIKOLAYEV attract the
attention of any(British security service} (9
While these trips are corroborated, they
are not material to NOSENKO's claims to have
served in the KGB positions he alleges he

held at the time.

tourists and tourist cover by Western intelligence services,
It was from this task that NOSENKO claimed he learned of
all the important arrests and recruitments among American
tourists as recorde by the KGB at the time.

Recruitment of [HARRIS | (1958)

NOSENKO's information /

NOSENKO in 1958 recruited Gisella HARRIS], an employee of
the} American Express Company in Salt Lake Cityl. The recruit-
ment’ was based on her romantic and sexual involvement with
a Soviet citizen, who told [HARRIS] that he was in trouble O€6
with Soviet authorities and persuaded her to accompany him.
to the police. (HARRIS! agreed to meet and cooperate with OG.
the KGB in[Salt Lake City), The case. was turned over to the(0
First Chief Directorate, and NOSENKO was unaware of any -
further contact with her.

Comment: {HaRRIs, a former German citizen, visited the

statements made to the FBI in 1958, the purpose
of her visit was to contact her former lover, .

[| Germany] in 1953. She hoped to persuade him-to
ivoreé his Soviet wife and marry her. She
described her recruitment by two men, one of
whom resembled NOSENKO. When shown a photo-
graph in 1964, she tentatively identified
NOSENKO as one of the men who recruited her
and said that, of the two involved, he "was
definitely the man in charge" while the other

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO personally and alone recruited the Moscow
representative of [British European Airways], whose name 24
-NOSENKO did not recall, at the Hotel Metropol in Moscow
during the summer of 1959, possibly in August. The approach
was based on homosexual compromise involving NOSENKO's
agents VOLKOV and YEFREMOV.

' NOSENKO explained that the Seventh Department in 1959
had a section dealing with commercial representatives, which
was responsible for the{ BEA|man. That section had asked
' NOSENKO's section for help.’>4

"They said they didn't have any agents or any-
thing and didn't know what to do. So somebody said,
‘Well look, why don't you ask the chief of the
section?’ He's a specialist on homosexuals and can
arrange everything for you.' So I wound up handling
the case, and TARABRIN (of the First Chief Direct-
orate) said I should report to him." :

Operational Activities - 1955-1960: Summary

According to NOSENKO, after an uneventful assignment in
the American Department's Embassy Section, in 1955 he was
transferred to the newly-organized Seventh Department
Tourist Section as a case officer. Between 1955 and 1957
he assembled. a network of agents and- was involved in four
KGB attempts to recruit_foreign tourists. One of these
attempts, that against ]Richard BURG], was the first recruit-06
ment of the Tourist Section; it won NOSENKO.a commendation,
brought him-to the attention of General GRIBANOV, and turned
NOSENKO into an effective and successful KGB officer.. In
1958 NOSENKO was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief

- of the American-British Commonwealth Section. He then —
recruited the second member of his two-man homosexual team
and, in 1958 and 1959, participated in ten KGB attempts to

i. xyecruit American and British visitors to the USSR and one
American resident of Moscow. NOSENKO's: success in the
: Seventh Department prompted GRIBANOV to transfer him back
. o the American Embassy Section as Deputy Chief with the
eryiical priority task of reviving KGB operations against .
rican Embassy code clerks. . : a

. It is worthy of note that of the fifteen cases in which
-he personally participated, by his own admission, NOSENKO
became involved in.nine not because they were operations of
his section, but because the targets were the victims of
homosexual or other entrapment. In addition, three of the
fifteen operations were not directed by his section, but:
by senior Seventh Department officers. According to his
own statements, four others were specifically the responsi-
. bility.of other Seventh Department sections of KGB elements,
including the Foreign Seamen Section (GEHRCKENS) , Delega~ (
Ol Dbtions Section [LANE and(3IRSH), Commercial Representatives

NOSENKO's Information
. NOSENKO's Tourist Study |

Sometime between May and October 1959, during the
tourist season, NOSENKO was ordered.to gather facts for —
“Second Chief Directorate Chief GRIBANOV. concerning the use

of tourist cover by foreign intelligence services during
the period 1955 through 1958. NOSENKO said he assembled
this material from the Seventh Department's annual reports

’ of the years 1955-1958, supplemented by information he

- obtained from discussions with knowledgeable Seventh

-, Department case officers. NOSENKO recalled only that the

“) study incorporated statistical data on the growth of
foreign tourism; he did not remember the content of the

- study, any examples included in it, ox what the study

- concluded about American or British Intelligence tourist

June 1959 a three-day conference was held in London between
CIA and MI-6 representatives, at the conclusion of which a

NOSENKO's description of the activities of the Second

almost solely restricted to his account of these fifteen
KGB operations. Other than to allege that certain KGB
officers he named were -his subordinates, he provided no
information to substantiate his Claim that he had any

description of the function of the Seventh Department's

wealth Section. Most were sexual or other entrapment

Operations, and he acknowledges that several were operations.

NOSENKO- ‘claims to. have served as Deputy’ Chief of the’

Second - Chief Directorate, from sometime in. January. 1960
until the first days of January: 1962... This:section, in ee

exploiting the knowledge they had gained of their targets.
During 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO said, within the section
special emphasis was placed on "identifying intelligence
officers in the Embassy and actively developing them,
acquiring ciphers, and painstakingly studying code clerks,
creating the basis on which they can be recruited".

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO said, he had
access to all information concerning its activities:
"Nothing was hidden" from him. On this basis, he expressed
certainty that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB recruited no
Americans associated with the Embassy, there were no KGB
agents. among Americans asSigned to the Embassy in this
period and, in fact, the KGB had recruited no American
Embassy personnel since “ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, recruited
ca. 1953, see p- 33). From continuing friendships with

- Ris fellow-officers of 1960—and 1961, who remained in the
section when NOSENKO transferred, NOSENKO has also claimed
certainty that there were no KGB recruitments from the

3 January 1962 until his January

time he left the section in
1964 departure in Geneva.

Transfer to.the American Embassy Section
— oo al ——

In December 1959, while serving as Deputy Chief of the.
American Section of the Seventh Department, NOSENKO learned
from the Department Chief DUBAS of plans to transfer him
back to the American Department's American Embassy Section,
as Deputy Chief. NOSENKO said he was opposed to the move
and wanted to remain in the Seventh Department:

"Tl was used to it there and wanted to continue.
I wanted to stay in the Seventh Department. This
{the transfer] was no promotion. Here I was the
Deputy Chief of section and would be the same
there. The American Department is, of course, the
most important. But here I was working against
American tourists. This is also important.
Furthermore, I showed [had proven] myself there in
55, '56, '57, '58, and '59 and was considered to

be not a bad case officer. And there, in the . , :
American Department, I must prove myself with new 4
people." ;

on 18 June 1964 NOSENKO was asked to list the names of
all officers who had either joined or departed the American
Embassy Section from the time NOSENKO was transferred to

the Seventh Department in 1955 to his return to the American
Embassy Section in 1960. NOSENKO listed fourteen officers
as having joined the section, and five who had been trans~

ferred out. In neither list did NOSENKO mention BAKHVALOV.

A week ‘later, however, on 24 June 1964 NOSENKO stated
that "in 1959 and possibly in 1958 Mikhail Fedorovich
BAKHVALOV was the Deputy Chief of the American Embassy
Section. 1 replaced him in his position in 1960 and he

went to the Fifth Department as Deputy Chief". In September
1964 NOSENKO asserted that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief, [not
the others he had identified earlier] had been LANGELLE's
case officer. In 1965 NOSENKO first mentioned that _
BAKHVALOV, not KOVSHUK, had been responsible for maintaining
the Embassy security file and stated that BAKHVALOV had. ;
shared with KOVSHUK responsibility for supervising code
clerk operations.

Comment: ° Interrogation has never resolved contradictions
; -between NOSENKO's earlier accounts of what
functions he assumed from. whom when he entered
the Section, and his belated assertions that
BAKHVALOV: was his predecessor as Deputy. Chief.

Responsibilities

Shortly after reporting for duty in the American Embassy
Section and following his short discussion with GRIBANOV,
NOSENKO said he met with American Department Chief KLYPIN
and Embassy Section Chief KOVSHUK to discuss his responsi-
bilities and functions in the section. Repeating what
GRIBANOV had said, KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's most
important single responsibility in the section would be
supervision of all KGB operational activity against American
military and State Department code clerks stationed in

Moscow. As for the other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN

. there were a total of-over three months when he said KOVSHUK
was 111 ox on leave. NOSENKO recalled that he was Acting

1961, although he did not remember precisely in which months.

a, He also served as Acting Chief for about a month in the

of KOSOLAPOV to the American Embassy Section in late 1959,
all operations against code clerks had been handled by
MALYUGIN, but during MALYUGIN's two years of effort there
had been no operational approaches and no successes. then
NOSENKO took over there were no active developmental.
operations against code clerks under way, he stated, and
the only agents or operational contacts being used against

whom had accomplished anything of importance. No non-Soviet
citizen agents were being used in Operations against code-
room personnel. . . :

According to NOSENKO, in January or February of 1960
GRYAZNOV was assigned to the American Embassy Section as a
second assistant to NOSENKO in his code clerk activities.

-From this point .on,. NOSENKO; KOSOLAPOV, and GRYAZNOV: shared

the same KGB Headquarters office, There, all KGB files on
American code clerks as well as the files on all agents

available for work against them, were stored in one large
safe accessible to all three officers. NOSENKO supervised

.all of the section's. work along these: lines, and no provo-

cations, compromises, recruitment attempts, or recruitments
could have been planned or carriéd out without his prior.
knowledge and agreement when he was in Moscow. If NOSENKO
was absent on a trip, he would have been told about any such
activity upon his return, :

‘NOSENKO said that he carefully directed the work of
GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV during these two years, discussing
their cases with then, taking part in operational planning,
and approving or disapproving all Operational measures.

GOLITSYN's Information About KGB Operations Against Embassy
: Code Clerks in 1960-1961 /

The most significant collateral information about KGB
Operations against American code clerks in this period,
with which to compare NOSENKO's assertions {on this topic},
is that provided by GOLITSYN after his defection in 1961.

GOLITSYN identified KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV by name and
from photograph as being two veteran KGB officers, personally
known to him, who were in 1960 "working against code clerks
in the American Embassy in Moscow." With respect to the
priority attached to the recruitment of American code clerks
in 1960, GOLITSYN commented in 1961 that: "The task of |
strengthening of work against Americans had been a standing
requirement, both in the past.and most particularly fin
1960]. This work was particularly intensified after the
appointment of SHELEPIN.to the KGB... In 1960, it was

“recommended in’ the KGB to intensify the work against the

Americans at the Embassy in Moscow, and against American

colonies in other, countries... This question of intensifying

work against the Americans was up before the Collegium of
the KGB. Thereafter there was a directive from SHELEPIN
regarding the intensification of work against the American

cipher-clerks."

_GOLITSYN said that NOSENKO was not assigned to the Embassy .
Section in 1960-1961, since if he had been GOLITSYN would —

have known about it. |

Preparing for his assignment to Nelsinki, GOLITSYN. in
the spring of 1960 visited the Embassy Section and learned ]
from GRYAZNOV that the latter had as an agent an Fmbassy
code clerk who was scheduled to be transferred to Helsinki.

pores

mation and he was considered by the KGB to be a "real"

agent. GOLITSYN was told by GRYAZNOV tnat if the code clerk's
transfer materialized, GOLITSYN might have him in Helsinki

as his agent. |

another attempt to recruit him if he ever returned abroad.

: STORSBERG |\did not report the KGB recruitment approach
until the NOSENKO lead prompted his being interviewed by
the FBI on 14 September 1964. His reasons, he said, were
that the KGB officers had warned him not do so and. he —
feared that by reporting the approach he would jeopardize
his chance for employment with the State Department. He
said that he provided-no information to the Soviets during
or after the approach in October 1961. With the exception
of the timing of the recruitment attempt, [STORSBERG!s Ob
account of the operation is fairly close to that provided by -

A proposal for the operation was prepared for the approvai
of the KGB Chairman which explained that code clerks were
assigned to Moscow usually only for one year ithus limiting
their accessibility to the KGB for development} and that it
was necessary to attempt’ to place an agent near them even .
before they arrived in Moscow. When the Chairman's approval
was granted, NOSENKO prepared the kharakteristika iofficial
form) on KOSOLAPOV for the trip and gave it to the Personnel
Office. KOSOLAPOV wrote a cable for Helsinki explaining that
he was coming for two or three days. NOSENKO didn't sign the
cable, but read it, and it was taken to KLYPIN for his signa-
ture and thereafter KOSOLAPOV took it to the Second (European)
Department of the First Chief Directorate for release. There
was no other correspondence with the Helsinki rezidentura
concerning the operation before KOSOLAPOV departed Moscow.
NOSENKO discussed the plan with GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV and
"maybe" they discussed it with KOVSHUK the day before
KOSOLAPOV left. KOSOLAPOV had (SENNER photograph and hisO6
name, and expected that the Hel inki° residency could obtain
a ticket for KOSOLAPOV. onf{JENNER!s train.c& NOSENKO did not

KGB/Polish UB Operations Against/ MORONE

‘At his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962 NOSENKO
Made a passing reference to an operation in which he had
placed a female Potisn UB agent in contact with an unnamed
American from the Embassy while the latter was visiting
Warsaw and later brought the agent to Moscow to further
compromise the American. On 11 June 1962 NOSENKO was asked
whether he had foreign (non-Russian) agents working against
the American Embassy, and he replied that he himself
introduced the idea of using such agents to develop
Americans afraid of becoming involved with Russian girls.
He had several such agents, he said, and he sometimes asked
the East German and Polish security services to supply him
with such agents, As an example, NOSENKO cited the case
of a Marine guard and a code clerk from the Embassy who
travelled to Warsaw. The code clerk was intimate with a
Polish female agent, whom NOSENKO had planted in their
train compartment, on the train ‘to Warsaw, and later in
.Moscow. — : :

: . In an FBI’interview on 24 February 1964 NOSENKO

: referred to the case again, and- when the names of code ,

Obeierk Joseph MORONE | and Embassy Marine guard(Frank BeGcs] DS
were mentioned, he immediately identified them as the men
involved. :

-German women who could be used against the residents of
‘America House.. One of these, Hanna, a blonde, was documented
as a West German. NOSENKO never met her but instructed
(PREISFREUND) (see the (STORSBERG) ase) to take her to America

House and Ieave her on her own. Hanna went several times to

she may. have reported on{MORONE].M The second East German
girl was documented as an Austrian, NOSENKO never met her
but he recalled that she was asked for her documents at _

replied that she had left them at her hotel, left America
House, and never returned. (NOSENKO did not remember the
time when this incident occurred, beyond the fact that he ;
was still in the Embassy Section and that. ABIDIAN was the
Embassy security officer at the time.)

From one of these agents Jer possibly in some other
Manner, the KGB learned that [Moron was planning to go on
leave in Warsaw. NOSENKO, KOSOLAPOV, and GRYAZNOV thereupon
decided to employ a Polish female agent in an attempt to
compromise him, KOSOLAPOV wrote the draft of the operational

KOSOLAPOV prepared a paper requesting that the girl again
be brought. to Moscow and permission to acquire compromising

by higher KGB authority. When the girl arrived, KOSOLAPOV
met her alone and took her to the Hotel Peking, to a

Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations:
' Summary and Conciusion

According to 'NOSENKO, on transfer to the Embassy Section, |
operations against the American code clerks .were the Section's
priority task and thus his most ‘important single responsibility
as Deputy Chief. He asserts to be complete his awareness of
what was known to the KGB on this topic at the time, because
of his senior. position, his personal review of relevant files

. and correspondence, his personal direction of KOSOLAPOV and
GRYAZNOV, and his personal participation in their operations. |
Without exception, in every one of the cases NOSENKO describes
there are facts substantially. at variance with his account,
in direct proportion to the amount of collateral information |
available. , .

Conclusion

From the foregoing it is concluded that he was neither
Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section nor supervisor of all
operations against American code clerks. Consequently,
he would not necessarily have known of recruitments among
other Embassy personnel.

officers stationed in New York and Washington
as well as among the Soviet delegations. One
of’the members of the Khrushchev entourage was
.KKOSOLAPOV, NOSENKO's subordinate in the Embassy
Section,

During his 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO mentioned
ABIDIAN in several instances, identifying him as the Embassy
Security Officer and as "a CIA officer" and describing his
letter-mailing activities. His knowledge of ABIDIAN was
attributed to his claimed position of Deputy Chief of the
Embassy Section.

After recontacting CIA in Geneva in 1964 NOSENKO for the
first time explicitly claimed to have been the KGB case
officer responsible for ABIDIAN in Moscow and for the first
time described ABIDIAN's alleged servicing of a deaddrop in
| 1960. NOSENKO has described ABIDIAN since 1964 as the sole
7 American for whom NOSENKO was personally accountable during
vi “his 1960-1961 Embassy Section service, and one of the most
ado. important counterintelligence targets of the Embassy Section
and therefore of the entire Second Directorate. :

was told by KLYPIN and KOVSHUK that one. of his duties would
be case officer for ABIDIAN, whose arrival in Moscow was
then expected in the near future. ABIDIAN was to be the
only American target for whom NOSENKO personally was officially
accountable while he served in this section. KOVSHUK gave
NOSENKO such information as the section had on ABIDIAN.
‘Included was ABIDIAN's visa application, the negative results
of checks of KGB Headquarters files, and a report prepared
by the American Department of the First Chief Directorate.

was generally reduced in order to allow increased coverage
of British targets in connection with the PENKOVSKIY case.
As the responsible case officer, NOSENKO directed the
surveillance of ABIDIAN and evaluated the operational
possibilities offered by information from surveillance
reports. :

In line with the emphasis on surveillance, the opera-
tional plan for ABIDIAN written by NOSENKO in October 1960
called for no direct action but specified that: oo

. “ABIDIAN's maid Tatyana FEDOROVICH, an "operational
contact" of. the Embassy Section, was to continue to apply
metka to ABIDIAN's clothing and "NEPTUNE-80" to his shoes.
(According to NOSENKO, these are surveillance aids. Metka
is a "thief powder" applied to clothing pockets, leaving a
trace on anything with which it comes into contact. Its
primary purpose is to-aid in the detection of operational
letters mailed by suspected foreign intelligence officers
and agents. NEPTUNE-80, applied to a target's shoes,
leaves a trace on the ground which the KGB even long after-
wards can follow with a dog.) The only item of information
received from FEDOROVICH was that ABIDIAN was having an
affair with an Embassy female employee. FEDOROVICH was

“unable to find personal mail or personal papers in ABIDIAN's

apartment. - .

-Pietro CECCHI, Embassy employee and KOSOLAPOV's
agent, was to try to cultivate ABIDIAN and report whatever

-he learned concerning him. CECCHI never obtained any

significant information on ABIDIAN's personal life.

‘“ABIDIAN was developing CECCHI as an informant on American

personnel at the Embassy", but NOSENKO did not recall any
specific report CECCHI gave to ABIDIAN that was of interest
to the Embassy Section, ae .

-Two Embassy chauffeurs were to apply NEPTUNE-80 to
the floorboards and foot pedals of ABIDIAN's car if.

-. necessary.

NOSENKO did not know the room number of ABIDIAN's office
in the Embassy or on what floor it was located, but he could
have checked, if necessary, with a copy of the Embassy tele-
phone list published monthly, since it contained the office
room number of each American employee. [The Embassy telephone
list contained apartment, but not office room numbers.]
ABIDIAN's office was in the "Zone of Security" (i.e., secure
office areas). _ NOSENKO said that a report from an agent
(identity not recalled) indicated that there was a sign on
ABIDIAN's office door which said "Security Office", (There ©
was no. such sign.] -NOSENKO was unable to determine if

. ABIDIAN had a secretary. No dictation was monitored in

ABIDIAN's office because no KGB microphone was installed
there, [In 1964 a microphone, albeit then. inoperative, was

- £ound in the room occupied in 1960-1961 by ABIDIAN.] NOSENKO

recalled no particularly interesting or important information
about ABIDIAN obtained from other microphones in the Embassy.

-NOSENKO did not know the location of ABIDIAN's apartment
in the Embassy building, nor how it was furnished, since
"data of this nature was not Operationally significant
unless the target had shown vulnerabilities or was under
active development". : ;

Aware that. ABIDIAN travelled from the USSR two or three
times while stationed in Moscow, NOSENKO did not know to
which countries he went or the time of year when the trips
were made. Such information would have been of interest to

. him as ABIDIAN's case officer since, like LANGELLE's earlier

trips abroad, ABIDIAN's trips were presumed.to be for

out by various KGB units, ; :

NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps. Even
if he were absent when such a request for travel was made,
he would have seen all documents upon his return; he did
not recall seeing any such documents in ABIDIAN's file.

Comment: ABIDIAN who is of Armenian origin and speaks
the Armenian language with a high degree of
proficiency, made a trip to Armenia between 5
and 9 October 1960. While in Armenia ABIDIAN
visited with various churchmen, their parish-
ioners and an Armenian who had repatriated from
Greece in 1946. ABIDIAN attended a service in
Echmiadzin celebrating the anniversary of the
accession ‘of the Katolikos VAZGEN I, and also
visitéd some relatives of his in or near the
city of Yerevan. After returning to Moscow,
an Armenian whom ABIDIAN met on that trip
tried to contact ABIDIAN at the Embassy, but
ABIDIAN refused to see him. :

‘After being told ABIDIAN had attended a
service celebrating the. fifth anniversary of
the Armenian Katolikos, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO
recalled that ABIDIAN had gone. to Echmiadzin
and that an agent: had reported a contact with |
him there. This agent, NOSENKO recalled, was
a priest or a monk, and the report concerned
only his conversation with ABIDIAN; the agent
had ‘no further contact with him.’ . NOSENKo said |
that this was his sole recollection concerning
ABIDIAN's trip... : oo.

With reference to ABIDIAN's travel to ]
Armenia in October 1960, NOSENKO recalied °
having. been on leave at the time. However,

NOSENKO's reconstruction of the timing of his
alleged leave still placed him in Moscow at
the time of ABIDIAN's trip. In 1966, NOSENKO
“stated that he had lied, that his 1960 leave
was taken in January, not October.

Comment: NOSENKO's information is substantially correct,
that no letters were mailed for one and a half
years after LANGELLE's expulsion, and that
ABIDIAN mailed two or three letters, including
ones to the Baltic area and to Odessa, No
letters were mailed from February 1960 until
ABIDIAN mailed one on 1 April 1961, and of the
three letters ABIDIAN mailed, one was to Odessa
and one each to Latvia and Estonia.

CIA has conducted tests to determine whether
a substance such as metka was being used as a
KGB control device. Ultra-violet, chemical
and microscopic analyses developed one possible
use of a metka like substance, Analysis of an
article of clothing of a foreign diplomat in
Moscow who served as a CIA support agent
produced a sharply positive reaction.

NOSENKO later described how metka was applied to ABIDIAN's
clothing by his maid and how, in particular, this. led to

the discovery f the letters ABIDIAN mailed to the agent in
__ Odessa and to his parents in the United States.

-"ABTDIAN!s maid in Moscow was Tatyana FEDOROVICH.
She was an operational contact reporting to ARTEMOV.
She started to work. for ABIDIAN a few months after
his arrival, perhaps three months but no longer than
six months after his arrival. I met her shortly
after she began to work for ARIDIAN in order to get
acquainted with her, in order to evaluate her and
give her general instructions about her work for
RBIDIAN. I do not know the exact date of this
meeting but it was before the fall of 1960. TI

October 1960. At this time FEDOROVICH was already
working for ABIDIAN. This operational plan stated

-ABIDIAN's Servicing of the Pushkin Street Deaddrop Site

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that in 1960
or in early 1961 the KGB had surveilled ABIDIAN visiting
what was believed to be a deaddrop site on Pushkin Street

in Moscow. He provided additional details when questioned

again in 1965.
NOSENKO's Information

In 1960 or early 1961, while NOSENKO was his responsible
case officer, ABIDIAN was surveilled from the Embassy to a
residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow. A KGB
stationary surveillance post at the Embassy saw ABIDIAN leave
with the Publications Procurement Officer of the Embassy in
a chauffeured automobile, rather than in the car he normally
used. ABIDIAN's surveillance team followed the car to a
bookstore. Both Americans. entered the bookstore, but
shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone and walked around the
corner, where he entered a residential building next to a
meat market on Pushkin Street. The surveillance team saw
him go in but did not follow him. ABIDIAN emerged after a
few seconds. This unusual incident was reported by the
surveillance team to the KGB Seventh (Surveillance) Direct-
orate, and the building was inspected that same day by KOZLOV,
the Chief of the First Department of the Surveillance -

_ Directorate, and MATVEYEV, the Deputy Chief of the Second

Chief Directorate's American Department. Taking into account
the character of the building and its inhabitants, the

- @uration and circumstances of ABIDIAN's visit, and the |

suitability of the hallway ~ particularly the radiator in
it - for use as a deaddrop site, it was decided by the leader-
ship of the Second Chief Directorate and the Survelllance

Directorate that a. ‘stationary surveillance post should
immediately. be set up; to cover this location. ° Because. of

.the short time available, it was not possible to place. this.

NOSENKO received no written reports on the results of the

stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss this matter
‘with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during the first month
of surveillance, and periodically after that. These discus-
sions took place either by telephone, when KOZLOV was
visiting NOSENKO's office, or when NOSENKO visited KOZLOV's
office in KGB Headquarters. From KOZLOV or perhaps someone
else, NOSENKO learned that the post had been discontinued
after 90 days. On the basis of these conversations with
KOZLOV, NOSENKO knew that nothing of interest occurred
during the period of the stationary surveillance.

NOSENKO was in the Embassy Section during all the period
that the stationary surveillance post was watching the
Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard from KOZLOV
that the post had been replaced by periodic inspections.

NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance on
the Pushkin Street deaddrop site to his CIA contacts in
Geneva in June 1962 because by that time the post had
already been discontinued without anything unusual or
suspicious having been noted, and he thought that this
incident would be of no particular interest to CIA.

When last asked whether he had visited the Pushkin Street
._ address several days after ABIDIAN had been seen there, as
the had earlier said, NOSENKO replied:

"I dontt remember. I do not want to say that I
visited the deaddrop. I don't remember now whether
I-visited it or not. It seems to me that I visited
it, but I don't remember. It seems-that I visited
it with KOZLOV, but I cannot say 'yes', and I cannot
say 'no'." ; : : . -

Comment: (Continued)
nor filed the initial surveillance report of
ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin Street site. If
he transferred to the Seventh Department two
days after ABIDIAN's visit, as he claimed (and
NOSENKO's participation in the([Tl.E. JOHNSON] case Ob
indicates that he was working against tourfsts.
by 5 January 1962), he could neither have visited
the site as he described nor could he have
received thereafter the daily surveillance
reports. He could not, of his own knowledge,
assert that the surveillance was terminated
after three months, since well before .the: three
months' surveillance ended he was abroad in
‘Geneva. Lastly, it cannot be for the reason
NOSENKO claimed (that the surveillance was
unsuccessful) that NOSENKO did not mention
ABIDIAN's activities to CIA in Geneva in 1962.

Case Officer for John ABIDIAN: Summary and Conclusion

If for no other reason than ABIDIAN's security functions
with the Khrushchev entourage, files of the First Chief
Directorate would record his name: If NOSENKO states to
the contrary, that traces were negative, NOSENKO did not run
the traces himself nor know the results. According to
NOSENKO, ABIDIAN was “one of the most important targets of
the Second Chief Directorate"; all KGB resources were
employed for two years, including 24-hour surveillance, the
exploitation of all agents with access to him, audio sur-
veillance, and technical aids, with amost absolutely negative

- results. The results could not have been negative: for

_ NOSENKO to so assert ‘can only mean that NOSENKO was not
informed of the results. In the two instances NOSENKO cited
of Embassy agents' activities against ABIDIAN, he made
fundamental errors: ABIDIAN's maid was not employed by
ABIDIAN-at the time NOSENKO insists she was applying the
metka, and GROMAKOVA taught ARIDIAN Russian throughout his

Stay - in Moscow, not just “several times". NOSENKO acknowledges

at his meeting with KLYPIN and KOVSHUK on entering the section
in January 1960, KOVSHUK suggested that NOSENKO assume super-
visory responsibility for the service attaches while KOVSHUK
supervised operations against the civilian diplomatic staff

case officers for the service attaches referred their ques-
tions to him, not to KOVSHUK. These included case officers
GAVRILENKO, responsible for Air Attaches, KURILENKO, for .
Army Attaches, and DEMKIN, for enlisted personnel of all
services. "While he was getting acquainted with the section
on DRANOV's retirement", NOSENKO himself took case officer
responsibility for the Naval Attache personnel. This res-
ponsibility was subsequently assumed by DRANOV's former
assistant, BELOGLAZOV. NOSENKO could not initially recall
how long he supervised service attache operations; he later
said "several months" and finally “five or six months".
Neither could NOSENKO recall what other pressing duty or
duties caused him to be relieved of this function. He said
this resulted from KOVSHUK's proposal that supervision of

the service attaches be assumed by ALESHIN who was Deputy
Chief of the Second Directorate's American Department and
coordinator for Second Directorate operations against
military intelligence officers of all nationalities.

Supervisor of Service Attache Operations:
' Summary and Conclusion
Because of the tardiness of NOSENKO's claim to have been
responsible for operations against service attaches and
because he was not able, when challenged, to substantiate
his claims by providitig any details of KGB activities against
these targets, it is concluded that this. aspect of his
claimed KGB service is a. fiction.

All Soviet employees of the Embassy who entered the
restricted areas, "the seventh through the tenth floors",
were carefully questioned because of the special KGB interest
in these offices. [The secure area barred to unescorted
local employees | is comprised of the eighth through tenth
' floors.]

NOSENKO personally placed some reports by KGB agents in
the Embassy security file, while he was custodian. None of
the information was of interest or important or useful
enough for him to remember, and he recalled none of the KGB
agent sources. [In another context NOSENKO cited an instance
in which an unrecalled KGB agent had reported f{erroneously]
that ABIDIAN's office had a sign on the door reading "Security
Office".]J

' Nothing could be recovered from the Embassy classified |
trash, which was always burned at an unrecalled location by
a non~commissioned officer or Marine guard accompanied by
an officer. [At the Moscow Embassy the Marine guard detailed
for the purpose has always burned the classified trash alone.
NOSENKO may be unwittingly referring to a U.S. military
security procedure requiring a commissioned officer to witness
and to certify, the destruction of classified documents. If
NOSENKO is aware of any such procedure, he has never indicated
. it: in any context. J Loe

In 1960- -1961, when NOSENKO was Deputy Chief, he either
knew the location of all offices and personnel within the
Embassy or he could obtain them from the monthly Embassy
telephone lists which the KGB received regularly from agents.
The lists gave office numbers. [The Embassy telephone lists
contain names, apartment numbers and telephone numbers, but
omits office room numbers. J:

In 1960 a “metallic chamber" {acoustical room) arrived
at the Embassy for President Eisenhower's use and for secret
conversations. None of the technical specifications of the
room were known, nor was its location. An unrecalled source
reported only that meetings were held in the room, which was
in the restricted area.

NOSENKO's Information

Handling of Monitor Reports

According to NOSENKO, only a limited number of KGB
personnel, all in the American Department of the Second
Chief Directorate, had access to the monitor reports. These
included Department Chief KLYPIN (but not his deputies),
KOVSHUK, NOSENKO himself, and GRIBANOV, to whom important
items were shown. The existence of the audio operation and
its product were concealed from personnel in other KGB
Departments. The reports were produced by the Second Special
Department of the Operational Technical Directorate (OTU).
The OTU Second Special Department has several sections, one
of which was the English Section under Colonel N. Ya. KUZMIN.
-KUZMIN's monitors, fluent in English, listened to and
transcribed the tape récordings. Their reports of the
_‘ preceding: day's product were brought daily by Tatyana
GRISHNYAT (of the Second Special Department) to the American
Department. (In some accounts NOSENKO has said that he
received the reports first, at other times that they went
first to KLYPIN.) NOSENKO reviewed the reports, marked
significant portions and usually within twenty-four hours
returned the reports to the Second Special Department.

_ In. NOSENKO's absence either KOVSHUK.or GRYAZNOV reviewed the
reports. The Second Special .Department. prepared sterile
abstracts of the portions NOSENKO had marked, abstracts
which disguised the source of the information contained:

the abstracts were returned to the American Department for
the reference of individual case officers in the Embassy
Section and for filing in the delo-formulyar (developmental
file) kept on each American employee in the Embassy..

Location of the. Microphones a.

In the 1962 Geneva meetings with CIA, NOSENKO emphasized
that the KGB was listening to all conversations of the
service attaches and particularly, to conversations held in
the office of the Minister Counsellor. In addition, he
referred to "points" [microphones] in the office of an
unnamed State Department employee, in the Agricultural
Attache office shared by BROWN and HORBALY, and in the
Embassy code room.

In 1964, at the second meeting with CIA, NOSENKO produced |
‘a handwritten note which he asserted listed all the micro-
phones in the Embassy which were operative in the years
1960-1961. NOSENKO. explained that at the-end of 1960 oy

NOSENKO said that "many" microphones were installed in
the chancery building before the Americans occupied it, but
he did not know how many were installed in all, how many :

-were in any particular room on KOVSHUK's list, or where they

“were located in specific rooms. He did recall that most of
the microphones were emplaced in the outside wall, the wall
nearest Chaykovskiy Street, as most of the offices faced
this street and microphones emplaced there were less vulner-
able to technical search and discovery. :

According to NOSENKO, there were no fixed microphones 1h
America House, the Embassy quarters of enlisted military
personnel. In 1960-1961 there had been a discussion of using
KGB agents employed there to emplace temporary audio devices
for one or two days at a time in the rooms of the Americans,
‘as well as in the Embassy garage- These plans were vetoed,
however, because of the risk of discovery. For the same
reason there was no attempt made in this period to emplace
a device temporarily in Spasso House, the Ambassador's
residence, or in the apartments of Embassy officers. The
_ KGB was afraid that they would be detected and there would
be a scandal. _ oe

Performance Characteristics of the Microphones

- According. to NOSENKO in 1962, the audibility of the
microphones in’ 1960-1961 ranged from very clear to zero,
but the microphone system was deteriorating. The KGB could
do nothing about it because they could not gain access to
the inside of the Embassy. Referring to the.microphone in
the Minister Counsellor's office, NOSENKO said that it was
becoming increasingly difficult towwork with its product.
The microphone was fading, and the recording tape sounded
as if "somewhere far away, somewhere in the cellar, someone
is speaking ina whisper". . KUZMIN, the KGB officer respon~
sible for the monitors, ‘said that soon the KGB could recover
nothing. Of the microphones then (in 1962) in place, about
twenty no longer were operative.

In 1964 NOSENKO referred again to the microphone in the
Minister Counsellor's office. NOSENKO learned from
DMITRIYEV [Deputy Chief of the English-language Section of
OTU Second Special Department] how difficult it was to

In 1962 while citing examples of the kind of information
the KGB obtained from monitoring, NOSENKO referred only to
the offices of the Minister Counsellor and of the service
attaches. According to NOSENKO, Counsellor FREERS dictated
Top Secret and Secret cables. If the content justified,
GRIBANOV was informed and he notified the KGB Chairman
immediately. FREERS ‘also dictated fitness reports on Embassy
personnel from which the KGB learned of various American
officers' personal weaknesses. With respect to the service
attaches, NOSENKO said that the KGB learned from microphones
where they intended to travel, and what they wanted to find
out: :

In 1964 NOSENKO provided some additional details. He
said that audio reception was good from the military code
room, but that the occupants rarely spoke, When one of them
“was monitored, the monitor report was sent immediately to
the Eighth Directorate which was concerned with ciphers. :
Nothing was obtained from the State Department code room and
teletype room because of the interference from the noise of
the teletype machines. The microphones in the apartments
produced rarely anything of interest. An exception was
advance information obtained of a social affair, for which
the English-language Section of the OTU Second Special
Department would be asked to pay particular attention. There
‘was a microphone with good reception in GLEYSTEEN's (a
political officer) office, but no secret information was
obtained. Similarly, the conversations were overheard in
the Agricultural Attache office, but nothing significant
was obtained except “something" which made the KGB suspect
HORBALY was connected with American Intelligence.

.In a protocol signed on 26 October 1965 NOSENKO summarized
his knowledge of the value of the information obtained by
the KGB via microphones in the Embassy:

knowledge aS to the effectiveness of United States operations
within the Soviet Union, particularly the military attache
collection program. Soviet knowledge of U-S. emphasis upon
certain intelligence collection areas has made it possible
for them to identify priority intelligence and probably
Soviet targets and thereby permitted them to implement
specific counteractions. The Soviets over the years must .
have amassed considerable information concerning the personal
habits, problems, attitudes and weaknesses of personnel
‘assigned to the Embassy which can be used by them for purposes
of exploitation at any time of their choosing in the future."

Col. Theodore F. HOFFMAN, Army Attache in Moscow from
May 1959 to May 1961 (a period coinciding with some eighteen
months of NOSENKO's claimed two years' service in the Embassy
Section), has been more specific. Interviewed by CIA, Col.
HOFFMAN recalled instances which the KGB, by monitoring just
the conversations held in his office, could have become aware
of the vulnerability of service attache personnel. As
examples, he cited the two occasions on which military code
pe clerk [STORSBERG| was reprimanded for absenteeism (unavailable
for cipher duties because he was elsewhere with “girl
friends"); HOFFMAN's conversations with America House manager

‘Ch eter BINDER (the personality probiéms, drinking ‘habits and

-the KGB attempts to recruit {STORSBERG| and (KEYSERS jb'"(The KGB
attempted later to recruit [BINDER?*as well.)] In summing up
his views, Col. HOFFMAN said: "To be perfectly frank, I

States relations (and hence of priority interest to the KGB),
as the U-2 and President Eisenhower's visit. Of the micro-
phones which produced useful information, NOSENKO describes
those in the Minister Counsellor's office, the office of

the Army Attache, and in the code room; when challenged to
cite examples of information obtained, he-asserts that none
produced any information of interest to the Embassy Section.-
Lastly, although he stresses the value of the chancery :
microphones as sources of information on which he rdied to
direct operations against code clerks and other Embassy
personnel, he again can describe no actual instance. In

the single case in which he asserted that he relied on
information procured from microphones. (KEYSERS! failure to0b
report receipt of the defection invitation), he was in error.

Conclusion

From the foregoing it is concluded that, NOSENKO's claims
to the contrary, his information on the chancery microphones
does not sustain his claim either to have been Deputy Chief
of the Embassy Section, or his claim that he personally
reviewed the KGB microphone monitoring reports. :

Cryptologic Attack on Embassy Communications

As former Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section of the
American Department NOSENKO claimed to be knowledgeable of
the extent of KGB success in its cryptologic attack on
Embassy communications. He has consistently asserted that
the KGB had never succeeded in reading enciphered communica-
tions of the service attaches [for which reason he claimed

in the information as it did not relate to agents or agent
activities. NOSENKO noted, however, that the material ;
concerned messages from the Secretary of State to the American
Ambassador, Moscow. All of this material was highly sensi-
tive, and few people were permitted to see it or even to

know of its existence. NOSENKO stated that it was treated
more carefully than Top Secret information.

Unable to describe the techniques of the KGB Eighth
Directorate in breaking U.S. Department of State crypto-
graphic systems, NOSENKO nevertheless did indicate methods
as known to him. One method, mentioned by NOSENKO on
12 June 1962, stemmed from the habit of certain Embassy
officials (notably Ministers Counsellor FREERS and McSWEENEY)
dictating the text of outgoing cables aloud. When the texts
were picked up on the KGB microphones, the Eighth Directorate
compared them against enciphered traffic intercepted by
other means.

NOSENKO has referred to the Eighth Directorate's interest
in equipment sounds and snatches of technical conversations
picked up by the microphones in the State Department and
military code rooms. :

"Now, we also listened to the code room and the
teletype office, but we could never get anything out
of the teletype office because of interference
[equipment noises which drowned out conversations]. b
In the military code room--that was where {Games H.)0

didn't get much. We could hear[STORSBERG)\ swearing(j,
on occasion, and then he would mention a group of
numbers. This was, of course, all recorded and we
turned it over at once to the Eighth Directorate,
dealing with coding and decoding. Of course, all
other intercepts were turned over to them also."

With respect to the use of code clerks by the American
Department, NOSENKO recalled that in 1948 or 1949 the KGB
was helped a great deal by {James H.] McMILLAN {a military
code clerk of the Embassy staff who defected in 1948], and
by “ANDREY" [Dayle SMITH, see p. 33]. It was thanks to

| Cryptologic Attack on Embassy Communications:
; Summary and Conclusion

From USIB and’ NSA damage assessments following the
discovery of the microphones in the chancery, it has been
concluded that it was equally feasible for the Soviets to
have recovered plain text (by analysis of Cipher machine
emissions) from enciphered service attache traffic of the
period 1952-1962, and from enciphered State Department
traffic during 1952-1959, “ANDREY" (see Pp. 33), the code
machine mechanic the KGB allegedly recruited in 1953,
serviced the cipher machines in a common State~service
attache code room; his access was not limited, as NOSENKO
indicates, to State Department traffic. On the basis of
these fundamental errors, it is concluded that NOSENKO
was not knowledgeable of the extent of KGB cryptologic

attack on Embassy communications, and that such information

as he provided can not be related to his claim to have
been Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section.

Knowledge of CIA Personnel within Embassy

As Deputy Chief and occasional Acting Chief of the
American Embassy Section, NOSENKO claimed that he would
“necessarily know whom the KGB knew or suspected to be a
CIA officer" under diplomatic cover within the Embassy.
Within the section,. “special emphasis" was placed on the
‘identification and development of. American Intelligence.
personnel, with the objective of an eventual recruitment.
The KGB believed that the Ambassador, code clerks, and
Marine guards would not be used to perform intelligence
missions: any diplomat, however, was noted as "suspect

whether or not he had read GARBLER's file. -(It will be

Knowledge of CIA Personnel in Embassy:
ummary and Conclusion

With the exception of ABIDIAN, there is a paradox
connected with each of NOSENKO's identifications, as is
most evident in the cases of MORELL } and GARBLER. It is a 6.
fact that both these individdals wére known to the KGB as
CIA officers, a fact of which NOSENKO apparently is unaware.
His claim is thus false, that he would necessarily know
whom the KGB believed was a CIA officer, and to the extent
he related it to his claim that he was Deputy Chief of the
Embassy Section, that latter claim is unsubstantiated.

Personal Handler of KGB Agents

NOSENKO has named seven agents which he claimed to have
handled while Deputy Chief of the American Section during
1960-1961. . ; .

YEFREMOV and VOLKOV —

‘NOSENKO continued to manage these two. homosexual agents
whom he had recruited and managed during his assignment in
the Seventh Department, and brought with him when he trans-
ferred to the American Department (see p.1ll). They were
used in no operations during the period 1960-1961. [NOSENKO
described the compromise of Robert BARRETT) in 1959 and knew ()6
of his later recruitment in T961., (See p. 134.) NOSENKO
does not know of|BARRETT|'s contacts with YEFREMOV and voLKov Ob
in 1961, when he Glaims to have been their case officer.]

Personal Handler of KGB Agents: Summary and Conclusion

Of the five agents NOSENKO claims to have brought with

him to the American Embassy Section from his previous Seventh
Department assignment, none was used operationally during

1960-1961. If NOSENKO handled LEVINA as he claimed, he

would presumably know that his single agent in the Embassy

served throughout his Embassy.Section assignment and_was

not fired earlier, as he asserted .(>(PREISFREUND] and[ WEISS] ()(
are discussed in.considerable detail7in connection with .
the KGB operations against (STORSBERG and (ZUJUS).(4 NOSENKO's
claims regarding the agents he handIed during the 1960-1961
period do not sustain his assertions that he was Deputy ~
Chief of the American Section, responsible for code clerk
operations, or provide conclusive evidence that he did or
did not serve in the Embassy Section. :

Travel to Cuba (November-December 1960)
ee a (Aovember—becember 1960

When NOSENKO first mentioned his travel to Cuba (in
1962, in Geneva), he claimed that he travelled under the
NIKOLAYEV alias, and he provided colorful details of his
activities in Havana in surveying the American Embassy
there for operational possibilities. In subsequent versions
NOSENKO asserted that he travelled in true name, and that
his was a routine assignment to accompany a Soviet delegation
as a security officer, . :

NOSENKO's Information
In the latter part of 1960, at the same time as he was

preparing for his intended trip to the United States, a
special delegation of nickel industry experts from Gosptan,

-the Soviet State Pianning Commission, was preparing for

departure for Cuba. The delegation was a routine one,
consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of
the Soviet Uninn. Since there was no one under any sort of
suspicion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abroad) Depart-
ment of the Second Chiéf Directorate decided it was unnec-

- essary to include a security officer. Two days prior to

the departure of the group, however, the Central Committee |
of the Communist Party ordered that a Second Chief Direct- ‘
orate officer accompany the group. Because of the short

time remaining before the delegation's scheduled departure, ©

the Eleventh Department protested that it would be impossible |
to find a suitable officer who could get his necessary

travel documents ready in time. At this point, A.I. KUZNETSOV

of the Eleventh Department stiggesSted NOSENKO, who had been |
supposed to go to.the United: States and who had “a valid :
passport (in true name). The Cubans issued NOSENKO a visa.
immediately as did The Netherlands a transit visa. : |

NOSENKO's functions with the delegation were purely of
a security nature. He flew with the delegation to Cuba in
October or November and spent about a month and a half |
there. During this time he accompanied the delegation

NOSENKO was travelling on a service passport;
he did not enjoy diplomatic immunity. It is

described as he claimed,
NOSENKO's planned trip to the United States

Comment: NOSENKO doesn't know why he was selected to
consult with the MVR in Bulgaria. As far
as is known to CIA, such consultation was a
function of the KGB advisors in Sofia whom
NOSENKO himself described. The American
Legation (after a ten-year absence) reopened
in February 1960. By 1961 the MVR had demon-
strated that it had lost none of its earlier
demonstrated efficiency in controlling the
activities of resident foreigners and in
establishing the basis for mounting operations
against American diplomats. There was no .
apparent necessity for NOSENKO's Sofia assign-
ment, and therefore his account is judged to
be untrue. :

a O&
Compromise of| LUNT | —
Ob In Geneva in 1962 NOSENKO described the compromise of

(ont in graphic, terms, including his own personal confron-
ation of (LUND In his subsequent accounts he had stated

'” ‘pbthat while he“never saw [LUNT) personally, he supervised the

activities of the MVR officérs who dealt with LUNT}
; Oks

About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around the
end of April 1961, NOSENKO was reviewing MVR lists of
foreigners scheduled to visit Bulgaria, when he came across
the name of\Horace G. LUN). NOSENKO recalled that a Slavic
linguist of ‘that name had7been reported to him in Moscow by
VOLKOV' or YEFREMOV-as a possible homosexual. When MVR al
officers confirmed that this[LUNT] was a Slavic specialist, U6
NOSENKO decided to check his’ ¥ecollection against KGB
records, for which purpose he telephoned Moscow. _An almost
immediate reply confirmed that this was the same (LUNT] who DG
had visited Moscow previously, and that he was a Homosexual.
(The KGB had never exploited its knowledge of[LUNT!'s homo-. (6
sexual activities and the MVR had not known that LUNT |was OG
a homosexual.)

NOSENKO's involvement in the [LUNT case is

CHAPTER VIII

SEVENTH DEPARTMENT {January 1962 to January 1964; —

Comment :

By late 1959 or early 1960 the KGB had the
complete substance of the CIA and MI-6 tourist
agent program in the USSR. The information eb-
tained from the KGB agent in MI-6, BLAKE, in-
cluded accurate details of the objectives and
targets of those Operations, as well as the

. Practices employed for the selection, recruit-

ment, training and briefing of the agents in-
volved. As a probable consequence of reports
received from BLAKE as well as by the indepen-~
dent confirmation of tourist agents identified
in the USSR, the KGB by 1961 was mobilizing all
of its resources to counter the threat. The
KGB's tasks were made no easier by the increase
in bona fide tourists to the Soviet Union, the
numbers of which were increasing by thousands
annually. Evidently uncertain of the success
of domestic measures it was taking, the KGB |
extended responsibility for countermeasures to
KGB elements outside of the Second Chief Direc-
torate. To that end, selected First Chief
Directorate residencies abroad were instructed
to exploit all of its facilities ‘in developing
tourist agent countermeasures. In describing ~
the magnitude of its tourist agent problem,
KGB Headquarters cited the scores of American
tourist agents who had been identified in just.
one year in the’ Soviet Union.

In fact, by the time'NOSENKO returned to

‘the Seventh Department. in January 1962, the

threat against which the KGB was deploying had
passed. By early 1961 the tourist agent pro-
gram was suspended when technical collection
programs and cther agent Operations made the
use of tourists unnecessary. — .

Comment: (Continued) . ‘
tourists during this period must be examined
in light‘of the foregoing facts. Since NOSENKO
claims to have held key KGB positions from
which vantage he asserts he was particularly
well informed about KGB operations against
American tourists, it is appropriate to hold
him closely accountable for his statements. -

NOSENKO's claimed assignment to the Seventh Department,
first as Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section
and then as a Deputy and then First Deputy Chief of the
entire Department, extended from January 1962 until his de-
fection in Geneva in January 1964. By the time NOSENKO re-
turned to the Seventh Department for this assignment, the
KGB reorganization of 1959 had been completed, and according
to NOSENKO, the Department was divested of all of its former
functions unrelated to tourists. A newly~created Service
‘sluzhba), NOSENKO explained, assumed responsibility for
foreign religious figures, emigres visiting the Soviet Union,
and persons: travelling to the USSR to visit relatives. The
Seventh Department's former responsibilities for operations
against foreign seamen, commercial delegations, and so forth

"were similarly transferred elsewhere.

In addition to performing supervisory and administrative |
duties, NOSENKO asserted that in this period he personally
was involved with KGB operations launched against six Ameri-
can tourists and participated in investigations of Lee Harvey

_ OSWALD and of a disaffectéd KGB colleague from the American

Embassy Section, A.N. CHEREPANOV. In this period, also, he
travelled on two occasions to Geneva on missions unrelated to
his Seventh Department. duties. : ae 7

[Johannes PREISFREUND |

The KGB considered (PREISFREUND)\ compromised to American
Intelligence after GOLITSYN's defection (in December 1961) and
thus unsuitable for further use against Americans at the Em-
‘bassy in Moscow. For this reason, NOSENKO was told to take

partment. “As the agent spoke only finnish dna Russian, however,
he was of no use against English-speaking tourists. NOSENKO

VOLKOV and YEFREMOV

Acccrding to NOSENKO, he used the two homosexual

agents in the entrapment of |W.E. JOHNSON\ several days after 06
returning to the Seventh Department. This was their first
operational activity since 1959, because they were employed

in no operations during the entire period he was their case
officer while assigned to the Embassy Section. After the
JOHNSON) entrapment , these agents were not used again. NO- |

ENKO claimed that in 1962 or 1963 they were retired, and he
personally dispatched their files to KGB Archives. {For

Until -1960 or 1961 a Greek language instructor at the
Institute for International Relations, RYTOVA obtained a job
at a CPSU Central Committee school and thereafter ceased all

tain his claims to service in the Seventh Department in this

WOHNSON\ became acquainted with_VOLKOV and YEFREMOV at the
Metropol Hotel. They told JOHNSON that they had recently ar-
rived in, Moscew and invited [JOHNSON to visit their-hotel room. .
0° Gounsow] agreed because "they understood each other right away.
ey knew they were the same (i.e., homosexuals)." ‘Under the
guise of the hotel administrator and a militiaman, KGB offi-
; cers burst in on the trio.- Photographs of the incident had
4 been taken (but had yet not been developed). A report. :
; ‘describing the circumstances (an akt) was prepared and [sounson} ) 6
: was then transferred to another room. By this time NOSENKO
had arrived_at the hotel from his office and he went into the
room where [JOHNSON was being held.

ObThe “militiaman" described what had happened to NOSENKO,
in GOHNSONs presence. Addressing (GouNsON PeNOSENKO said?
"How come? How could you do such a thing? What are we going
to do now? After all, this is punishable by court and...people
are given from five to eight years for such relations. It
used to be three to five, now it's from five to eight." :
Frightened? (JOHNSON wrote out and signed a promise not to
criticize thé Soviét Union in the future.
The following day, after the incriminating photographs had
been developed, NOSENKO approached [JOHNSON in the cafe of the %6
Metropol Hotel and asked him whether he intended to keep his
promise. When (JOHNSON said that he planned to do so, NOSENKO O64
presented him with an envelope containing copies of the photo-
graphs and said _that they would be released to-the foreign
vopress if\| Jor ON were to break his promise. The KGB later
6éblearned at [gomsoi nad visited (or phoned, according to a
later~version) the Atherican Embassy and the KGB thus assumed
that he had reported the approach. NOSENKO did not recall .
what name, if any, he had used during this operation.

In 1965 NOSENKO dated the entrapment operation as having
occurred in summer in either 1962 or 1963. _ Reminded that his
“notes paired [JOHNSON smame with the date of 5 January 1962,
NOSENKO insisted that the date had nothing to do with the
name, that he recalled the operation as having taken place in
summertime. [NOSENKO ultimately accepted 5 January 1962 #s
the date of [JOHNSON s entrapment, since it occurred “immediai ly
after his transfer back to the Seventh Department. ]

Comment: From their modus operandi the "doctor from
; Riga" is undoubtedly VOLKov and the "student"
YEFREMOV. NOSENKO frequently used the opera-
tional pseudonym Yuriy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV
and was called Georgiy. 6 :
’ Although JouNson} appient ly confirmed
NOSENKO's rote, NOSENKO's version of the case
is incompatible with what must have been the
actual time frame. According to NOSENKO's
version, within five days of founson}' s arrival (6
in Moscow the KGB had discoveréd that he was
a homosexual, concluded from “two or three"
censored letters that he was a threat, and ar-
xanged his entrapment. The rapid pace of ;
events suggests that JOHNSON}! s homosexuality O06
was already known to the KGB (if not to NOSENKO; .
Qo before [FoHNSON!'s arrival in Moscow. NOSENKO's
oh lgnoranée of JOHNSON] s preaching {probably the
actual cause of KGB concern) is further evi-
dence that NOSENKO did not know the complete .
background of the KGB Operation, and that his
role was merely that of playing the "Police
Chief".
: NOSENKO's participation in this case con-
tradicts his assertions about the timing of
his transfer from the American Department.

In addition to his general security duties with the
delegation, NOSENKO said in 1962 that he was given a
special assignment to check on a senior delegation advisor,
Pavel Fedorovich SHAKHOV (see below).

During the 1965 interrogations, NOSENKO provided somewhat
varying accounts of the background of his 1962 trip to Genevs.
He said that GRIBANOV had nothing to do with his assignment,
but that [S.G.] BANNIKOV, the Deputy Chief of the Second
Directorate who supervised the Soviet Delegations Abroad
Department, made the selection. The. latter department was
investigating SHAKHOV, and BANNIKOV was concerned with the
selection of a security officer because SHAKHOV, who was
suspected of being a Western agent, was to be in the delega-
tion. Because of the seriousness attached to the case, the
Delegations Department wanted a chief of section as case
officer, and when a request was made to the Seventh Depart-—
ment Chief, CHELNOKOV, the latter agreed to NOSENKO's as-
signment. NOSENKO stated that CHELNOKOV, his superior and
friend, let him go to Geneva as "a treat", even though he
had just assumed his duties as Chief of the American-
British Commonwealth Section, he had no deputy,.and.the trip
was occurring on the eve of the tourist season. :

_ Investigation of SHAKHOV

According to NOSENKO, M.G. SITNIKOV, representing the
Soviet Delegations Department, conducted investigations of
SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but had been unable to resolve the
KGB suspicions about him. Because of the failure of these
early efforts, the KGB decided to send.a "senior guy" to the
Disarmament talks in 1962, and NOSENKO was chosen "to finish
things up". Before leaving Moscow in March 1962, NOSENKO
discussed the SHAKHOV case with SITNIKOV and with. LYALIN, the
Soviet Delegations Department. case officer in charge of the
SHAKHOV case. He also read various materials on the case,
including an investigative plan drawn up by LYALIN, -

NOSENKO has said that SHAKHOV was under suspicion in 1962
because he was working with different delegations at different
conferences, and there was some evidence that in Geneva ear-
lier he was somehow connected with American diplomat (David MARH),

- Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to
the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for
more than a day or two, Legal Rezident S.I. GAVRICHEV would
invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself.
GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated him with deference,
and shortly after his arrival in Geneva in March 1962,

NOSENKO gave a lecture on counterintelligence to the assembled
members of the Legal Residency. This lecture was given at
GAVRICHEV's request, although it was only after some hesita-
tion on the part of the Legal Rezident that all of his subor-
dinates were brought together to hear NOSENKO. In return

for helping the Legal Residency to perform countersurveillance
on several occasions, NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed
by GAVRICHEV to have the use of an operational car and driver
to go shopping and carry out other private errands. [NOSENKO

“was not under CIA surveillance at any time in 1962 in Geneva

and his claims as to his activities there, aside from his
meetings with CIA, can be neither confirmed nor refuted.]

NNOSENKO claimed that he would know of any others, and he

‘was the sole KGB officer within the Soviet Disarmament Dele-

gation in 1962. Among delegates he identified only Oleg
GRINEVSKIY as having any connection with the KGB. GRINEVSKIY
was one of NOSENKO's own agents within the delegation: in
Moscow he was..handled by KGB officers of the Intelligentsia
and Correspondents Department of the Second Chief Directorate.
Among other delegates NOSENKO described A.K. KISLOV and V.G.
FILATOV. According to NOSENKO, KISLOV was head of the Ameri-
can Section of TASS and was. "a genuine correspondent"; “"de-
finitely not an intelligence officer". .

. the delegates as KGB officers. ‘KISLOV was ob-

Association with Other Soviets |

According to NOSENKO, the Soviets he saw most often in
Geneva in 1962 were A.K. KISLOV (see above), Yu.I. GUK, and
M.S. TSYMBAL. (Both KISLOV and GUK were involved in the
“ANDREY" case: see p. 33 .)

A.K. KISLOV

TASS correspondent KISLOV was one of the three other -dele-
gates besides NOSENKO staying at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva.

. NOSENKO said he arranged for KISLOV's name to. be given as a
notional source of information on Soviet disarmament policy
to KGB ‘double agent BELITSKIY (see below). NOSENKO drank
and caroused with KISLOV while in Geneva, and KISLOV was

pe NOSENKO's. companion in early June, when NOSENKO either —

_— squandered or was robbed of KGB operatdonal funds. [the lcss
he asked CIA to make good], and on the night of 10 June, when
he squandered the 2000 Swiss francs CIA provided on wine and
women, With reference to the threat posed his security by

_. KISLOV's knowledge of his profligacy, NOSENKO said that KISLOV |

was “too drunk to know what was going on", and in any event
constituted no threat. : oe :

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that KISLOV
had been a KGB operational contact while stationed in the:
United States and that NOSENKO had been introduced to KISLOV
by a KGB officer in Moscow prior to’ departing for Geneva in i
1962, so that he. could use KISLOV at the conference. On the

‘basis of NOSENKO's favorable report afterwards, he said,
KISLOV had been recruited as a KGB agent on his return.

In 1966 NOSENKO named the Soviets living with him at the
Ariane Hotel in 1962, but did not name KISLOV. :

NOSENKO. did not actively participate in the case until he
received in Geneva a cable from Moscow directing him to give
advice to the young and inexperienced case officer V.L. ARTE-
MOV. ARTEMOV had not worked on the BELITSKIY case in Moscow
either; he also had been sent to Geneva to work on counter-
intelligence matters and only to direct BELITSKIY df the Ameri-
cans should.contact the agent. BELITSKIY had been “inserted"
in a World Health Organization Delegation in the hope that CIA
would "find him". ~

As a result of that KGB instruction, NOSENKO jcined with
ARTEMOV in directing BELITSKIY's meetings with the latter's
_American case officers. BELITSKIY Was first met™in Geneva by

the American case officer "Bob", and later by "Henry", who
was “called out from the States". BELITSKIY noted that the
‘name on the door of the apartment where he met his American
case officers was not the. same as that of the person whose
apartment it was alleged to be, and that the apartment itself
had an “un-lived-in" look. ‘

When the American case officers asked BELITSKIY whether he
could establish contact with a Russian on the Disarmament
Delegation, NOSENKO advised ARTEMOV not to use anyone from .

.the Soviet Foreign.Ministry. NOSENKO proposed instead that
BELITSKLY claim to get information from the head of the :
American Department of TASS, A.K. KISLOV. The information,
of course, would be (disinformation) furnished by the KGB.
In case the Americans would check, NOSENKO and ARTEMOV ar-
ranged for BELITSKIY to be introduced to KISLOV.

The KGB believed that CIA had accepted BELITSKIY's bona
fides. From the. KGB viewpoint, however, while BELITSKIY was
not a bad agent, he was apt to go too far sometimes, and "add
.things on his own". For this reason, the KGB limited BELIT-
SKIY's time spent with CIA, to lessen the chance that the
agent might. say something which would cause CIA to sense that
he was a plant. :

: involvement with American tourist agents in
1958 and 1959, during a period when NOSENKO
claims to have been Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Départment's American Section.

Under interrogation NOSENKO did not know
how, when, or where the BELITSKIY operation
started, did not know the nature of (ritish)||
involvement, did not know the operational -
tails and contact arrangements BELITSKIY had
with CIA, did not. know BELITSKIY's pattern of
activity in Moscow or in Geneva, and did not
know the alleged objective of the KGB opera-
tion, e.g., the substance of the "disinformation"
which BELITSKIY was to provide CIA.

From the foregoing it is concluded that
NOSENKO did not exercise any supervisory func-
tion in the BELITSKIY case.

Contact with CIA '

On 5 June 1962 U.S. Foreign Service Officer [David MARK|
reported to CIA in Geneva that he had been approached by a
Soviet citizen whom he believed to be Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO,
a member of the Soviet Disarmament Delegation. NOSENKO had

-merely suggested that they get together for a talk on the

following day.. In late afternoon on 6 June, -NOSENKO told

(MARK) privately that he would like to talk to(MARK] as soon as U6)

possible. He was "not going to pump him for information", but
“simply wanted to tell him some things". A luncheon meeting
was arranged for 9 June, although NOSENO indicated that he
preferred an éarlier date.0b MARK] advised CIA of: the appoint-
ment and commented that the approach seemed so unusual that

it might be an offer of cooperation or defection.

At the 9 June luncheon with MARK} NOSENKO identified him-
self as a counterintelligence officer sent to Geneva to ensvre
the security of the Soviet delegation. He knew that MARK) had Di
previously served in Moscow and [erroneously] believed him to

_tute in’Geneva,: and offered for this amount to sell.two items.

the identity of.an American, a former employee of the Embassy.

audio surveillance operation against the Embassy in Moscow.
Among foreign agents of the KGB NOSENKO identified Canadian
Ambassador WATKINS (see p. 23 ) and described a British Ad-

_ Miralty employee (William VASSALL, see p. 30 ). He talked
freely of his activities in Geneva, including his association
with KGB officers there, his visits to the KGB residency

and his security duties with respect to the Soviet delega-
tion. NOSENKO seemed to CIA to be what he claimed: a KGB
officer with personal knowledge of important and sensitive
KGB operations. ‘He described his education, his service in

'. the Naval GRU, his entry into the KGB and the general func~

tions and operating techniques of the various components of
the Second Chief Directorate in which he had served, along
with the approximate dates of his service.

Ultimately the only restriction which NOSENKO placed on
his cooperation with CIA was his refusal to permit communica-
tion with him in the Soviet Union. He was willing to meet :
.with CIA representatives during future trips outside the
Soviet Union, which he estimated would occur about once every other
year. He said he would not consider defecting except in cir- .
cumstances in which his personal security was endangered,
citing as reasons his devotion to his wife and children (and
fear of KGB reprisal against them if he fled), his widowed
mother's dependence on him, and his love of Russia:.and the
.. Russian people. oo : : :
NOSENKO promised to contact CIA and arrangements were

was promoted to the position of a (one of three) Deputy Chief
of the entire Seventh Department. A year later, he was made
First Deputy Chief, and thus second-in-command to CHELNOKOV
and general supervisor of all Second Chief Directorate tourist
operations. The Seventh Department, which had a strength of
about. 100 KGB officers, was responsible for all operations
against tourists in the Soviet Union. From this period NOSENKO
claimed to have learned, either. by virtue of his position as |
Deputy Chief of otherwise, of a number of KGB operations
against Americans, including two arrests, one recruitment, and .
investigations of a suspected FBI agent and of Lee Harvey
OSWALD. NOSENKO as well attributes to his senior KGB posi-
tion during this period his knowledge of an American GRU agent
- and of the KGB investigation of a disaffected American Embassy
Section officer, the latter occurring just before NOSENKO re-
turned to Geneva for the second time, and defected.

Arrest of BARGHOORN

At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO
described the provocation and arrest of Yale Universit
Professor Frederick BARGHOORN in late 1963. NOSENKO's
most comprehensive statement, from which the following
paragraphs wete largely drawn, was made on 9 June 1964,
NOSENKO said that the purpose of the KGB operation
against BARGHOORN was to retaliate for Persona non grata
action taken against three Soviets in New. York City in
the case of John W. BUTENKO {in November 1963] and to
secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet (Igor
IVANOV) in the BUTENKO case who was jailed. (NOSENKO
had asserted in Geneva, earlier, that the operation
against BARGHOORN "was to discourage future arrests
such as that of IVANOV, not because of any special im-
portance of IVANOV himself." :

NOSENKO's Information

In 1963 four KGE First Chief Directorate officers
assigned to the New York Legal Residency were caught in
Operational activity in the United States. Of the four,
three had diplomatic immunity, but one was a chauffeur

and had only. a service Passport. The three Soviet

diplomats were held three or four hours by the American
authorities and then released. IVANOV, the chauffeur,

was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity. .
GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,
learned of this arrest probably the next day and was
directed by KGB. Chairman Semichastnyy to take "necessary _
measures." GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office ‘
NOSENKO; A.G. KOVALENKO, Chief of the Seventh Department;
and G.I. GRYAZNOV and Ye. M. RASHCHEPOV from the.

. American. Department. After describing the arrest,

GRIBANOV asked what information the Second Chief
Directorate Departments had on any American, Embassy
employee or tourist, that could serve as the victim of
an {retaliatory] arrest. RASHCHEPOV and GRYAZNOV said
that at that very moment there were three or four
American Service Attaches in Rostov and that, in the
opinion of the American Department, these officers might
be carrying electronic apparatus. It was known that they
had cameras, that they had been taking photographs, and
they had been-observed taking notes. They could be
arrested in Rostov before they took the return plane to

 GRIBANOV instructed the two’ representatives of the -;
- -American Department to write a report on what other
. “possibilities existed. He also told. them to request .
° permission. to. arrest and, search: the Service ‘Attaches.

7  GRIBANOV. ‘then: asked what. pertinent: information was —

wy Returning: “tothe: ‘Seventh’ Department, NOSENKO - ‘ana who

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving
"naterials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow. NOSENKO said that
this would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that
this made no difference. He instructed NOSENKO and
KOVALENKO to locate an agent who could be used to pass
the compromi'sing material to BARGHOORN and told them
to write a summary of BARGHOORN's background with a
proposal that the Second Chief Directorate arrest him
‘when he obtains materials which are of interest to
american Intelligence." This was to be sent in letter
form to Semichastnyy over GRIBANOV's signature; the
letter was not to indicate how BARGHOORN was to receive
the materials. (That the evidence was to be planted
was not to be mentioned.)

GRIBANOV took a one-page letter on BARGHOORN, along
with a similar letter from GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV
concerning the Service Attaches, to Semichastnyy. While
the four -- NOSENKO,. KOVALENKO, GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV ~~
were waiting in GRIBANOV's office for his return,
GRYAZNOV received a telephone call from the Rostov KGB
organization informing him that the Service Attaches
were in the air on their. way back to Moscow. Shortly
thereafter, GRIBANOV returned with the news that the
Chairman of the KGB had approved the arrests of the
Service Attaches as well as BARGHOORN. Khrushchev was
absent from Moscow at the time, but Semichastnyy had .
called BREZHNEV and secured his approval.

_ When. GRIBANOV. learned from GRYAZNOV that the Service
Attaches were already. on their way back to Moscow, he-
became furious and sent. GRYAZNOV out "to do the job or
die." Meanwhile,. arrangements were made with the -
"Department D" (the :KGB. element responsible for ..dis-
information, subordinate. to the First. Chief Directorate).
to provide materials on missiles which could be passed
to BARGHOORN. While these were being picked up, NOSENKO
and KOVALENKO returned to their office to plan the arrest.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance
upon his arrival in Moscow. At 1810 hours a radio
message wes received from one of the surveillance cars
that BARGHOORN had gone to the American Embassy, and it
was decided that the agent (name not recalled, aged 25
to 30 years) would be placed in contact with him as soon
as he came_out. The KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appoint-
ment with \ORCHARD of the British Embassy| at 1900 hours, £24
but at 1900 hours a report was received hat BARGHOORN !

the missile documents.) The first sessions
concentrated on general matters, such as
BARCHOORN's life history.

after oné and one half hours of questioning
BARGHOORN agreed that the materials were on him
when he was arrested, but he maintained that they had
been placed on his person. He said that he thought
they were "newspapers Or something," that he did not
know what they were. The package was then opened and
shown to BARGHOORN; it contained about 20 to 25 pages
of information on missiles. "BARGHOORN was not, of
course, given a close look" at the materials.

Following BARGHOORN's admission, another declaration
was drawn up by KRUPNOV. and signed by KRUPNOV,

directed that all materials on BARGHOORN, including
information from KGB Archives, be given to the KGB”
Department of Prosecution so that they could begin
legal proceedings against BARGHOORN. After this, all
interrogations were conducted by that department;
KRUPNOV was dropped from the case; although YEFREMOV.
continued to act as interpreter.

Comment: BARGHOORN'’s version of his, entrapment,
arrest, and interrogation coincide fairly
‘precisely. with. the version provided by -
NOSENKO. He identified NOSENKO from a
photograph as a KGB officer present at
one stage of the interrogation on the
“second day of his arrest and said
NOSENKO took some part in the pro-
ceedings. He recalled NOSENKO as being
“clever and quick-witted" and as "giving
the impression that he was not a dedicated
careerist, but opportunistic and adaptive:
he seemed not to care about what he was
doing, but doing a good jop nevertheless."

Although the KGB considered it possible that OSWALD

might be an American agent, the KGB did nothing to
investigate this possibility because "this would be

done after the person is allowed to stay in the Soviet
Union." Surveillance of OSWALD was not increased after
his request, and OSWALD was not interviewed by the KGB

in an attempt to establish his intentions. KRUPNOV

sent NOSENKO, his chief, a memorandum on information

which had been received concerning OSWALD. The memorandum
cited reports by KGB informants at the Hotel Berlin, where
OSWALD was staying in accordance with an Inturist itinerary
and a two-page report by the Inturist interpreter to whom
OSWALD made his initial request to remain in the Soviet
Union. A file incorporating all information which KRUPNOV

had collected was thereupon opened in NOSENKO's section.

From this: information NOSENKO and KRUPNOV. concluded
that OSWALD was of no interest to the KGB, and both agreed

-« that OSWALD appeared somewhat “abnormal." For this reason
-, NOSENKO. instructed KRUPNOV to advise OSWALD through the

Inturist interpreter that he would not.be permitted to
remain permanently in the USSR and that he. must depart on’
the expiration of his visa, then seek re-entry. as a’

. permanent resident. through normal channels. at the Soviet |
.Embassy in Washington. KRUPNOV followed NOSENKO.'s' orders,
and either that day or the néxt NOSENKO. learned that OSWALD
“failed to appear for a scheduled tour. arranged by his :

‘Inturist guide. ‘This prompted a search, and.after several
hours, OSWALD was found in his hotel room, bleeding heavily

_ from self-inflicted wounds. After hearing of this incident
from KRUPNOV, NOSENKO then reported it to K.N. DUBAS, Chief

Of the Seventh Department. NOSENKO believed that DUBAS in
turn reported it to GRIBANOV, head of the KGB Second Chief -

_ Directorate, GRIBANOV upheld NOSENKO.'s. original decision

that the KGB..should not become “involved with. OSWALD and:
that OSWALD should not be permitted to remain in the USSR. —

| There was no attempt to. debrief OSWALD because "he was
not an interesting person and wasn't normal." OSWALD was
never questioned on his past nor asked to write an auto--
biography. :

OSWALD never received any KGB training or KGB assign-
ments. If any other department of the KGB or the GRU had
wanted to use OSWALD in any way, it would have had to secure
permission from the Seventh Department, -which originally
opened his case file. In view of OS"IALD's apparent mental
instability, no Soviet intelligence organization, particu-
larly not the Thirteenth (Assassination and Sabotage)
Department, would have considered using him. KGB Head-
quarters did not maintain a control file on him following
his settlement in Minsk, as it would have done had OSWALD
been of any operational interest. The only KGB record on
OSYALD maintained in Moscow was an index card giving his
‘name and the fact the Seventh Department had originated a
file concerning him.

The KGB maintained no separate file on Marina OS!WALD;
‘all information about her was kept in OSWALD's file. There
was no indication in OSWALD's file that the KGB had had any
- interest in Marina either while she was in the Soviet Union
or after she left for the United States. .

Comment: NOSENKO later told CIA on one occasion that he
“only skimmed the file" and on another that he
had it in his possession about 20 minutes. In
October 1966 he again said that he read the
file and that while doing so he saw a picture
of OSWALD for the first time. NOSENKO added
that he never met OSWALD personally. -. ;

NOSENKO's assertion that the KGB First Chief
Directorate first learned of OSWALD when he
applied for a re-entry visa in Mexico City in
September 1963 is probably incorrect. The
consular file turned over to the U.S. Govern-
ment by the Soviet Embassy in Washington
‘after the assassination indicated that the KGB
First Chief Directorate would have known of
OSWALD as early as February 1963 if not earlier.
That file contained Marina OSWALD's letter of
February 1963 and a letter of July 1963 from

yO At his first meeting with CIA in January 1964 NOSENKO

" related how a disaffected former KGB colleague, A.N.

/ . CHEREPANOV, had stolen documents from the American Embassy
‘ ' Section and in November 1963 sent them through an inter~ |
mediary to the American Embassy. CHEREPANOV's treason was
discovered, NOSENKO said, when the Embassy returned the
documents to Soviet authorities. CHEREPANOV fled Moscow,
and NOSENKO claimed to have taken part in the KGB search
for him. NOSENKO brought with him to Geneva the official
KGB document which authorized his travel in the search for i
CHEREPANOV. ,

The significance of the CIEREPANOV incident is twofold. : |
The KGB documents which CHEREPANOV allegedly sent to the

Embassy appear to have originated in the American Depart~ 7

ment's Embassy Section,. and the documents relate to KGB .

modus operandi, personnel,.targets, and technical devices |
employed in operations during 1958-1960, during part of

which time NOSENKO claimed he was Deputy Chief of the-

Embassy Section. The KGB document, the "temporary duty : |
authorization", is an item of physical evidence NOSENKO
_has offered to substantiate his claim to personal parti-
‘Cipation in the CHEREPANOV case and to having held the rank
of KGB lieutenant colonel. [The document does not itself
xefer to CHEREPANOV in any manner.] — , nee : :

NOSENKO's Information

The KGB officer, A.N. CHEREPANOV was born about 1920 or:
1921, During World War II he was a KGB officer working
with partisan groups behind the lines. Later he was in :
Yugoslavia for four or. five years, and was probably Deputy:
_ Chief of the KGB Legal Residency in Belgrade. | .

Comment: CIA records contain references to an Aleksandr -
os Nikolayevich CHEREPANOV, a Soviet diplomat and’
suspected intelligence officer in Belgrade in
1953. CHEREPANOV left Belgrade in 1956. A
Yugoslav intelligence officer who defected in
1957 confirmed that CHEREPANOV had been an
intelligence officer.

When the American Embassy saw the CHEREPANOV documents,
they were afraid that the documents were part of a KGB
provocation, and they wondered what the Russians were
trying to do. The Embassy officials photographed the
documents and on the next day returned them to the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. When the Americans gave the documents
to the Ministry,.the KGB wondered why the Americans gave
them back.

The whole matter was held very tightly in the KGB during
its investigation for 20 or 25 days. When the KGB examined
the documents, some were found to be in CHEREPANOV's hand-
writing, but no documents were found which pertained to

-CHEREPANOV's own case work, or. that of the American Embassy

Section. The KGB found no documents dated later than
1961--none for 1962 or 1963--only 1959, 1960 and 1961. Thus
there were a number of indications pointing towards
CHEREPANOV, who had left the section in 1961. The KGB did
not dare alert him by putting full-time surveillance on him,

_but instead mounted fixed surveillance posts at his home and

office. In order to provoke CHEREPANOV into some precipitous
action, a former KGB colleague was sent to visit him. who, in
the course of- conversation, mentioned the great disturbance
in the KGB caused by someone passing stolen KGB documents

' to the Americans. CHEREPANOV manifested no reaction to the

newsand was quite cool about the matter. The next day the
surveillance .post observed him leaving his house in the
morning at his usual time, apparently on his way to work,
but the surveillance post at his office soon reported that

‘he had not arrived at work. He had "simply dropped out of

sight".

An intensive search “all over the city of Moscow" ensued,

. then spread throughout the Soviet Union: Border controls.

were tightened, photographs of CHEREPANOV were sent out to

~Republic.and local.KGB and militia offices, and all.means.

of transport | were covered. Reports began coming in from
various places that someone who seemed to fit CHEREPANOV's
description had been seen acting suspiciously here and there.
Reports which came into KGB Headquarters from Gorkiy Oblast
strongly indicated the possibility of CHEREPANOV's presence
there, so NOSENKO was dispatched to the area to check.

Contents of the CHERFPANOV Package

The KGB documents in the CHEREPANOV package totalled .-
103 pages in the original Russian version, divided almost
‘equally between typewritten reports in final form and hand-
written draft reports or notes, plus two copies of letters
written by Soviet citizens to the American Embassy. The ~
longest single document was a 33-page Top Secret report,
dated 18 April 1959, entitled “Operational Conditions in |
the U.S.A. and the Activities of American Counterintelligence
Organs against Soviet Installations and Soviet Citizens in
the U.S.A. in 1957-1958", The report was signed by Colonel
A. FEKLISOV, [alias FOMIN, the former KGB rezident in
Washington]. whose title is given as "Chief, Pirst [American]
Department, First Chief Directorate". The rest of the |
documents refer to KGB coverage of various American Embassy
and American diplomats in Moscow during the period August
1958 to 15 October 1960. Most of the documents were prepared
by or for one senior case officer of the Embassy Section, ;

had left the Soviet Union, Edward L. KILLHAM, Second Secretary

Comment: NOSENKO has never provided a satisfactory
explanation for his retention of the document
nox for bringing it to Geneva. According to
an earlier KGB defector, the bearer of a
temporary duty authorization is held strictly
accountable for the document which has to be
turned in with the financial voucher. What-
ever NOSENKO's purpose, the effect of presenting
the document to CIA was to corroborate his
statements about CHEREPANOV and substantiate
his claim that he was a KGB lieutenant colonel.
NOSENKO was not a lieutenant colonel (see p.350).
When he eventually said in 1966 that he was

- only a captain, NOSENKO was challenged to
‘..exphain how he came to possess an official KGB
document signed by General GRIBANOV and
identifying him as a lieutenant colonel.
NOSENKO asserted that it came about "by mistake".

Return to Geneva (January-February 1964)

NOSENKO was detailed a second time to perform security
escort duties with the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament
Conference, and he returned to Geneva in January 1964 where
he resumed contact with CIA and announced his intention to
defect. He brought with him a considerable number of hand-

“written notes to which he referred when describing to CIA.
- officers KGB. operations of which he claimed he learned at. .
KGB Headquarters during 1962 and 1963. His delegation
security. duties were not onérous. | He visited the Geneva
Legal Residency daily and met with CIA almost as frequently ~
while awaiting approval of his defection and exfiltration -
from Switzerland, tentatively scheduled for some three
weeks later. .A little more than a week after his arrival,
however, NOSENKO declared that he had to defect at once,
because he had received cabled instructions to return to the
USSR immediately. On 4 February 1964 NOSENKO was taken from
Switzerland to Germany, and on 12 February he was brought
to the United States.

Purpose of Geneva Trip

NOSENKO explained that it was his personal wish that _
had brought him to’Geneva, that he was allowed to travel as
"a treat" when it appeared to be the last occasion he might
have to travel to the West. [NOSEINKO said in 1962 that when
he became Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, as he
expected to become, he would travel to the West every two
or three years.] He had-discussed the possibility of the
trip in 1963 with then-Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV,
an@ secured his agreement. He also talked with officers
of the Soviet Delegations Department, but after it had been
decided that he should go, the Chief of that Department,
{N.T.] ZHARIKOV, suggested that it might be unnecessary for
a security officer to accompany this particular delegation.
[A.G.] KOVALENKO, the new Chief of the Seventh Department, —

- supported NOSENKO's assignment as a personal favor. ‘Although
at one time NOSENKO said that GRIBANOV approved the trip, he

“hag later asserted ‘that GRIBANOV.was. not involved and that

if GRIBANOV had learned of NOSENKO's plans, he would:not

have permitted NOSENKO to go.

- » NOSENKO's. only mission was to concern. himself with the
general security of the delegation, as he had done in 1962.
He had no specific tasks such as on his earlier assignment
(e.g., investigating SIAKIDV or supervising the BELITSKIY
operation). . a . .

. Comment: . NOSENKO has never, satisfactorily explained why
>...  a-Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department would ~

draw an unrelated assignment abroad which 7
would last many weeks if not months. In’
another context, NOSENKO had described a KGB
conference to take place about this time where
plans were to be drawn up for KGB operations
during the coming tourist season: he ‘acknow-
ledged that he was expected to attend, but
nevertheless went to Geneva. :

Visits to Legal Residency

As in 1962, NOSENKO said he visited the Legal Resi-~
dency daily. According to strict rules, he explained, an
officer in his status {temporary duty assignment which was
independent of Residency] should not do so, but his case’
was exceptional because he was a Deputy Chief of Department
and because of the relationship he established in 1962
through the intervention of M.S. TSYMBAL. Illegals Direct-
orate Chief TSYMBAL, NOSENKO related in 1964, was an old
friend; they had become acquainted in Moscow before meeting
again in Geneva in 1962, when they dined together frequently.
TSYMBAL's wife once had taught NOSENKO in school, and
TSYMBAL had once offered NOSENKO a job in the Illegals

' Directorate. NOSENKO asserted that TSYMBAL's introduction
of NOSENKO to Rezident GAVRICHEV in 1962 permitted NOSENKO
to frequent the Legal Residency in 1964.

Comment: In 1962 NOSENKO attributed his access to the
Residency to his "old friend Yuriy GUK", not
TSYMBAL. . He mentioned TSYMBAL's. presence in
Geneva but claimed no close acquaintance, -

« Availability for Meetings with CIA
In 1964 NOSENKO behaved as if he had no official

responsibilities or any demands on his time, and he was
willing to spend all of his ‘time in meetings with CIA. . He.
‘said that his absence from the Disarmament Delegation could
be explained as "security duties" since everyone on the
Delegation knew or suspected that he was a KGB officer.
From the first meeting on 24 January until 4 February, ©
NSOENKO met CIA officers thirteen times for meetings usually
lasting for five or six hours. By mutual agreement, most
of the meetings started in the afternoon. On two occasions
NOSENKO arrived as early as 0930 hours and several meetings
continued until past midnight.

NOSENKO's Defection

On arrival for his first meeting with CIA during the
second Geneva. phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that
after long and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting
series, he had decided to defect. He explained that he had
recently been promoted to the position of First Deputy Chief
of the Seventh Department, and that because of the stature
and responsibilities of his new job, there would be few if
any opportunities for him to visit the West in the future.
Therefore, he had decided to seize the opportunity at hand
and to flee to the United States at once, leaving his family
behind. He foresaw no possibility of his wife and children
being permitted to leave the USSR for the "next twenty
years". NOSENKO told CIA that. "the hardest thing is. to part

with my family". He had, however, carefully considered: their -

‘fate as the close relatives of a defector, and he felt that,
because of his mother's position in Soviet society, no harm
would come to them.

NOSENKO was told that CIA accepted in principle his
decision to defect. NOSENKO felt that it would be best for
him to disappear from Geneva without a trace, leaving all
his personal possessions behind; he assumed that CIA would
exfiltrate him from Switzerland to the United States. He |
~ wanted to carry out this plat as soon as possible, but the
| CIA officers encouragéd“him--and NOSENKO agreed--to remain”
in place for at least three weeks more. The reasons given
NOSENKO for this request were:

-The desire to obtain further information on the

local KGB Legal Residency and the Soviet delegation to
the Disarmament Conference while he still had access;

Monday. This date was tentatively scheduled, ard NOSFimKo
again repeated his desire simply to “disappear without a
trace". He also asked about exfiltration plans. :

On 31 January NOSENKO reported the results of his
reconnaissance of the KG2 Legal Residency in connection with
the proposed audio operation, which would involve: microphone
transmitters operating on a carrier current. He told CIA he
had accidentally overheard in the Residency that the building
used its own batteries and generator, and therefore the :
scheme would not work. He repeated his willingness to remain
in place until the arrival of the CHERFPANOV Papers, (see
p-309) which he was told were en route from Washington. - He
explained that he nad been alarmed at the previous meeting
because the delegation was supposed to move from its hotel
to a Soviet villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappea-
rance would be noticed more quickly. This move, as he had
now learned has been postponed pending the arrival of a
housekeeping officer -from Moscow. ‘

At NOSENKO's request on 1 February, it was firmly
agreed that the defection would take place on the morning of

. 8 February. NOSENKO assumed that exfiltration would Le by

automobile to Nest Germany and thence by plane to the United
States, and his case officers confirmed his assumption.

On 3 February NOSENKO reviewed the CHERFPANOV materials.
The defection was still scheduled for Saturday, 8 February.

NOSENKO* telephoned the Geneva safehouse from his hotel
room in the early afternoon of 4 February and said: “I want
to come now and not go back." After arriving at the CIA
safehouse he explained that when he dropped. by the KGB Legal

Residency following the morning session of the Disarmament

~. Conference, he read a-cable ordering him to return to Moscow’

immediately to prepare for a KGB conference on foreian tourism
in the Soviet Union. The residency was arranging for a

ticket for NOSENKO ‘to fly. to Moscow via Paris the following
day and a replacement was being readied to assume NOSENKO's

‘duties as security officer for the Soviet delegation in

Geneva. Before he had left for Geneva.in January, NOSENKO
then related, the Soviet Government had Leen deliberating
the question of expanding foreign tourism in the USSR and had

tourist operations, and, specifically, awareness of all
significant KGB operations against American tourists.

Information Furnished the KGB by George .BLAKE

The KGB agent’ in MI-6, George BLAKE, in 1959 furnished
the KGB with a documentary account of the joint CIA-MI-6
meeting in June of that year, (see p.148) and he was to
furnish other information by which the KGB could keep’
current on such hostile operations. Another. CIA-MI-6 meeting
was held in Washington in April 1960, of which a twenty-one
page summary was made. BLAKE also passed this document as
soon as it came-into his possession to the KGB.

KGB Study of American Intelligence Tourist Operations

The lengthy 1961 KGB Top Secret study referred to earlier
(see p.149) reflects the detailed and accurate information
in possession of the KGB during the period of NOSENKO's ©
alleged service in the Seventh Department in 1962-1963.

.Pertinent portions are quoted--as follows:

"It has been established that the Intelligence
organs of the. USA are displaying special activity
in the utilization of legal channels, specifically,
‘in tourism, for the purpose of conducting subversive
work against the USSR. Numerous facts indicate that
American tourists and members of various US delega-
tions, in the USSR strive to visit areas and instal-
lations to which employees of the Embassy and mili-
tary attaches have no access, establish contact with
Soviet citizens, and collect intelligence informa-~
tion. In this regard, the channels of tourism to
the USSR are used to dispatch experienced intelligence
‘agents to develop individual Soviet citizens with  ~
the objective of their eventual recruitment. In
line with the preparation and dispatch of such ;
agents, among the tourists the Americans also make

KGB Counterintelli ence Operations
Among American Tourists: Summary

BLAKE *
KGB documents establish the KGB concern for the threat of
American tourist agent operations and the scope of KGB
actions to thwart that threat. The effect of NOSENKO's
statements is that the KGB did not know of the American
tourist agent program. He averred that the Operations he
described accurately depicted the nature of KGB counter-
intelligence operations during the period. ,

| SEVENTH DEPARTMENT ~ 1962-1964: Summary and Conclusion

According to NOSENKO,. in January 1962, at the direction of
: General GRIBANOV, he was appointed Chief of the Seventh De-
partment American-British Commonwealth Section in the expec-~
- ..tancy that he soon would be named a Deputy Chief of the Seventh
‘Department. As a Section Chief, he personally handled agents.
{ - pna supervised all Second Chief Directorate Operations against
$ American and British Commonwealth tourists, of which he de-
. Scribes four. In this‘ périod NOSENKO also was assigned the
y} °.. Unrelated duty. of serving as a security escort officer with a_
Soviet delegation travelling to Geneva in which capacity he /in-
vestigated a delegate of suspected loyalty, SHAKHOV. While in

On that visit to Geneva NOSENKO first contacted CIA. _ In July
1962, NOSENKO claims that as GRIBANOV promised, he became one ~

as well as his accidental discovery of the identity of an.
American GRU agent, and the investigation and search for a

aspects of his statements, including those relating to his
Supervisory duties and to the nature of Second Chief Direc-

NOSENKO has retracted his assertion that he was a liéuten-
ant colonel, a rank appropriate for a Second Chief Directorate
Deputy Chief of Department, and asserts that he was never
promoted beyond the rank of Captain.

Most damaging to NOSENKO's claims that he was a supervisor
in the Seventh Department is his assertion that he accurately
describes KGB counterintelligence Operations against foreign,
particularly American, tourists. a senior Seventh Department

officer would be aware of the Second Chief Directorate's pre-

occupation with American tourists: I£ NOSENKO is unaware of

CHAPTER IX

Most of NOSENKO's assertions can be examined in a chrono-
logical fashion, as has been done in the proceding sections.
Some can most easily be examined separately, since they
relate not to any particular period of his KGB service nor
to any specific position he claimed he occupied, but to his
entire KGB career. The principal aspects in this category:
of claims are those he made about his relationship with .
Second Chief Directorate General GRIBANOV, his Party status,
his knowledge of certain KGB forms and procedures, his
sourcing of KGB operations, awards he earned for KGB service,
and his KGB rank,

Relationship with General GRIBANOV

From his first meeting with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO main-
tained that he had a close personal and professional rela-
tionship with Major General GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second
Chief Directorate. NOSENKO described recruitment approaches
in which hé and GRIBANOV took part together, conversations
they had on operational matters, the role which GRIBANOV
played in his promotions, awards and assignments, and their
after hours carrousing. According to NOSENKO, GRIRAMOV was
wholly responsible, against NOSDNKO's wishes, for his. .
appointment to the position of Deputy Chief of the American
Department Embassy Section in 1960, and when NOSENKO later
rejected GRIBANOV's offer to make him Chief of the entire
American Department, it was GRIBANOV who arranged his return
to the Seventh Department as Chief of the American-British
Commonwealth Section and who shortly thereafter appointed
him.a Deputy Chief and thereafter First Deputy Chief of the
Seventh Department. :

The plan was written by another KGB Officer.); GRIBANOV
ordered NOSENKO to prepare study on foreign intelligence
services use of tourism (Contradicted. NOSENKO could recall
no details of the study nor whether he ever discussed it
with GRIBANOV.); GRIBANOV promised to promote NOSENKO directly
to lieutenant colonel from the rank of Captain and (subse-
quently) personally congratulated him on his promotion to
lieutenant colonel (Retracted: NOSENKO never was promoted
past the rank of captain.); GRIBANOV was instrumental in
NOSENKO's receiving personal commendations from the KGB
Chairman, the Orders of the Red Banner,.the Red Star, and.
the Order of Lenin (Retracted. NOSENKO received no such
awards.); GRIBANOV ordered NOSENKO! to Geneva in 1962
(Retracted.  NOSENKO went at the request of the Soviet
Delegations Abroad Department.); GRIBANOV ordered NOSENKO
to assume charge of the BELITSKIY case (Contradicted.
NOSENKO did not supervise the BELITSKIY case.); GRIBANOV
allowed NOSENKO to go to Geneva in 1964, "as a personal
favor" (Retracted. GRIBANOV was not aware that NOSENKO
was to return to. Geneva a second time.): and finally,
GRIBANOV was NOSENKO's patron (Retracted. Their relation~
ship was no closer than their relative vank and position
indicated.)

Conclusion

NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to

. his claimed relationship with GRIBANOV discredit his single
. and most important unretracted claim, that NOSENKO, on
| GRIBANOV's appointment was Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Department.

Comment:. NOSENKO is the only Soviet official known to
CIA who claims to have occupied a position of
trust and who claims he was not a Party member
at the time,

*

In the period following, "to show his eagerness" and’ "to
improve himself", NOSENKO asked for Party assignments. For
more than a year he ran errands and collected newspapers and
performed other such tasks. He stated that he applied for
Party membership in January 1956, was accepted as a candidate
member. in 1956, and that he was accepted as a full Party
member in 1957.

Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims about his Party activity do not ‘sustain
his claims to KGB service, and they suffer from identical
discrepancies with respect to chronology, plausibility,
and contradiction by independent sources. It is concluded
that NOSENKO was never a Komsomol secretary and, if a member
at all, was no longer a member after reaching his twenty-
sixth birthday in October 1953. The period in which he haa

ho Party status was twenty-eight months, not the fifteen he

claimed, and it covers the period of his first tour in the
Embassy Section as well as a portion of his initial Seventh
Department assignment. An officer unqualified for Party _
membership is ineligible: for :KGB service. Consequently, the
evidence provided by éxamination of NOSENKO's Party status.
indicates that he was not serving in the KGB through at
least a portion of the 1953-1956 period.

Awards and Decorations

Since 1964 NOSENKO has claimed to have received various
awards, commendations, and decorations for his KGB service.
His assertions are material to any judgment of his general
credibility and, as well of the validity of his claims to
having occupied various KGB positions.

In January 1964 NOSENKO mentioned that in 1962, shortly
after meeting with CIA in Geneva, he received the Order of
Lenin for ideas which he developed to "enlarge the experience
and improve the quality" of Second Chief Directorate per-
sonnel in Moscow.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO was asked about
his awards, and he first said he received the Order of the
Red Banner,.then corrected himself to say he received first
the Order of the Red Star. He confirmed that he received
the Order of Lenin, in 1963. {Earlier he had said 1962,
"just following visiting Geneva".] He ctaimed he received
the Order of Lenin for his performance in his Seventh
Department assignment, but when he was asked what recruit-
ments justified his receipt of the award, he said the main
task of the Seventh Department was not to make recruitments,
but to counter the hostile intelligence service operations.

. [For his. contradictory statements regarding the Seventh

Department's mission, see pages 103 and 326 +] The Order

of Lenin was the highest decoration for which a KGB officer
_ is eligible, NOSENKO said, and besides himself, the Chief

and former Chief of the Seventh Department received it.
NOSENKO said he received in 1962 the Order of the Red Star,
he "thought" for his service in the Embassy Section in 1960-
1961, not for Seventh Department service; no explanation
accompanied that decoration. ; :

received a commendation from GRIBANOV in 1960, he said, "for

Red Star, he statec, with a group of Second Chief Directorate
case officers "for general good work"; IVASHUTIN made’ the
presentation, which included a medal and a certificate which
the officer may retain.

Comment: A week later, NOSENKO said that he received this
award in December 1962. He said he recalled
that the presentation was planned for the KGB
Anniversary on 20 December, but the presentation
was delayed and not made until the end of the
month.

In 1962, NOSENZXO claimed, he received another :commendation
from GRIBANOV for "general good work", and he also received
the Unblemished Service Award for ten years' service.

Comment: At this juncture his interrogators reminded
NOSENKO that his most recently claimed date
of entry to the KGB was March 1953, and that
in 1962 he would only have had nine years'
service. NOSENKO said that he could not under-
stand why, but he was certain he recéived the
service award after his return from Geneva in
1962.. (The date is consistent with NOSENKO's
earlier retracted claim that he entered the
KGB in 1952.) The following day NOSENKO
announced that he recalled why “he received the

(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER)

Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims to having been the recipient of various
awards for KGB service are inextricably linked with his
claimed operational successes, his rank, and GRIBANOV's
patronage, on atl of which topics he had made virtually
categoric retractions.

NOSENKO's Sourcing

NOSENKO cited four general sources for KGB operations he
has related, and in all four there have been inconsistencies,
contradictions, and retractions. Three of these categories,
each with an example typifying the difficulty of judging the
validity of his sourcing, are personal participation (W.E.
JOHNSON), p. 268) cases learned in the course of specific

p-24). The fourth category of sourcing relates to the

‘notes of KGB operations which he brought to CIA in Geneva
“in 1964. . :

Regarding the notes, NOSFNKO said he collected them at
various opportunities in order. to bring them to CIA. He
kept them in a wall safe in’ the: office which he occupied as
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department. [In this connection,
NOSENKO admitted that not all offices had such wall safes,
and not all offices of Deputy Chiefs of Departments, but
asserted that. his did.] Most of the notes are in NOSENKO's
handwriting. Those that are not include the only copy of a

typed top secret summary report from one:of the: Seventh
_ Department section chiefs, a similar handwritten report by

another Seventh Department officer, and a carbon co of a

KGB document which summarized the recruitment of an Austrian tl
businessman. NOSENKO said he. copied the date for the
remaining notes from such sources as- the-"Special File",

which was held ordinarily by the Seventh Department Chief.
According to NOSENKO, he obtained access to it for various

(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER)

In June 1962 NOSENKO volunteered that he was then a major,
but that he would soon be promoted to lieutenant colonel.

In 1964, in Frankfurt awaiting transportation to the
United States, NOSENKO reviewed and approved a biographic
statement which included the claim that he had been a senior
lieutenant in the American Embassy Section from 1952 (sic)
‘until 1955, that he was promoted to captain in 1956, to major
in 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO claimed that
at the end of 1953 or the beginning of 1954 [not in 1952].
he was promoted to the rank of senior lieutenant. When it
was pointed out to him that that was less than a year after
he. entered the KGB, he asserted that his Naval RU service -
was taken into consideration.

Asked in June 1964 to list his promotions, chronologically,
NOSENKO asserted that he became a senior lieutenant in 1953,
in 1956 a captain, in 1959 a major and, in October [in
Geneva, just afterwards, he said November] 1963, he. was
advised by Personnel that he had been promoted to lieutenant
colonel and afterwards was personally congratulated by
General GRIBANOV. NOSENKO did not recall the month of his
earlier promotions. : oO oo . oe

Comment: KGB defectors have commented that it would be
; ' unusual for a KGB officer not to recall his
date of rank, from which he computes. his
seniority and time in grade towards his next
promotion. 7

.. In January 1965,. while discussing his role as case officer
for Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN, NOSENKO volun-
“teered out of context that he had never been a major nor was
he promoted to captain in 1956, as he had claimed earlier.

He explained that he became eligible for captain in 1956,—
‘but his promotion was withheld as punishment because he had

(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER)

NOSENKO said in October 1966 interrogations that he had
lied when he. had claimed in 1964 to be a lieutenant colonel,
that actually he had been but a captain. Asked why he had
claimed in 1962 that he had been a major, NOSFNKO denied
that he had ever even mentioned his rank to CIA in 1962.

Conclusion

NOSENKO has stated that he became a senior lieutenant in
the KGB in 1952, April 1953, 1954, or, 1956. He was promoted
to the rank of captain in 1956 or September /October/December
1959; a major in December 1958 or 1959; and a lieutenant
colonel in October/November 1963. He brought to Geneva in

°1964 an official KGB document dated: November 1963 identifying ~

him as a KGB lieutenant colonel. In retracting his claim
that he was ever a major or lieutenant colonel, NOSENKO
asserts that nevertheless as a captain, he held the position

of First Deputy Chief of the Seventh: Department.

NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to

his KGB rank. parallel.and are apparently related to his

contradicted and retracted claims regarding Naval RU

Psychiatric Examination

’ Since April 1964 NOSENKO has been under the observation
of the CIA psychiatrist. Besides monitoring many of the
interrogation sessions, the psychiatrist has visited NOSENKO
weekly for the first year, monthly until 1967, and at some-
what less frequent intervals since.

Findings ©

NOSENKO is neither psychotic nor neurotic, Of above
average intelligence, he is shrewd, perceptive, and highly
adaptable. His memory is not defective. Besides suffering
.from ordinary lapses of memory, however, he sometimes
falsely claims lack of recall. NOSENKO's thought processes
are unimpaired; he.is rational and fully capable of distin-
guishing fact from fiction.

{SUMMARY OF CONCLUS TOTS) ,

This examination had led to the following findings,
arrived at independently: .
-NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the
capacities or at the places and times he claimed.
-NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the Manner or at
the time he claimed.

“NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section
throughout the 1953-1955 period as he claimed.

During the period 1955-1960, he was neither a senior
case officer in, nor Deputy Chief of, the Seventh Depart-
ment American-British Commonwealth Section.

-“NOSENKO was neither Deputy Chief of the American
Embassy Section nor a senior officer or supervisor in
the Section during the period 1961-1962.

"NOSENKO's claims, that. in 1962 he was Chief of the
American-British Commonwealth Section and was thereafter
a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible.

-NOSENKO has no. valid.claim to certainty that the KGB
. recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and
his defection in 1964, a ;

These findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of
probability or certifude, but they reflect the preponderance
_Of available evidence in each instance.

The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive
evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides.. The contradictions in
NOSENKO's accounts of his life and KGB service are so
extensive as to make his claims as a whole unacceptable.
While truth and fact in this case frequently cannot be

-established with certainty, it is evident that truth and
fact are not what NOSENKO relates. By almost any test,
virtually any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned by
fact or probability, or contradicted or retracted in his own
statements. NOSENKO is not what he claims to be, and thus
he is not a bona fide defector.

respect to his rank, GRIBANOV's patronage, the recall

invention, since these were the subject of comment by other

are left with the hypothesis that NOSENKO was dispatched by
the KGB. While this explanation does not reconcile ail the
anomalies, none of them renders it untenable,

In the Absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or
other persuasive evidetice to the contrary, CIA finds that
the evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was
dispatched by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires
that he be regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and
that his information should be assessed accordingly.

gated on the substance of a letter alleged to
have been written by Galya MORELLI, which his
