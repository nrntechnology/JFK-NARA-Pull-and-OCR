Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I,; 27 October 1966

1 INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201 system are: .

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that _
individual.

._b, The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form =>: =~

" 831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, ie, per- °~- oO

sonal history, current status, aud prospects. ooo

ew : The ‘Master 20r Record: a “machine ‘yebord Ginetaied by: the opening oF

a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 refererice for the Main Index and * °
stores the pertinent i information which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

d. Matin Index Master S01 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an .
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding di data items | or r lines will be moved up and the ref.
erence consolidated.. ~~

e. Ol Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 ‘per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OF
codes for use by components:

(1) general ol codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OI codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-
orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
‘when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 20] system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service. .

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers
exist.

3. OPENING A 20] DOSSIER
a. General

-The opening of a 201. dossier is the prerogative: of an operational ‘com-*

a. Purging a.

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier being forwarded to Central Files for retention should
be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following: .

‘ (1) Duplicate material, i.c., exact copy(s) of a document.

(2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for
the opening.

(3) All abstract slips,
(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information if
a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number
then must be transferred to the first page of the raw report.

(6) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch
cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments.

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information
contained in other documents in the file; authorization for destruction is
by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in-a 201 dossier
forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for retention |
in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized
officer in the originating office or the Records Officer having jurisdiction
over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret. classification '~
authority. If the document canriot be downgraded the file should be retained’
at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be removed,. retained a
in a desk TS file or forwarded to ‘the Top Secret Control Officer, and ‘a:

_ cross-reference sheet’ (Form sary placed in the’ "2a file le giving ‘the location

number, the attachment will be filed by the date of the basic document.

(2) Deferred documents will not be filed in a 201 dossier. If they are
to be retained in the dossier they should be sent to IP/RMS for classification ;
into that 201.

(3) Field index cards (hela by some- desks) and area desk cards may ~
be retained in the 201 as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards
should be mounted on a full-size sheet of paper for filing in the 201. .

(4) A 201 dossier previously opened on a person who becomes a staff

J employee and which contains Record Copy documents will be restricted to

: the ISG/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. The dossier should be
closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it.

7 (5) A 201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the true
name 201 if one exists or converted to the tue name. = =~

(8) Field and duplicate (shadow)*201 files no longer of active interest
should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material
has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified
to that 201 by the Analysis Section (IP/AN).

(7) Any document with a predecessor organization cover sheet or an :
OPC (Office of Policy Coordination) cover sheet from the Archives and
Disposition Section (IF/ARD) m must be returned to IP/ARD for processing
to the 201.
