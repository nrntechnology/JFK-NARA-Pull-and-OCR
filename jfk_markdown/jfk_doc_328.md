. 1. On the night of 8 March 1968, the case officer for
Manvel ARTINE. Buess met with bim and outlined the policy
decision reached by the 503 Committee on 4 March. ARTIME
was told the decisiuns was to terminate our. operational
relationship in as friendly and. cooperative manner 6s :
org soretee not later than 1 May 1965, The case officer

been empowered to convey. th!  Snformation and to con .
duct an exploratory ‘agiseussion of the. problems and possible
solutions connected with s phase-out program. - The two
main pointe the United. States Governnent was. concerned
vith were (a) fair but rensonable desobilisation: support

to the personnel of the autonomous group, and (b). AXTIME'sS
assistance is insuring. that the. balance ox: power in Central

. america was not upset. particularly by preventing the
ons of his group. from falling into the: hands of © : ¥
' political extremists oF free-booters. . co

ee a 8, ARTIME had. deen oD notice for several months that
_ ff) @ phase-ozt might be ordered: at. any time, and had an inkling

: % the decision bad been made because bis regular aonthly

- gubaidy had not been received on echedule. He had obviously
given the patter considerable: thought end made up his mind
as to his course of. action when he arrived at the aeeting.

. He began the digoussion by gcuamarising the things he might
Rave done had be peen so inclined. Asong the. possibilities
mentioned, he included: loading up his troops and weepoos
and taking over Haiti as 8 pase sgeinz* Capa, intervening

. Costa Rica to bring down the Libera: PLY adainistration

who can furnish about 1,000 nea to flesh out the unit.

Case officer acknowledgwi (aat ee recognized his potential

for heraful action, had considered it thoroughly, and Lo .
be would not do anything of the kind, ARTIME ssid : : oo

he had also considered all the possibilities and concluded . a -

there was so point io his being childish and trying. to wt .

“bate us about the ankles.” : a , . ;

3. ARTIME accepts. the decision and will cooperate
dm a phase-out program. He does not understand the
. . rationale, and, of course, does not agi. ¢@ with the
. Gecitsion, but be acknowledges our prerogative to make it.
If we really wieh still to be friends, he is willing,
Jost as he told Mr. FitzGerald originally, He asks only
‘that we help him make. it possibie io rewain friendly and
makes two requests from us: (a) help take care of his men.
ané their fanilies until they can rehabt:itate and . too
resettle themselves, and (b) do everything possible to - . -
get his parents out of Cuba. . : j

4. The major elesents to be considered in a phase-
| eet were discussed with the following results:

-~
.

~ a. Personnel, The first priority is support
payments to dependents which were due 1 March in...
‘the total amount of $100,00. This must be. cone
g@oonest if ARTINE is to maintain control of the |
- gatuation. The next. most immediate problem is. me
.. Pe-entry permission for fifteen of his men who have =
been stranded in Nicaragua trying to return to the
Waited States since. December. These mon were ex-
@iltrated "Diack" from the Unitzd States with our
agsistance and require special authority for.
: peeentry from Departaent of State and Department of. .
- Gustice, which we thought was arranged in early

. The demobilization plan proposed by. ARTINE
eesncd as realistic and effective as could be: hoped
for, Rc proposes to retura the bulk of his men,
approximately 200, to the United States during March
ans give then one month's pay on 1 April as a .mustering
out may:ent to aupport them and their tamilies while
they seek other employnent. The balance of his men,
leas than 100, will bs held in Cantral America for

-@uring April aad will be paid a custering out pay~

pest on 1 May. This will terminate the project.

‘She cover story which ARTIME intends to use
for desobilization is to informa his men that their

pothership is out of commission and.vill require about

eix weexs for repuirs. ‘This is true enough so that

4t will be believed. He will then grant leave to all
men vith dependents to get their personal affeire ia.

order before operations commence again. He will
publicize the fact that it is less expensive and

better for morale to send them on leave than to have

men sitting around the camps with no operations to
run. When all the first contingent are back hone,

indivi¢ual notice will be given each to start. looking

gor other work as operations have been postponed. .

_ Phey will be told that the salary payment of 1 April

will be the last one and should be considered as a
swustering out bonus. ARTIME. ‘eels this: method will

appears to be an excellent one. The mothership, MV .

put her in the yards at Galveston, Texas, some tine °
in Mareh or April, ARTINE can order his security detail | i
to store the arus aboard the ship for "secirii,” reasons :
before she loaves for the yard. They will simply re-
@ain on board when the ship. leaves and we can take ;

4, Maritins,
(1) MV SANTA MARIA, See above. The ship.

would be sailed from Monkey Point with a contract
erew supplied by Chester, Blackburn, & Roder, Inc.

Ribernic Corporation, a CIA proprietary company. .
Qne of ARTIME's senior officers would accompany .
. ' the ship as his representative, with orders to. —
_ turn over control of it and the arms upon its |
arrival at Galveston. CIA officers, possibly —
oa documented as Customs officials, would accept. =.
ut eustody and Office of Logistics could recover the
weapons and any other equipment which might be -
e@hipped by this method. The ship would then be

At could be sticky legally and might. antagonize

In the ond, he should be reasonable about disposi-
tioa of these craft if we snoot square sith hin

(GS) Support craft, Lows, Barges, otc. Dispo-

@ition arrangenents to be worked out together on

these craft.

e. Aircraft, ; .

(1) DC-S.  ARTIME is willing to release the
aircraft back to its “owners,” TASA, a CIA pro-
prietary coapany in Panama, Hovever, one conth's
charter payment of $1,250 was due 1 March, and
another will be due by the tine the aircraft can

_ be returned.  ARTIME was reluctant to kt the plane

go back without payment, but also reluctant to
e@queeze the $2,500 out of his budget. Case officer

. Woiced his opinion that the owner would probably

be glad to get the plane back and would not likely
think it worth going to court, However, in view

of the fact that it would be a "closed-circuit"
¢@ransaction and would actually cost the Government
aothing, it is recommended that a special suthoriza-
tion of $2,500 be channeled to ARTIWE for payrent
ia iy to aaintain ARTIME’s reputation for fiscal
probity. He will surely appreciate this geature.

(2) 1-20 Beaver and Cessna-180. These

aircraft technically belong to ARTINE's group and.
‘Becovery would be a sticky matter, legally.

ARTINE hopes to hold control of these. aircraft

_. &0r the time being, and it is recommended that
“We go along with hia, saving disposition arrange-

ments until later.
ARTIME again emphasized at. the Close of the meotirg

that he must have soonest the March payments for fasilies
as an sbeolute mininus, bofere he csuid face aie peopie and

maintain control of them in order to insure an orderly phase

Mr. J. De Stefano

Background Sxetch on Dr. Manuel
artine Buesa ; .

1, Manuel értime Buesa, a non-practicing medical
@octor, began his political activities in Cuba during ‘the
year 1939 whon he participated in the formation of a civic
action type program known. as the “Commandos Rurales." The
Comandos Rurales actively participated with the Castro —
vegies during its initial agrarian reform, but eventually...
Broke with it due to Castro's shift to Harxism-Leniniss. —
It wax at this point that Artime formed the Movimiento de
Becuperacion Revolucionaria (uaR, Sovenmsat for the Recovery
ef the Revolution), a political organization which he heads
wp to date. ‘The degree of Artine’s activities in the civic
action program was reflected by the Zact that Artizs, prior -
_ > te Bis break with Castro, had been appointed = depiity in
. the Instituto. Hacional de la Befcrsza dgrogaria. CUBA). for. .-
. Qriente Province. . 4:;tine’s first contact with the Agency
s> geek place just prior to his epen break with Castro and. ke.
| wae exfiltrated froa the island by the Ageacy. - Avtine
dedicated himself to the continued development of the MRR
watil called upon by the Agency to be the political repre-
gentative for the Cuban Brigade 2506 which landed at the
Bay c2 Pigs. Artine was. captured and centenced to be.
exscuted. This vas lator commited by Castro to lite:
. Q@mprigonsent. In 1663 Artine wes among those repatriated
fo this country under the prisoner exchange. : a

2. Im mid-1063 the Agency again asked Artine to ‘head.

“ exclusively by Cubans and funded by the agency.

wp a series of training camps in Central America. Using

' the political banner of che MRA Artine’s group. conducted
several paramilitary operations against the island of Cuba
with varying degrees of success. In early 1965 by order
of the 30S Comaittes it tas deciced to piase. out the Agency's
support to Artime since it was felt that perasilitary opera—
tions against Cuba were futile and ineffective. Although be
disagreed with this decision, Artine has been fully coopera-
tive in digbanding hia organization. The paramilitary wing

ef the MRE is now completely disbanded, and a few political
representatives romain in Central America aod Florida.

3. Subject ia currently attempting to re-enlist the

, ‘Agency's support in order to keep his political organization
intact... If approved by the 303 Committee, Artine’s NEB

will receive a smali subsidy. Artine also plans to establisa

endoavor Artine would be strictly on his own without any

Chief, WH and Manuel Artime, we are currently in the process -
of submitting a recommendation to the 303 Committee that we ~
maintain contact with Artime and render support to him on a

oo mitted to us, would enable him to keep the MRR alive as a
'.* pecognized exile political organization, and would allow hin,
personally, to maintain his status as an important exile , te

. _ SUBJECT: Contact of Manuel Artime with Professor, George ~ ae ;
oa ‘Lodge and with Col, Barrientos of Bolivia :

1, YY talked with Manuel Artiae by phone the night .
ef 4 June; He said he had received a call from Professor :
Lodge that afternoon but was not at home to talk with hia, : .
(This was obviously a follow-up from tl:e offer made to — - an
Artine by Chief, WH to put hia and Lodge. together on his
proposed civic action activities.) I told him there was
fo reason he should not return the call and arrange for a
-meeting with Lodge at their mutual convenience,

_ 2. Artime said that wes his firs: reaction, but
before he could make the call another message had come in
’ grow Col. Barrientos of Bolivia asking it he could visit
. the country for the benefit of his advice and counsel and
- effering to send a Bolivian Air Force plane to pick him up.
and bring him to La Paz. I asked if he were acquainted
with Barrientos or an expert on Bolivia and he said he ‘new
mo more about either of them than what he had read in tie
papers. He had no jdea of the reason for the invitation,
but wanted to check with us and find out if we had any
requirements for him in cage we wanted him to make the visit.
told him I would check with Chief, WH noxt morning and
eall him back. . ;

3. On the morning of 5 June I called Artime. He said
Professor Lodgy had called him at 0700 that morning and told |
him he was interested in getting together with him, Lodge. .
gaid ke would be in Panama on 14 June, and Artime said he lf
planned to be travelling iz that area at that time anc could ,
easily meet him there. Artime told Lodge he was willing to
make a trip to Boston to see him earlier and that after such
preliminary menting, the next meeting in Panama would probably
be more useful, Lodge seemed delighted and invited Artime

to lunch vith him on 9 June, I suggested to Artine that

he plan to meet Lodge on 9 June, stop in Sashington on the . 4
way home where I could meet with hin (and furnish him a . oe
briefing on Bolivia which he desperately requested). I ‘

suggested he send a message to Barrientos ‘gaying he could
be in Panama on 11 June and could see Barrientos as soon
thereafter as transportation could be arranged. (Artime has
&@ visit with President Robles of Panama scheduled about that
time and can work it in, together with the meeting with
‘Lodge on 14 June in Panama.) ; :

4. Artime said he had found out the background of the
invitation from Barrientos. One of Barrientos’ trusted
aides had been to Washington or New York and in passing ©
through Mitmi enroute home heard a MRR radio broadcast
about countering subversion, civic action, etc. that
attracted his attention. There was also a brief analysis
of the situation in Bolivia which appealed to him as the . :
best-balanced hehad heard. He. thereupon started asking - i
questions about the MRR and Artime and was referred’ to one =~ -
of Artime's people who turned over some copies of “Tridente”
(magazine of the MRR). The aide remarked that he was going
to report to Barrientos of his discovery of a Cuban exile
group that seemed knowledgeable of Castro and Communist
gubversion operations and had some useful ideas of how to. .......
counter them, Two days later Artime received the invitation
from Barrientos, . . ‘

3. %In AMOT Reporte EE~1438, “4 June 1964, AMOT-84 further
reported information he had received from Iden A, as follows:.

a; Iden B said that AMBIDDY-1 was only concerned
with maintaining the small ASWORLD camp in ‘Nicaragua, where
there were weapons, ammunition, and seven men, who were there
without the knowledge of the ODYOKERs. Iden B said. that
AMBIDDY-] was awaiting an opportune moment to arm as many
friends as possible and leave for PBRUMEN

. b. Iden C said that there really were arms and
ammunition cached in the camp in Nicaragua, but that the seven

wen there spent all their time looking for persons to buy
the arms and anmunition, *

, e. Iden C also said he believed that if AMBIDDY-1 was
: keeping up his radio transmisrions and. payments to some
, Journalists it was because they served as a cover for his
commercial operations and that all the propaganda would
disappear when AMBIDDY-1 had to use AMWORLD money to keep up:

Meetings with AWJAVA-4 in Washington, 27-28 June 1965
Subject: Proposed Agency Programs ; , ’

: 1. Following the demise of AMWORLD, AMJAVA-4 has become
t _ familiar with three other Agency prograas, or proposed prograas,
3 _ and he asked if he could have some clarification as to just
what we wanted from him and his people. I! explained that there were
three different functions which needed to be done and that the
Agency was trying to develop programs to meet each ueed. The . . *
three functions concerning Cuba are: : ’
(a) to maintain the MRR as a. respected resistance.
organization with a political posttre which is acceptable to most
Cubans and not inimical to U.S. interests, We are asking approval of
- @ minimum budget for subsidy of the MRR which will pay for its
published and radio publicity matter, subsistence to survivors of
MRR killed, disabled, or captured, and travel expenses for. AMBIDDY=]
as the leader of the iiovement outside Cuba, We are trying to ,
guide A-l into a program: of Community Development/Civic Action .
projects in Latin America as a means of projecting an image of the
MRR and of A-1 as constructive, forward-looking people instead of
Simply exile counterrevolutionaries. We would hope that such
activities would keep the movement together, give the members .
practical experience which would eventually be useful in Cuba, and
in the meantine, would render useful results in countering
Problems of insurgency in Latin America.

periods of tine. When not mobilized, the Agency would asayxy
them inmaintaining employment and supporting themselves. Drey
would also, of course, be available for emergency operatiovens} -

the program handled by Mr, Ton Clines of SOD, who was preaent and.
@iscussed it more in detail with A-4,)

2. A-4 understood that the programs outlined above wore :
only parts of an overall concept concering Cuba, that the first was
designed to meet long-term political considerations, the saeond
ad meet long-term strategic requirements, and.the third to weet
current operational needs. He understood and completely aireed
with each progrem, and agreed to cooperate in executing oan of
them, to the maximum of his ability. He will be happy to sot and
recruit for us in each pregram, and will try to influence. rywprppy-1
aiong the lines we want him to follow. A-4 appreciated ou, |

explanations and stated that he could be much more helpful to us

now that he understood what we were trying to accomplish,

| -'.. 2. On 15 July 1965, with Mr. Andy Croce of CA Sturt, .

i T met Mr, Lodge at the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel to discuss.

’ what he knew about the relations among AMBIDDY-1, Bishop |

i McGrath of Panama, and.a rural development program they are...

i all working on.in Panama. ir. Lodge described Bishop McGrath wah.
as a real ball of fire, about 39 or 40 years old, born of ue
U. S. parents in the Canal Zone but he has taken Panama’ -
citzenship, He graduated from Notre Dame University, did. © .
graduate work in Rome and has taught in several European: |: mo.

o.., ..#a@ Latin American universities, such as in Chile. He is 9 7-7:

: _.  @ne of the three top Catholic prelates in Latin America
“f° ..:° | and has extremely close. ties with the Vatican, 6.g., he is |

eon the Ecumenical Council and on the birth control group. He.

' has an official operating budget of $2,000 per year which he.
augments from every conceivable source, particularly from ‘the
German bishops. He is politically and operationally minded,

an American completely in his attitude and behavior, a — :
typical Irish politician, Mr.- Lodge submitted somewhat: °

. wryly. His parents are retired and live in Miamt where he -

; visite often. . He recently met AMBIDDY-1 there on two occasions,
On this sams visit he also. met the Papal Nuncio from Santo o
Domingo (he appears to receive most of the hot potato type .
assignments in his. part.of the world). . :

Y 2. Veraguas Province of Panama is a selected testing |
. ground for community development programs in rural areas.
' FS 2s the poorest and most hopeless province of Panama, a
. Small armed uprising took place there in 1958 and wae put
; dovn, The Communista have their beat organization in Panama
‘~%0 this province, The program there is bared on the. village.
of San Francisco, about 10: miles off the. highway, and te an :

‘Pinto who has been thereabout 10 years, He is a dynamic
young man who has. lead the villagers to rebuild their village

. and church to develop their land and organize a cooperative
can and small credit facilities. The village is only 1,200

people but they raised by themselves $1,000 to buy materials . . co

and then built a training center capable of housing, feeding >

- and training 60 men at a time in rural cooperatives and rural .
development, One of their ideas is to select bright looking
leaders. and potential leaders from. ‘Yrural areas, first’ in .
Panama and later, hopefully, from other nearby countries. .
for visits of a few days in which they hope to brain-wash —
them of Communist type propaganda they may have heard and ©
show them what can actually be done so they can take the
good word with them to their own communities. This is in
addition to the regular formal course. of 4 months for
selected young potential leaders from rural communities in
Panama and all over Latin America.

3. Another leading light in the program is Father
Steele who was thrown out of Dominica by Trujillo for
organizing cooperatives and is-a recognized authority on.
v6 the subject, Father Steele uses Veraguas as a home base :
but travels to Chile, Colombia and other countries conducting
short training courses on the ground, There are some. Dutch
‘priests on the staff whom Bishop McGrath personally recruited.
. Father Vasquez Pinto has sent about 10 to 15 local boys to
. the Antigonish School in Nova Scotia and they are. back for
duty. Wr. Lodge describes the group as a highly motivated
and enersetic group and Father Vasquez Pinto as a young and
effective Panamanian priest who is a good operator.. ir. Lodge
has two men from Harvard University there to study: ‘the .
and assist in any way: they can. The Peace: Corps has
- 84 people in the Central Provinces of Panama, about 30 of
. them in Veraguas Province. They cooperate with the center,
- 4n fact the two Harvard men are interviewing each. of the :
-’ Peace Corps volunteers about their work. Mr. Lodge said they
= ave coming up with some good informat‘on and ideas: which other-
wise would be lost as there is a good. deal of. experience
- among the Peace Corps kids but they don't know to recognize -

hope it will become a pilot program for Latin America and -

that they will be able to seed other similar programa from

this one. They hope to be able to spot and develop leaders
in remote arcas for future operations io those areas. :

Incidental to these major objectives, they are also nelping : :)
to develop the economy of Veraguas, to develop production, Lo.
transport to markets, credit facilities, and in general to i

help alleviate grievances which the Communists have exploited.
in the past. . re ,

$, Bishop McGrath hae arranged with AYRIDDY-1 for about

eantaneneeenenvinenrmne fF

pix of AMBIDDY-1'S people to attend the January 1966 training I toi
course, with 3 or 4 to remain on the staii. Hopefully, one : ' a
of them will develop into the executive director of the — i .

center. It was agreed that the first men will not be too - : .
closely associated in the public cye witu AMBIDBY-1 in order t sot
to try to forestall initial bad pubticity fren opposition ~ . fa j t-
elements... “AMBIDDY-1 and Bishop McGrath agreed, therefore, : :
that Nestor IZQUIERDO (who is well known as a long-time
adherent of AMBIDDY-1 from 1958-59 Comandos Rurales days _

in Oriente) would not be assigned to the Panama center at
this time. - AMBIDDY-1 told Bishop McGrath that he would try : .
to obtain sufficient gunds to support the men assigned to the 2 7
center, He has not yet brought up this matter with his case — ‘
officer, and as the amounts will be very small; he may” try to-
squeeze it out of his newly authorized budget. . However, he.

y ask the Agency for additional holp to sponsor these men
while they are working their way into the program. It is ;
dntended that- the. Cubans would continue cooperation in the ~ |:
program; eventually working them into the field wherever they.
are. needed and acceptable. ’

ve een eneee meen snres oe

Be Mr. Lodge. will meet Bishop McGrath next in Panama
on 29 or 30 July. As. a. coincidence AMBIDDY-1 will probably
- pe in or near P around the same time, as he left 14 July |
Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama for meetings with their

1. In late July 1965 members of the AMLILAC Group re- .
ported the following information as a result of their contacts
with various members of AMYUM located in the JHWAVE area...

A. AMBIDDY~1 has a warehouse in the WAVE area in
which he is storing equipment brought back from his Central
‘American base. The equipment includes UDT gear, boat motors,
rafts, uniforms, and bulldozers. There are no weapons. in the
building. : . . :

Hoe B. AMBIDDY-1 is planning to put the BABUN PC into
proper condition for use asa Mother Vessel, The vessel is
now in Tampa. . AMBIDDY-1 spent over: $10,000, on this ship

©, AMLILAC-8, a former AMLILAC who was fired a-

couple of years ago and who has been with: AMBIDDY-L's group

- @ince then, war; in the local area recently and. told AMLILAC-6 -
_ that A-8 was the caretaker at one of the Bases in Central .
America along with 9 other men. He stated that they had all
the weapons from the last effort and were preparing the camp «
for re-activation, . AMBIDDY-1 told A-8 that $500,000, was
available for the reactivation. ae

@. The penchant of PBRUMEN exiies for exaggeration,
eabellishmonts, and contortion of information (as can be
geen from paxva 1 B, and C) continues to plague the remnants
of AMWORLD and as a consequence gives rise to jealous fears
on tas part of the AHLIZAC Group particularly as to the real
state of ryi7el) ‘Such reports as those above and others when

collected by the AMLYLACs - tend to affect th: latters' morale
‘and confidence in KUBARK because the AMLILACSs believe that
anything AMBIDDY-1 does is done with KUBARK support and blessing.
As Headquarters is aware the great fear of the AMLILACS is that
AMBIDDY-1 will get all the action and all the glory. Rowever,
in view of the current KUBARK/AMBIDL;-1 relationship the
AMLILACs have little to fear and a renewed morale crisis is not
expected to arise. On the other hand, if AMBIDDr-1 were to
re-activate part of his action force and conduct a raid utilizing
non-KUBARK support, that would be another matter. It would then
be very difficult to convince the AHLILACs that KUBARK was not
'» .davolved and their morale and confidence would be badly shaken.
This situation is brought to your attention simply to show what
“st effect such AMBIDDY-1 activities would have on this Station's
: painstaking efforts to retain a superior and *xperienced commando
capability under already difficult psychological conditions, .

REF: UPGA 22667, 10 August 1965

1, Am you know, the HQS ANWORLD case officer recestly visited
the WAVE area and went to the warehouse’ with AMJAVA-4 and his wife,

_ described as a possible purchaser of some of the equipment, The _
warehouse is full of moldy and rusting camp and support: equipac.:t, -
most of it of.no use in mounting. raiding operations. There. are.
outboard motors, small. generators, engine spare parts, air drop .

_ equipment, bedding, etc, ia addition to a large nen of baby chicks
purchased by AMBIDDY-1 in bis latest venture of training for rural
civic development programs in Central Anerica. . There was ope -
custodian working around. the warehouse and taking care of the .

’ ghickens, AMBIDDY-) has. also purchased an off-set printing preas,
for $10,000 according to his, which is set up a few blocks avay.

He plans to use it to print the AMYUM magazine, plus hopefully
making some profit for ANYUM from it on commercial printing Jobs.

2. AMJAVA-4 and AMBIDOY-1 both ‘laughed heartily at. the idea
that the PC of BABUN could be converted to a-motherrhip,. This :
was considered and rejected several months ago when AMWORLD was
still authorized to operate. They turned down the. offer of the
hip aa a git thon on greneds that it would be uneconomical even
if given to them free of charge... : . ;

3, AMBIDDY-1 said he did have a total of ten men in. Nicaragua;, |
five at Monkey Point guarding a cache. of. email arms and teaching the
local Isdians to read, write. and grow rice; three men at. Bluefields

a cache of small arms and working to develop a eaall boat
yard for repair and maintenance. of shrimp. boats: from. which. AMBIDDY~1
hopes to. build a fishing cooperative; and two men at: Managua. with.

a smaller cache of suall arma, one of whom is the AHYUM: delegate
to the Nicaraguan Government. . AMBIDDY-1' kept about 150!small arms, [
with the knowledge and consent: of EQS, in return for his: giving back:

made to seize them, AMEIDLY-} said nenad neither plang sor go
ta reactivate any bases, except as they aight be used for local
eivic action type prograns, .

. 4. AMBIDDT-1 was advised by his case officer in strongest
{ _ terms to sell or throw avay ver, thing from the Central American

. canps, to concentrate on trying to project a new inage of hinself
as a constructive and progressive leader Lovolved in community
developacat and civic action type programs in Latio Awrica by
invitation of the local governments, and te stop talking or acting
a8 @ paramilitary operator, He was advined in eveo stronger terns
to got out of the SAVE area-as soon as possible to remove hinsetf
as a target of constant personal attacks against which he could .
not defend hinself. He agreed in principle, subject to waiting: .
three sonths for his wife to deliver their. first child. . oO

-

5S, WAVE may assure the AHLILAC leader that, to the best
knowledge of 2 the AMWORLD program is dead, that. AMBIDDY-1—
has no real intention aad only limited capability of mounting. ,
raids, and that anything he. might do aiong the lines of paramilitary
action would certainly be without ODYOKE support or blessing given
. the present political climate in BQ8 area.

6. FYI, HQ8 continues to try to influence AMBIDDY-1 to stay
cut of paramilitary matters entirely, To this end, we shall try’
to keep his top operational personnel otherwise occupied in KUBARK
or other employszent, to keep him as fully and usefully occupied as

- pomsible away from the WAVZ and PBRUMEN area, and to convince him
' to #011 or lease his two Switt toats to ‘commercial enterprises
oF to ancther KUBARK program outside the WAVE area. .=s«.: .

fe, BS will welcome continued reporting on AMBIDDY-1's a,

activities from. WAVE. sources, which serves a useful purpose as.

@ check and monitor. for. the case officer to compare and contrast
_. With AMBIDDY-1's reports to him, In addition, we are recruiting

he. ne told A/l that he intended to run and fully expected to win the
. election, but would not need to buy any votes. He asked A/1 to

Please tell "Washington" that State is very clumsy and if they
really want to know anything they should call on the Agency, or

the FBI, either of which is much more effective. SOMOZA said

everybody in Managua knows about State's efforts to block his.

“eandidacy and are laughing at them.

; ®. SOMOZA suid he was meeting Daniel ODUBER of
Costa Rica at the border shortly, and they would make a "non-
aggression pact" agreeing that neither will make trouble. for.
the other's canpaign for election to Presidency. ODUBER had
asked for the interview. SOMOZA told A/l that he thought
GDUBEZ had made a "live and let live" agreement with the Com-
munists, and that at their meeting, he would demand from ODUBER
@ public denunciation of the Communists to be followed by
efizctive control measures.against them. .

. d. General SOMOZA, at A/l‘'s strong recommendation, . ao

" agreed to start pushing Civic Action programs through the National : +.
Guard in an effort to enhance his Personal image preparatory to .

the next Presidential campaign. SOMOZA asked A/1 to assist and
advise in this effort. 2

. 2. The next meeting with General SOMOZA by A/1 was , Jif
on 4 August, with following points: : : . . -

, a. SOMOZA said that the latest program of Fidel ‘ t
CASTRO is targetted against Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. . ood
Pers of the plan includes assassination of the Presidents of — Df
the three countries as part of a terror campaign to soften .
them up. He said that in Panama, particularly, President
Marcos ROBLES is a prime target but the Communists are exploiting .. -
& recent turn against him by the. National Guard because he has
cut down on their costs, pensions, and other privileges. If
ROBLES is eliminated from power, the Communists feel the chief . at
of tha National Guard will take over and they thinkémm they. .
can handle him more easily than they can ROBLES. . . .

bh. Source for above, according to SOMOZA, was a
Close associate of Marcial AGUILUZ, whom he described as the top :
Communist in Costa Rica and one who had recruited (fnu), FONSECA, | ~
a Nicaraguan now living. in Mexico. FONSECA is a bastard son of
‘one of SOMOZA's foremen, a Communist, ard an agent working.
' @irectly under order of Fidel CASTRO. -

: @. A/1 and SOMOZA talked again about a Civic.
Action program in Nicaragua and SOMOZA said again that he would
support it. He will assign Father LUGO, a Cuban priest who ©
served with the Bay of Pigs forces, to a position similar to a
Chaplain in the National Guard in order to assist in the progran.
SOMOZA will support MRR community development programs with
Whatever authorizations are required. and with whatever official
- OY personal preatige he may offer. :

3. A/l next returned to Managua on 17 August and met
‘with Major PEREZ of the Nicaraguan Customs Service » & personal. aide
to the General, PEREZ said SOMOZA was very angry (not at A/l or
AB gecale} and difficult to see. He said 3 Colonels were. under
avreat for 3 days each for disobeying orders. PEREZ was afraid
to-see SCMOZA for fear he might be arrested Also, However, A/1
O&ileaq SOMCZA by phone and was invited to visit him next day
at Tipitapa. A/1l met him the next day (18 Aug) and had lunch
-,with BOMOZA and (fnu) BENITEZ, a Puerto Rican, former politician
there who iv now in business but remaina in contact with and

and A/) went with SOMOZA in his car. While they were riding,
SOMOZA told A/l why he was 50 angry. . . a

da. A message had recently come to General——
SOMOZA from the Nicaraguan Ambassador in Panama saying that. he
had it from authoritative sources thal the BU. S. not only
would not support his candidacy for the Presidency, but would
strongiy oppose it. In addition, SOMOZA had word that Sydney
‘ROSS, Director of El Tiempo (Spanish language newspaper in
New York), after a recent interview with Asst. Secretary Jack
Vaughn of the State Department, had an off-the-record talk
with VAUGHN after the interview. VAUGHN had said that, so far
as he was concerned, SOMOZA was no different from the other
Latin American dictators such as TRUJILLO, PERON, DUVALIER,
STROESSNER, Col. LOPEZ, or Gen. CASTELL Branco, and that he
could certainly not support installing. another military dictator
in Nicaragua. The two reports were confirmatory in SOMOZA'sS

“mind and made him feel extremely bad as he said he has always

talked favorably about the U.S. and tried to cooperate with them
at every chance. : : : :

. e. SOMOZA checked with the U.S. ‘Ambassador: in
Wicaragua (whether in person or by sending Pres. SCHICK was
not made clear) about the matter, and. received a typical State

Department reply that the U.S. was neutral in Nicaraguan internal

affairs and would take no action about the elections. . The
Ambassador said he could not believe. VAUGHN could have made.
guch statements because of the U.S. position of neutrality in

Nicaraguan affeirs.

: £. SOMOZA also said he had sent a message to
Washington suggesting that if some of the other countries heard
about themselves being lumped with TRUJILLO, PERON, etc. they
might well call back their troops ‘from Santo Domingo and tell

: Washington to go to hell.

ae : g@. He said he was going abercd with his plans
regardless of what the U.S. does about it and reminded A/1 of
ir. J. C. KING's talk with him (somozA) at the airport in
Washington to let him know after the mistinon attack on the
BIERRA ARANZAZU that Washington would undersiand if SOMOZA.
‘decided to kick A/l and his camps out of Nicaragua. He used
this as an example of.an attempt from Washington to dictate

to bim which he had ignored, telling A/l that he was a friend,
_ would continue. to be, and would continue to make his own
decisions regardless of what Washington might want from hin.

“ A/L made another strong suggestion that SOHOZA take off his.
~ .. uniform and start making public. his civic action ideas. ia
mn addition, he again advised him to go perscually to Washington

the picture cleared up, A/1 Said, "Let's try to get along : '
with the Norteamericans, it's better to have then with us

talked about other things. (A/1 believes Luis could be i

1. Subject is a Spaniard who is believed to we
working now at the Ron Carta Vieja factory in Panam: City.
He previously lived in Managua and worked for Colonel
Miguel RUIZ Herrera (a Costa Rican sometimes employed by
General Anastasio SOMOZA) as a specialist in guerrilla
warfare.

. 2. About late May or early June, ESPINAL was
@rinking in a Managua bar and angaged one of A/l's dele-
gation in conversation, not knowing who he was. He claimed
to have been in Guatemala recently where he had worked with .
Some "goou people of the lower classes" in an attempt to
overthrow the Guatemalan government. He quoted at length,
and accurately, from Che GUEVARA and used examples, also
accurately, for some Fidel CASTRO operations on how to
overthrow a government. A/1's man played the part of a .
leftint sympathizer to elicit from subject. ‘Through the °
Nicarcguan security service, the MRR people found out

that Col. RUIZ H. claimed subject had come to him and:
Presented himself as a GW expert saying he was willing to —
work for him in an attempt to make a coup against the govern~
ment in Costa Rica. In early July, subject told Col. RUIZ H.

- that the Costa Rican operation was taking too long and nothing

much was going on, so he was going to Panama from where he
could be called back immediately when they were ready to go in
Costa Rica. Subject had also been overheard to say in Managua
that he had a special mission to assassinate a Central American
president.

, 3. <A/1 said the Nicaraguan service believes that
Angelini's Restaurant in Panama City is a source of fulse
paseports for Communists. A/1 looked at the place on his

President ORLICH, telling him the. MRR was out of business so far
. as operations directly against Cuba are concerned, and no longer ;

‘needs bases, money, or other support for such paramilitary . po
activities. A/l described the latest MRR program to. combat t foo
CAS':RO/Communist efforts in Latin America by engaging in . yo
community development and counter-insurgency activities. . He : .
asked only for help in projecting a progressive” and constructive : . ’
image and some basic prestige for the MRR and for himself. To °
that end, he reminded President ORLICH that. both of, them knew.
(full well that in the whiskey smuggling Scandals aud coup oe
attempts for whick A/l had taken the rap,. not only was he not
guilty, but had been, in fact, the first one to give the warning

in both cases. In return for those past favors, he now wants -

| Pres. ORLICH to put him together with Daniel ODUBER (the, PLN.
candidate for president who will almost certainly be elected)
_ din order to counteract the bad-mouth put on A/1 to ODUBER by-
Manolo RAY, Colonel FIGULS, and. Teodore, "Yo-yo" QUIROZ. _. Asi
proposed to meet ODUSER personally, and let him make up. his’, ”
own mind. Pres. ORLICH called ODUBER's office, but he was off
politicking on the coast. ORLICH then sent A/l with Colonel.
LIPPA (a good friend of A/1) to talk with ODUBER's secretary,
who also is a good friend of Col. LIPPA. The secretary (actually
‘a male assistant) said everybody talks about A/l but nobody really
knows him or very much about him. Some good liberal revolutiona-
ries say he is a good man, other say he is aS. 0. B. A/) :
replied that was the reason he had taken the trevble to come te
see ODUBER, that he would make his position. clear himself and oR,
woulg bo glad to confront any eccusers. if CuUBER so desired. Fi
The secretary said they were concerned about the sampaign - 2

A few days ago I was able to read a report on the activities __ .
in large scale of Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa, and the beginning of his : -
intimate relations with his present mistress. Bo

Of this report I can mention the most outstanding passages as
I had to memorize then, ; sons

“Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa takes his first steps in the public
life as Political Sargent of the ‘Partido del Pueblo Libre’ (Party
: Of the Pree People) whose leader at-that--time was- Dr. Carlos .

MARQUEZ Sterling. . . :

Later he directed his activities in the fight against General
BATISTA, going in the Sierra Maestra where he was apointed Lieu- i
tenant by Major Humberto SORI-MARIN, .

7 He was appointed Lieutenant because of his friendship with |
Major SORI-MARIN, because he was catholic, and because of the lack i
-of trained persons in the Sierra Macstra, . . It

"Ym answering, the CASTRO Regime accuses him of having stolen:
‘funds from the Cooperative of which he had charge. This waa
- @ertified by his friend Major Humberto SORI-MARIN,

: When he arrives in the USA, that is in Miami, Florida, he is
& guest of Mr, Ricardo LORIE and Mr. Michael YABOR. .

‘other Dr. Manuel ARTIKE Buesa and Mise Pepita Riera.

This argument. becomes stronger because of the appointment of

the MRR Delegate to the Democratic Revolutionary Front.

"pe: Manuel ARTIME Buesa aspires with all hie strength and
datrigues to this position. :

He seeks the help of Mr. “Macks” BAQUER, who is ‘said to

‘pelong to the CIA and who at the same time supports the FRD “(ORF).

He holds a meeting with Mr. SANJENIS in the Cafeteria Dough-
Wuts, at 8 and 33 Ave., sv. ; . :

Later, at a luncheon at the hone of Mr. SANJENIS, in Fort
Lauderdale, he obtains the support of Manuel VILLAFANA, Pepita
RIERA, SANJENIS, and Mr. PAULA, who agree to help him in his plang,

Nevertheless, he continues to look for support and tries with .

the BATISTA sector, maintaining reunions with MUJAL, Chile
and Engineer BADIA. -

The plana of the Council are being completed as far as the
eampe in Guatemala, etc., and in order to get the control on the

. eivil and military sections, due to his excessive ambitions, he

tries and obtains the support of the following persons: _ Col.
Dr. SARDINAS, Col. Orlando PIEDRA, Migue1 SUAREZ Fernandez,

., RASCO,
Caho HERMIDA, ‘Laureano BATISTA Falla.and Mr. Juaa MESA, who is

gaid to be a CIA representative. It is common understanding that

. this gentleman has helped him quite a bit.

"We aise receives the help of the Catholic Front through

Yather GONZAL¥? Posada and Father LLORENTE, who refused it ata

beginning.

“. Watn all this in his hands, he obtains the coatrol of the
military phase and appoints officers of his trust to the commanding
ts in Guatemala, such as the brothers San Roman, ‘SUEIRAS,

* EBneido OLIVA, Andrew Jr, Wanuel VILLATANA and Carol.

After the disaster of the Bay of Pigs and the return. to Miani,
he continues with his activities, taking active part in the Orange
Bowl act, where President John F. KENNEDY in presented with the
‘ “galse't banner of the Brigade 2506.

That banner was never, at any time, in front of the Bay of
Pigs, but came from Guatemala, brought by MORO-MOLINET and which
-bears his signature on one corner. ,

The Government of the USA was advised that they would sake
@ political play with this banner, so it is returned to Fort
Bernnet, and is later destroyed by true revolutionaries. ‘

" Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa has had contact with the BIRCH Society,

group of crazy Nazi who is an infiltree of the Communists.

friend of Dr. ARTIME and member of the Brigade 2500. (This young
man is the son of a Navy officer under BATISTA, who couaitted
suicide in La Cabana at the beginning of the Revolution.)

on SOPA Granda was in the company of his close friend Aida PEREZ
Pozo, who in turn was in the company of her "intimate" friends

ANWORID Meeting tn New York, 6 October 1964.
SUBJECT: AMVORID Contingency Plans :

1, AMJAVA-4 said that AMBIDDY-1 was very enthusiastic
about the AMEIJEIRAS operation and felt this was the real
key to success of our program to ovérthrow the Castro
Fegine. Ho is prepared to concentrate on this operation
coupletely fcr the imncdtate future.

#

2 I asked A-4 if they had done any planning on the
Basie that the AMEIJEIRAS operation might not pan out. -
Be asked me directly whether a decision had been made to. -
eeatinue or to cut off support to AMWORLD. I told him .
trast a decision had not been nado but that my Headquarters
was very interested in the outcome of the AMRIJEIRAS
operation on which he was working. He recognized the. :
Smportance of this operation and stated that he and A-ly
Bad conjectured that future support to AMWORLD might be
eentingent on success or failure of their handling of .
that case. I did not confirm or deny this point but told —
Bim that the organization would surely be happy if they:
wore able to handle it with success,

Secggptertee enema vets

3. A-4 then explained that he and A-1 had spent
eonsiderable time discussing the future of their progran
and their prospects vis 2 vis_ the Agency. He said.
that in their opinion one of two things would happen;
@ither the AVEIJEIRAS operation would pay off in which
ease they would be able to continue to operate with Agency

. Sapport but wita a diversion of major objectives or the
Operation would peter out, in which case they would have
te consider what to do without Agency support. He said
that A-1 was not only prepared to acoept a diversion of
primary objective but felt that present circumstances
Gictated the wisdom of such a move, However, both of
thea feel that their present paramilitary progran must
be sontinued, not because tt ia cructal to the outcome:

ef the Cuban situation, but because the strength which

Shey exhibit through these operations is the only attrac-

tion to AMWORLD that has caused the ANEIJEIRAS group to

. 4. ‘Ia case the AMEIJEIRAS operation fails to develop,
‘and the Agency should decide to cut off support to AMWORLD,
4-4 says they will contioue to try to operate as long as
they can. He said that instead of 200 people they night
be operating with 20, but they could do something. So lon:
as they have the hardware with which to operate they can

- “well” operations each time. For example, he said, they

would go to Cuban exiles, to Venezuela, to American.

businessmen, etc. and would tell them, "The October spvr- |
,

Will dedicate it to you and run it in your nam." He \

feela this would carry them for a few wonths provided they. :
can run 4 few successful operations, © .

’
wees aaa,

5S. A-4 said thet when the support ran out the

hardware was all gone, and there was nothing left with
which to operate, A-1 would take 12 or 15 of his hard
eore followers and go into the Escanbray in Las Villas
to make one last ditch effort. I asked him if A-1 felt
be would have any chance of a succeas and A-4 stated that
should such a state come to pass, A-1) would definitely
ge in with the expectation of being run down evertually
. @nd shot but that he would do this in order to go out in
. @ blaze of glory and to continue to: serve as a martyr.

_dm4 aaid there was absolutely no doubt in his mind that
- &1 vould follow this course, that he had a hero compulzion

and a martyr complex and was completely without fear of death.
é-4 again mentioned an idea held by A-1 that he will not live
: past 29 January 1965 (his birthday) because he is convinced
' that he is destined to reach the peak moment of his life .
@uring his 33rd year (as did Jesus Christ) and does not
expect to live beyond that time,

6. YF asked A-4 where he, »o:sonally, stood in suck &
fature undertaking. He said that he was no hera but he had
@edicated seven years of his life as a schoolboy and young
. Sea to Cuban independence, and hc could not stop now. He.

- would not go in deliberately to die as a martyr, but he would
cantinue with his work doing the best he could vith whatever
means he could come by, He stated, "A-1 is not such #8 luade?

- as Tony VYARONA who can separate hinself completely from ine
e@truggle and go out to sell used cars, A-1 cannot oxiet ic

@ Lage which. is routine and without personal power. He will. .
fe firot even in a suicidal mission.” A-4 stated that

14-0006]

he, hinself, was of a different sature but that i¢ would be
just as impossible for him to go to a routine type of work
and leave the work of liberation c/ his country.

7, 1 asked A-4 what AMVORLD would do if they vere —
able to commence operations agsin. He said they had two
targets on the north coast trait they would like to hit.
when they have another chance. Cae is Puerto Vita, the other
de Manati, They have target studica on Puerto Vita and have
just recruited a refugee from Manati who knows the area
thoroaghly and brought out a large number of photographs -
ef the target with him from Cuba. Unfortunately some of .
thes were confiscated by U. 8. Customs when he came through

Miani, but there were still enough remaining to plan an
- eperation. He asked if ve might be able to help recover the
eonfiscated photos, I told him that if approval to reconmence
eperations was givon, I was cure ve could do so. In the
aeantine, I was, of + Rot authorized <o discuss possible
gature operations but faterested in what ANWORLD was thinking
slong these lines. A~4 understood our position with the .
eurrent cuapension of operations.

1. At 1600 Lore, 21 November 1964, I complied with
AMBIDDY-1's request relayed through the Security Office
that he be called on FRanklin 3-1568 in. Miami.

— 2. AMBIDDY-1 described reports reaching him of
mysterious phone calls being received by various Cubans
in Miami, mostly MRR personnel or wives of MRR members.
- These calls started during ‘the morning of 21 November...
The caller was a North American who spoke Spanish and gave
his name as "Bill Jones." Tae caller sought in each case
to solicit derogatory information about AMBIDDY-1, with
: particular emphasis on A-l's alleged participation in oe
@muggling activities. The caller offered money (A-1 did.”
_not know how much) for derogatory information. :

AMYUM-19 and the wife of Manolin Hernandez. In addition ©
to smuggling, A-19 was also asked if the reason he. broke
_ with A-1 was because of the marriages of AMJAVA-4 or A-1l. -
A-19 denied these allegations tc the caller. . .

1 A-1 said that the story spreading through Miami —
as a result of these calls is that the U.S, Government --
and probably CIA specifically -- wae attempting to discredit
A-1 as a basis for denouncing him. A-1 was obviously ‘
distressed by these speculations, and. in reporting then

ho was in reality. asking th= question. -I gave him my.
unequivocal assurance that the U.S. Government was not.
responvibia for the calls.. .

. & I asked A-1 who he thought was responsible and ~
-he said "maybe tho Miami Herald." A-1. said that he had .

‘geen Al Burt earlier in the day (Saturday, 21 November)
and that Burt was angry because he felt that the. recent

AMWORLD's contraband activities, A-~1l felt that he

made an impression. Burt was particularly interested
in a denial of these charges which A-1 told Burt would.
be issued very soon by the President of Costa Rica (see
following paragraph). A-1 said he thought that he may.
have mollified Burt somewhat by having the meeting and |.
by promising him scoops in the future, but that Burt
still holds a grudge against hin.

. 6. AMBIDDY-1 said he waa expecting momentarily

a call from Manolin Hernandez in San Jose. Hopefully,
Hernandoz’ call would be to read a public letter from |
President Orlich officially denying the presence of _
AMWORLD training camps in Costa Rica and disavowing
charges that A-l or his people were involved in smuggling,
Orlich promised A-1 to issue such a letter. When he gots
