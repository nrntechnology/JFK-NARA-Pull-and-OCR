Venezuela

Sino-Soviet
dispute

a. Election campaigning ended
at midnight, but boosters for the
several candidates continued to mill
about streets of Caracas in defiance
of terrorist threats to shoot anyone
who ventured out for the next thre
days. :

b. The terrorists, it seems,
were all but drowned out by the car-
nival air,

c.. The FALN, meanwhile, is
trying to bargain off Colonel Chenault
for as high a price as it can, de-
manding variously release of all its
comrades, of all women detained by
the government, and of the six hi-
jackers who have been returned from
Trinidad to custody in Venezuela,

; ‘a, The Chinese Communists
will have nothing to do with the
idea of bilateral talks with the
Soviets under present circumstances,

b. Chinese party Secretary
General Teng Hsiao-ping, one of the
select few in Peiping's ruling cir- —
ele, recently told a group of visit-
ing Latin Americans that such a meet-—
ing could accomplish nothing.

(Cont 'd)

c. Teng put the issue of
another meeting of world Communist
parties even deeper into limbo by
saying that Peiping would be in favor
only when assured of the support of
a majority of the world parties,

d. Moscow, for its part, has
- apparently stopped thinking about
another gathering of world Communist
party representatives,

e. The feelers it put out
after the conclusion of the test-
ban treaty were received coldly by
some of the fraternal parties. They
felt such a meeting could only make
matters worse with the Chinese,

£. Indeed, Peiping saw this
to be Moscow's purpose, and when
the idea failed to take hold,the
Chinese took it to be a setback for
Khrushchev personally.

g. Their reaction to Khrush-
chev's subsequent call for a cessa~
tion of open argument was to press
_the offensive, and this they have
been doing in roundly abusive terms
since.

h. The forthcoming Afro-Asian
visits by Chou En-lai and Chen Yi
have awakened suspicions that the
Chinese are in hot pursuit of a
second Bandung-type conference=-~a
more rewarding enterprise from their
point of view.

a. Yesterday and on Thursday,
we detected what we believe to have
been operational training Launches
of standard 350 nautical mile sub-
marine-based ballistic missiles.

_ be. Two and possibly four mis-
siles were fired from submarines
based in the Petropavlovsk area to
the impact area at Klyuchi.

ce. Seven similar instances
have been detected previously this. oo
year, and there may have been others.
(INTERCEPTS) :

a. The Soviet Bloc will soon
gain an important propaganda outlet
in Nairobi, communications hub for
East Africa,

b. Plans are for a state-
controlled news agency to be set up
by the Kenyan government when it

achieves independence on 12 Decem-
ber. This will fall under the juris-
diction of communications minister
Oneko, who has well developed con-
tacts within the Soviet Bloc.

NS c. TASS has already agreed to
: equip the new agency, and Kenyan re-
quests for further financial and
techincal help are being discussed
in Prague and Moscow.

d. Kenyan journalists have
been training in Prague and, on re-
j turn, will find ready employment in
the new agency.

5. Czechoslovakia- a. Czech President Novotny
USSR returned from Moscow on Thursday
after signing a renewal (for another
20 years) of the treaty of friend-
ship and mutual assistance.

‘b. He apparently got little
else out of Khrushchev. The final
communique was conspicuously cool.

c. There were no Soviet con-
cessions, nor were there the usual
references to Czech "progress" or
to public support for Novotny's
leadership.

6,

South Vietnam

a. The first suicide by burn~
ing to occur under the new regime
was witnessed today by bystanders
at a crowded intersection in Saigon |
where a young girl went up in flames.

b. A note she left behind said
she was protesting the war of Viet-
namese against Vietnamese. At the
intersection are three villas which
house the ICC delegations.

c. There were no Buddhist
overtones,

d. Some think the Viet Cong

' encouraged her, but if they did,

they did not write her script. They
would have said it is the Americans
who are fighting the Vietnamese.

NOTES

South Vietnam Plans are now afoot to shuffle
South Vietnam's Corps commanders so that General .
Khanh, considered by General Harkins to be the best
of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV
Corps) area. General Dinh, the ambitious Minister —
of Security, is still resisting pressure to relin-
quish command of the III Corps area,.and is not in-
- volved in the current shuffle.

Cuba-USSR There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba,
3,000 oF these military, according to a bloc offi-
cial in close touch with Soviets in Havana. The
figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to
7,000. Some withdrawals continue.

Cambodia-Vietnam Sihanouk seems. to feel that cut-
' ting off his noSe to spite his face was not enough. .
Now he says he will formally recognize North Vietnam
if the US does not silence the Khmer Serei radio.
South Vietnam will cut Cambodia's primary access to
international markets via the Mekong river if he
does. (INTERCEPT)

Indonesia-Cambodia Sukarno apparently plans to go
ambodia on an official visit following his trip
to Manila, The Cambodian ambassador in Djakarta has
advised Phnom Penh that Sukarno plans to leave for
Manila on 6 December and directly from there for
Phnom Penh on the 10th. He will stay three days.

Coal and Steel Community Coal and Steel community
members at their next meeting on Monday will prob-
ably vote to raise community steel tariffs by an
average of nine percent, This would , bring the tar-
iffs of each member into line with Italy' s, the
highest in the community. Only the Dutch oppose the
idea.

British Guiana - Cuba GIMPEX, trading arm and
source of funds for Jagan's party, has worked out a
deal to supply the country's major electric utility

‘next year with fuel oil from Cuba. Texaco and Esso

have been the traditional suppliers.

Brazil-US . A press report from Rio cites "well in-
formed sources" to the @ffect that Goulart plans ;
soon to invite Mrs. Kennedy to visit Brazil so that
Brazil can pay -her the honors which it had planned
to render the late President.

Cuba-Morocco A three-man Cuban delegation is on
its way to Moroceo to try to patch up relations
broken by Morocco because of Cuba's assistance to
the Algerians..in their border war. (INTERCEPTS)
