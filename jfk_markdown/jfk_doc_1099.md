A Yes, and I really can't recall some of the other
people. We were -- we nad just moved the Station at that time,

in Paris, out of the Embassy into the old Rothschild Palace

and we felt that it was probably bugged, so all conversations

took place -- we walked around the garden and tyat type of

A Yes.

Q I see. |
Mr. Sanchez -- was he a member of the military?

Sanchez was.,in the Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

Cuban military+;type.
Q Was it your understanding that the Agency had received
instructions with respect to this activity from another
component of the Government?
A Well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether

they received instructions. [ have to assume, and I am pretty

positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.

And at this time vou have to remember that Bobby Kennedy was

overseeing this deal, >resumably for his brother, and he was 7

couple hundred staffers there, full-time employees of the
Agency, plus I don't ‘know how many contract employees,
independent contractors, probably another 200 minimum. It was
obviously the largest installation we. had. I think at its

height it had over 500 people in it.

Q Full-time Agency people?

Q Now, would Martinez have been one of those contract
people?

Q Even though he was located down in the Keys?
A oh, yes.
Q And what kind of facilities did the Station have in

Miami? Physical facilities.

A Well, they were located on the south campus of the
University of Florida, I mean, the University of Miami, at
the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained |
unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn
well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the
Dixie Highway inland. We had our own guard force.

Q official cover?

Q Non-official cover. What was the cover?
A It was a commercial cover. It was called -~ the first!

President and Vice President, normal corporate setup.

Q Engaging in any business?
A No.
Q Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community, |

how long could a non-official cover last?

A Well, obviously it didn't, but it was research

activities. Funded -- it:is a giant mechanism when you put

one of these things in for the funding and this type of thing,

Q Yes, I understand.
A So it was a research activity and’ the only people that
ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You
know, somebody would make an inquiry, you know, we can't accept
any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this
type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And,out of.
this one» thing, of course, then we were running these innumera-
ble-other™ covers with different activities. The guard
force, of course, were like -- well, they wore uniforms, Samitar
to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think |
that there was -- in the later days at that site I think the
Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other

Government. agencies, in other buildings, of course.

Q And this particular Station, then, was under the
supervision of the group we have been discussing?

A Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

Q When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume
responsibilities for the Miami Station?

A Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the
Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western
Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

Q Is there presently a Miami Station?

A Oh, yes.

Q And how large is it at the present time?

A Well, since we ~~ I think when we closed down the
Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present
time because we are in one of these periods. where: we -are
reassigning people, .5ut I think by the end of this fiscal year
therevare going to be between 11 and 14 people.

Q When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions
were being performed by the Miami Station?

A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I
think I have lined them out at:one time <=: collection of
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this
type of thing. Covert action.

Q This is the list of things you gave me earlier in

the deposition?

Q Which of these activities, if any ‘of them were
actually being conducted within the Cuban community in Miami?

A Well, the collection of foreign positive and probably
counterintelligance.

Q So the Agency was conducting counterintelligence
activities in the Miami area?

A Yes, sir.

Q Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-
intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting
in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?

A Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I
recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a castro agent that
came in by small boat and when she was -- she came in with a}
number of other people. When she hit the -~ they had a recep-
tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.

The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there. and

we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under Immigration

and\Naturalization Service cover. When the HEW people did the
preliminary interrogation of these people they had to. fill

out forms, where. were you born, this type of thing, bicegraphic+

type thing. These forms’ would be passed to our-peopte who would.
look at the forms and based on previous experience or what

they might have been doing, md they felt that perhaps they
might have some information of intelligence value, they would

reinterrogate them. |

It was in this manner that this gal came to our
knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined
that obviously she was receiving messages: and she was
sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillance
on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and
indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock
or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found
it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that
was cen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved
in. |

Q Were there many activities: of that type?

A Not really. You have got to remember that the
Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a large
squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some~
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from. --'
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

Q Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-
whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability
to properly staff the thing?

A ‘Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section '
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy
the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers
from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a
relationship there that had gone over a period of years
between the Agency and the Bureau.

MR.MANFREDI: We will reconvene at 1:00 o'clock.

O£ course, if these people went out and did something on
their own, they could do things we were not aware of, obviously.
You can't -- you know what they are doing during their eight or
ten hours that they are going to work evervday but once they
leave, we don't know what they are up to.

Q Did they have CIA credentials?

A No sir, because they were proprietary hires of this
commercial cover.

0. Did CIA levy anv intelligence requirements upon these
people other than in their duties -- in their debriefing
capacity, I should sav?

A No. When -- there were -- obviously there was a
standard debriefing form that covered questions of intelligence |
interest or a battle, you know, anvthing -- economic questions,
morale, and this type of thing, When these questions -- when.
these people were cebriefed and the. debriefer wrote up the
report, it would be sent from the AMOTS over.to the Station.
if the debriefing report contained something of positive
intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer -- well, not the
Case Officer but a staffer in the Station may or may not jot
down some additional requirements and.ask that that person be
recontacted and asked specific. questions.

0 Now, in addition to debriefing, what else did this
smaller broup of AMOTS do for the Agency in. the Miami area?

A This was their prime purpose.

A Oh, there were only about, I would say at the outside,|
I think there were about five debriefers with the support people!
which would he secretaries, translators, strictly administrative’
types. I don't think there were more than probably 12 or 15

BY MR. MANFREDT: Back on the record,

0. Before we move on to further discussion of the AMOTS

could. you briefly describe for.me what role the CIA plays in

resettling Cuban emigres?

A CIA doesn't resettle Cuban emigres.

0. What Agency is charged with that responsibility?
A Health, Education and Welfare.

0, Noes CIA play any role in that process?

A We mav assist if we are.asked but the idea of the whote

airlift was having relatives here. for somebody to claim you when
you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the

Government, and normally when these refugees came.in, they were

processed through the Center and then they had a place down on
Biscayne Boulevard they called.Freedom House and this was, of

course, all run by HEW, and they -- if need be and thev had to

care for them in Freedom Ilouse.

Then as soon as they could, of course, they-would move them
to the areas where they wanted to resettle them, where the
relatives were, this type of thing, and we had nothing to do

with that whatsoever.
0. Turning back to the AMOTS, and to the larger of the

two groups, what was the name of that group again?

A. SASER, Latin American Social and Economic Research.

0 We can call them LASER for short? |
|

A Really, they are both «= the onlv reason we separated

the two groups was for security because we had one group housed j
over here and the smaller group was over here. Obviously we
couldn't bring these refugees into the larger establishment, SO |
that is why wetook the smaller establishment to preserve some |
cover,

Qa , Okay. What activities was the larger group engaged
in?

A WELL, the larger group was engaged in the collection
of intelligence. They compiled dossiers on the principals
inside Cuba. They carded -- they kept card files on every
refugee that came throuqh the reception center. They provided --
they did do economic and social reporting. They put out a
monthly newsletter based on the information they collected.

went down there several years ago just looking through the files
to see what kind of shape they were in and they had such great
information for intelligence value in there as a picture of a
gal who might be the daughter of a Cuban refugee who just won
a swimming meet. It got rather ridiculous. So we purged those
files and took out that material, you know, which just didn't
have any pertinancy at all.

whether thev are on an island or perhaps other places, their
names turn up on manifests and this type of thing. Well, these

are put into a machine system. What we did when these cards

were all transferred back here in Miami, we did go through them

at random and pick out cards and then try to match it up with
what the machine system had to see if there was updated informa~

A There are no domestic activities at all in the
Miami Station. All Cuban activities have been moved back
here to Headquarters. The ‘!iami Station now is completely

does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban

situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

a career agent who nas been with us for a good many years
in Miami and we do use him co contact relatives of Cubans
who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the U.S.
who nave relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is done zrincipally with the idea of a
recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths, this
type of thing. Ile does contact these people all over the
United States. If we come across an individual that. looks like
he might be recruitable, or zerhaps we could even double him,
we Will, after we make our creliminary assessment, and we
find out where relatives anc these types of people are, we
will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact
