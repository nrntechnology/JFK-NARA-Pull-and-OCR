SUBJECT 3 Radio Switch Equipment for Demolition
Firing Purposes

° 1, After our conversation on ‘his subject on 30 December,
the question was discussed with Mr. fay Alpern,) TSD/AOB, and
us (Lee Poole, )TSD/QRF, The following information i¢ forwarded
for your consideration as a result of our discussions,

°
sn Be Mr.(atpeen) Audio Operations Branchy-recommends two
companies.as sources of cquipmient of thie nature, These companies
have experience, under classified contracts with TSD, in producing
reliable equipment for special purposes of this sort. They also,
of course turn out commercial equipment of good quality for normal
communications needs, These companies are:

29,0
a. (Motorola, Chicago, Illinois >
bi Kel, Cambridge, Maseachusetta ) 29,08

The TSD VHF radio switth edalpardnt for demolition needs was
developed for us by/Mctorola. 'Kell-Com! }ransistoriszed sets have
been produced to mest the special needs (rét for demolition purposes)

: of other SAS projects,

3. In the opinion of both persons conaulted, the expenses noted
in our first discussion should have produced a reasonable amount of
workable equipment if the source was both capable and reliable, s
JSD recommends the use of frequencies in the VHF /WHF spectrum for
equipment of this sort and crystal tuning control for reasons of reliabikty,

selectivity and rejection of spurious signals.

. 4. Inexpensive equipment of Japanese or American manufacture
in the citizen’ band frequency ranges for toys, radio contro! devices,

short range communications, etc., is available from many
manufacturers, Our Quick Reaction Facility can produce a

emall number of radio switches based on these deviczs witha
considerably lester degree of security from false signal triggering
with a lead time of 6 to 8 weeka, Simple mechanical protection
against accidental triggering can be gained by inclusion of counting
switches, for example, which require a preset number of firing
impulses intentionally transmitted to produce the final closure of

a relay and firing of a charge.

5. Reliability of operation in terms of response toa
transmitted signal of a given power is quite difficult to predict when
conditions of antenna length, orientation and exposure cannot be
foreseen, Location of the receiver.in a target building will also have
a strong bearing on 'range' from the transmitter, Building construction,
intervening obstacles and interference from other nearby radio fre~
quency sources will affect performance of the set.

6 you wish to discuss the pro*'ems in greater depth,

we recommend a conference with audio ‘echniciane or engineernr,

It may serve to clarify the appropriate haracteristice which special or m
modified commercial equipment shoule possess to megt the needs of your
operation. Prtblems of camouflaging the explosive or incendiary materul
to serve operational requirements would be minor compared to the
necessary consideration of effects on the receiver switch concealed
within which could have important effects on performance. :
