MEMORANBOM FOR THE RECORD:
. : ; SUBJECT: Bebriefing ef Edward G. Tichbern(P)

1. Edward G.Tichborn(P) arrived in Washington from his. trip to Cubs: during
the night of 31 Jamary 1960/. "e was debrhefed at the Rotel Statler from about
1000 to 1530 hours on 1 February. Those present atthe debriefing were Messrs.

03 (Phil Toowe) and Charles Penney frem W® Division, Me ‘Alexander Hunter) PP/EAD, and
ie Undersigned, This debriefing was very interesting and resulted ink a good
deal of pertinent information. The three and a half reels of tape derived free
therefrom are now being transcribed by this effice. Some of the more salient

points are noted below,
x

2. Some of the operational information and suggestions offered by Tichborn
are the following:

a. There appears to be little chance of a coalition ef the opposition
groups at this time or in the near future since they are not well organized
and each group xank would want to be the leader of such an effort. Also,
according to the muabers of the orposition to whom Tichborn talked, it is
the general consensus cf opinion that Fidel Castro is in no danger of loosing
his grip or the devotion of his followérsx for some time to come.

b. Fidel Castro seems to becone most xt upset and almost paniced ty . t
defections. Possessing a "Messiah-type complex" he cannot bear the thought
of someone leaving the fold. Rather than to let such defections pass on
unnoticed, he feels compélled to give rsasons and rake excuses. This then
‘blows hhe matter up perhaps out of proportion and quickly becomes a matter
of public knowledge. Tichborn feels that the inducement of defecticns could
perhaps have more effect on Castro than any other single, rational action ve
might undertake. .

¢, There appears to be a relatively long-standing schism between the
brothers Fidel and Raoul Castro. Raoul is the mone cold individual. As an
example, Fidel once ordered some '400 prisoners to be returned safely to their
hopes, but Racul had a number of.,them killed. The general feeling in Cuba is
ghet Fidel is not a Commmist, but that Raoul is undoubtedly at least a
fellow-traveller. Developing or exploiting this schism could therefore, be
operationally advantageous. (The fact that they are brothers would probably
have little effect on Fidel who Ras already reduced Ktxxurmt the land holdings
of his mother and another brother in conformity with the agrarian refor2
program and who jailed his sister, and fired a Minister, over 2 shake-dowm
on an insurance deal.) oo .
3. Of special operatioral interest were severs) individuals Tichborn .
mentioned who might have some influence on Fidel Castro and hence might be of

operational interest. They are:

- a. Pather (Padre) Alberto de Castro: he is a Jesuit priest presently
located in Caracas, Venezuela, who had been a teacher of Fidel Castro during
his youth. Castro was in Venezuela and saw Father de Castro there during
: ‘ which time the latter criticized Fidel for some of his actions. In spite of
“ _the fat that this remonstration occured in front of some of Fidel's men,
: _ and they leterthe latter treated “him with great respect. It was felt by Tichbern's source’
. Chatted.alone of this information, and by Tishborn, that Father de Castro undoubted
for an hour. has some-influence over Castro. Tichborn suggested that it would be of value to
determine whether or not Fidel has cny regular contact with Father de Castro
and.if so,what oferational potential he might have.

b.. Merb Mathews: he is a journalist with the R.Y.Times and was the only
American newspaperman covering the Castro story prior to his final success.
While Tichborn was in Vuba, a front page article ge appeared in Revolucion
(the regime's press-spokesman) on Mathews. It was a sort of editorial and
praised Mathews as a "real man" and one who understocd the revolution and
its aims, Tichborn feels that it might be to our advantage to get into
contact with Mathews since he appears to have the confidence of the

administration.

c. Professomiosco! Subject is on the faculty of the Universidad de
Villanueva and is a contemporary of Fidel Castro. They were claesmates and
both were debators although according to Rosco, Castro did not make the
: Debating. Society ‘of which he(Rosco) was the presidentCnce after the

revolution, Rosco attended a_sppech Castro made and after the oration, the

. TS latter asked Rosco wht he thought cf it. Upon hearing some criticism, he wanted
to kmow how it could: have been improved. Since Castro was leaving for .

itt « Venezuela ‘and the United States he asked Rosco to accompany him in order that
they could discuss the matter further. Tichborn feels that Rosco (a member of
"4 ~ the opposition) Sx probably has more influence on Castro than Rosco realizes

yf “and that this possibility would be worth looking into.

aA AY d. Edward R.Murrow: he produced a-TV program on Castro and Tichbora feels
ot that he might have established a rapport with Castro during this period. .

4. One of the contacts Tichborn made in Cube (the Director of Tourism) asked
him if he knew of anyone who would be interested in coming to Cuba on an all-dxpenses-
paid visit in order to write articles (or other similar propaganda) on present day
Cuba. Tichborn mentioned Clete Roberts, a popular radio and TV commentator in ios
Angeles as a possible candidate. (Tichborn also discussed this matter with Horace
W. Davis.) Tichborn will mention this possibility to Roberts upon hia return to
Californic. :

5. While in Cuba, Tichborn accidently met a young lady who later revealed to
him that she war "an agent for the ZState Dapartrent". He felt that this was a
security gatter and that it should ba brought to our attenticn for that purpose.
WB ote aid not recognize the name; it 13 being further checked cut with WH
Division, The incident and the details will be rade the subject of a separate
memorandum for CI Staff.

6. On the adntnistrative side, 4 Tichherr will forward by raf) his
\ "financial accounting, one copy to the cover company and the other to Henry
_W. Darkin(P). The cover letter which was provided him thy the event that
he cane to the attention of the Cyban authcrities was returned to us and is
now in his fila. (There was no necessity for its use.) Tichborn inquired as to
the possibility of receiving reimbursement for medical exponses which will _
undoubtedly be incurred upon his return to California due to a possible hernia
which developed in New York on hfs.return trip en route to Washington. This is ~
“being checked out by this office. Tichborn departed fgr, Los Angeles (having -been
‘ taken to Freindship International Airport by “enryil—Serkin) at about 1800 .
hours on 1 February 1960.
