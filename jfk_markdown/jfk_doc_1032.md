Eischhower authorized the CIA to
form a guerrilla urmy of Cuban

refugees and invade Cuba, Shortly
thereafter, the CIA dispatched
agent. Frank Sturgis to Guatemala
to confer with President Miguel
Ydlgoras ahout setting up training
bases in that country.

This “secret” mission was quickly

discovered ani reported by the Guale-
malan news media,
“I had planned to break info the
Cuben Enibassy while | was in
Guatemala City," Sturgis told this re-
porter recent "but the president sug-
Rerled I leave the country because of
all tha publicity, The newspapers and
TV reported 1 was a CIA ayent and
was trying to obtain bases for the
Cuban invasion.”

Over the next year, the CT.
Cuban recruits in’ Guatemnla,
Tuerto Rico and the United States,
Sturgis, a marine combat veteran of
World War Il, trained about G0 Cubans

VENEZUBLA

Out from Miami spreads a wave of vio-
lence. Terrorists’ aim is to topple Castro, free
Cuba. Nearly all Cuban refugees share this
dream. But the acts of a few zealots create
trouble for fellow exiles and for the U.S.

Reported from
MIAMI and WASHINGTON

Terrorism by radical Cuban refugees has become a thorny
problem in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and, in the
view of some authorities, a potential threat to the lives of
American leaders.

The terrorists’ goal is to wrest control of Cuba away from
its Communist dictator, Fidel Castro.

fn pursuit of that goal, they have blazed a trail of violence
from Miami across the Caribbean Sea, not only to Cuba-but
also to Mexico, Barbados, Jamaica and Panama—even UCLOSS
the South Atlantic to Argentina.

They have engaged in a series of bombings in the U.S. and
abroad. They have carried out military-style attacks on
Communist ships. They are strongly suspected of sever:
killings. .

A federal grand jury in Miami is investigating their activi-
ties and their leaders.

_ Now, as a new Administration prepares to take over in
Washington, it is feared that the Cuban terrorists will step up

i their attacks in an effort to thwart any turn toward reconcili-

ation with Castro.

- Officials familiar with their operations warn that some of
the Cuban ‘extremists will stop at nothing, not even at
assussinating members of the Carter Administration.

“The Cubin terrorists are the most highly trained assassins

_ insthe world today,” says one U.S. official.

Many of the terrorists were trained by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency in the days when this country was trying to
overthrow Castro, or kill him.

The Setiate Internal Security Subcommittee recently held
hearings on the Cuban-terrorist threat. It heard this testimo-
ny from Lt. Thomas Lyons, head of a special antiterrorist
squad of the Dade County public-safety: departinent in

Miami, where Cuban refugees
are concentrated:

“The overwhelming major-
ity of the Cubans in Miami are
strongly anti-Castro. That's
why they came to Miami in
the first place. ‘They are also
law-abiding citizens who, with
minor exceptions, manifest
their opposition to Castro in
logal ways.

“However, there are a small
number of individuals whose
hatred of Cuban Prinie Minis-
ter Fidel Castro and Commu-
nism has led them to engage
in extralegal actions and: to
violate the laws of the country
which gave them sanctuary.
These individuals use Dade
County as a base for international terrorism |. against
governments allied with Cuba, Cuban shipping, Commu.
nists, purported Commumists and individuals who tuke a
stand against their terrorist-type attacks. ...

“Some Cuban groups purporting to be involved in terrar-
isttype attacks against the Cuban Government are no more
or no less than outright criminals, feeding upon the Cuban
population and diverting the collected funding lor thei? own

Castro leader, is accused in

purposes.” wee

Other investigators charge that the terrorists, to finance

their crusade, have dealt in cocaine and prostitution and: ins =

extortion from wealthy fellow refugees.

The number of hard-core’ terrorists is- smalk officially
estimated at fewer than 300. But their reach is wide. In this
year alone they have either bragged about or been accused
of such aets as:

_ EXILES vs, \S8eG

CASTRO—
A Relentless
Pursuit

On Jan. 1, 1959, Fidel Castro took power and
the first wave of refugees fled Cuba. A small
number of the 600,000 exiles who Settled in the
U.S. have become extremists.

Highlights of events in those 18 years, some
involving law-abiding exiles, others involving the
extremists——

* 9964: A 1,300-man Cuban Brigade, armed and

. trained by the U.S. in Florida, Guatemala and Nica-
ragua, landed at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south
shore. The invasion was a failure.

1962: Survivors of the Bay of Pigs were released
by Castro after payment of a 53-million-dollar ran-
som in drugs, food, medical equipment and other
supplies from “private contributions.” President
John F. Kennedy, in Miami, pledged to the Cuban
exiles that the Brigade flag would one day fly over a
liberated Cuba.

U.S. launched its secret “Operation Mongoose”—_

a plan. to use Cuban exiles in paramilitary war
against Castro while U.S. maintained an economic

blockade to shake the island's economy. The attacks

generally failed. :
1964: Cuban extremists in New York City fired a
- Mortar shell at United Nations as Cuba's Ché Gue-
vara addressed the General Assembly.

1967: Cuban exile specialists and U.S.-trained
Bolivian troops trapped and killed Guevara and
some of his Communist guerrillas in Bolivia.

1968-72: Cuban-exile extremists bombed ships
of nations considered to be friendly to Castro, ter-
rorized other exiles to keep them in line.

1972: Cuban exiles trained by Central Intelli-
gence Agency took part in Watergate break-in, later
testified that they thought it would help their anti-
Castro campaign. .

1973: U.S. and Cuba signed agreement aimed at

‘controlling hijacking of aircraft and piracy of ships
‘at sea,
1974-76: Cuban extremists exploded more than
100 bombs in Miami area in two-year period, hitting
. offices of the FBI,-a State attorney and the Miami
police department,
“. Exile terrorists attacked airline offices and éonsul-
ates of goVernments that have diplomatic relations
with Castro. Bombings took place ‘in Jamaica, Mexi-
co, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Panama, other countries.-

Who are these terrorists? What motivates them? How do
they operate? And why are U.S. officials so concerned about
what they may do in the future? :

To answer such questions, Orr Kelly and Carl J. Migdail of

the US. News & World Report staff dug deeply into the
records, interviewed Cuban refugees who share the hopes
though not the methods of the terrorists, and talked to law:
enforcement officials who are trying to stem the violence.

BREEDING GROUND FOR TERRORISM

After Fidel Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and it became
apparent that he intended to establish a Communist state,
800,000 Cubans “voted with their feet” and fled their
homeland. Some 600,000 of them settled in the United
States. They and their children now total 750,000. Most of
them live in the Miami area,

The majority of these immigrants are law abiding. But
Miami’s “Little Havana” provides a culture in which the
virus of violence can grow, :

“In Miami,” explains one refugee leader, “the Cubans
keep their national identity, their heritage, traditions,
hatreds—and their hopes of going back to their homeland.
And they know they can’t go back until Castro is gone. So

\they dream of toppling Castro. What is clearly unrealistic in

other places in the United States seems very possible in the
atmosphere in Miami.”

In the early 1960s, the overthrow of Castro seemed to the
Cubans in exile to be not only possible but almost inevitabte,
It was US. policy to drive him from power. There was an
attempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs ‘in 1961 with an
army of Cuban exiles recruited and trained in seeret by the
CIA. The invaders were not given the air cover necessary for
a successful attack, and the operation was a disaster. Only
180 of about 1,300 invaders escaped death or capture. The
Cubans felt betrayed.

Then came other American moves against Castro. There
Was a secret “Operation Mongoose,” which included efforts
to ussassinate the Cuban leader, The United States backed an
economic blockade of Cuba in an attempt lo prevent Castro
from obtaining sorely needed supplies and equipment from

abroad. Later, Cuban refugees were used to curry out seeret .

operations not only in the Caribbeati but also in other parts

‘of Latin America—and even in Africa.

To many Cuban refugees, attacking Castro and Commu-
nisin became a way of life.
Since then, however,. American policy has failed to match
in intensity the fierce anti-Castro passion of the more mili-
tant refugees. In recent years, prominent members of the
US. Senate have visited Cuba. In 1973, Cuba made aun

ugreement with the United States to curb the airplane ~

hijackers who had been using Cuba as asylum. There were
Moves on both sides toward normiulization of relations bé-
tween Cuba and the U.S.

As their hopes of American action against Castro ebbed,
some Cuban refugees turned to violence on their own, The

includes representatives from Dade County and Miami po-
lice, the U:S. Customs Service and the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Although the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force,
its agents work closely with it.

With co-operation from Cuban refugees who are sick of
the terrorist violence, law officers have arrested a number of
suspects. Police also have learned enough about other sus-
pects so that their freedom to engage in new acts of violence
can be limited even though there is not enough evidence to
prosecute them.

A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might
have some knowledge of terror operations.

Efforts of law-enforcement officials to deal with the terror-
ist groups face formidable handicaps, however. The terrorists
seem to know what police are doing. Lieutenant Lyons
relates that one suspect “identified one of my officers who
had never met him before, called him by name and told him
what section he worked in and what his duties were.”

Terrorists are protected by a web of old loyalties. Most of
them worked at one time or another for the U.S. Govern-
ment. Many have had several roles: members. of the U.S.
Army, CIA operatives and FBI informants. One refugee
leader suggests that law-enforcement officials have not found
the killers of Cubans “because they don't want to.”

A further complication is the heavy -infiltration of the
terrorist movement by members of Castro's intelligence
corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as
agents provocateurs, instigating terrorist acts designed to
discredit the refugees and influence American policy.

The Cuban Prime Minister has “surfaced” enough of such
agents to reveal their pattern of operation. Early this year,
for example, Manuel de Armas, a Cuban refugee who was
named in Senate committee testimony as having been in-
volved in terrorist activities in Miami, showed up in Havana.
In an April 22 broadeast by Radio Havana, De Armas said
that he had supplied the explosives used in the killing of a
man named Rolando Masferrer and that a CIA agent had
provided him with the explosives.

In a speech on October 15, Castro boasted of a double
agent who Castro claimed had passed on coded instructions

TERRORISTS’ ARSENAL:
PLANES TO CANNONS

A further measure comes from this tally

: ‘m 20 handglis
~ .. @ Thousands of rounds of ammunition

from the CIA. Said Castro: “From the very moment when he
was recruited by the CIA and over-a period of 10 years, the
supposed agent has kept the Cuban Government fully in-
formed of all his contacts with [the CIA] and of the equip-
ment and instructions he has received.”

Castro blamed the CIA for the airliner bombing and other
acts of violence. “Who else but the CIA... can carry out
these acts?” Castro asked.

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S.
involvement in the airliner bombing. He said: “I can state
categorically that no official of the United States Covern-
ment, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in
contact with the American Government has had anything to
do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this
totally reprehensible.”

The CIA declines to discuss Cuban refugee terrorism.
Officials of other Government agencies say they seriously
doubt that the CIA, after all the criticism it has received for
some of ‘its earlier activities, is still involved in operations
against the Castro. regime. However, the agency is described
as providing very little help in combatting the terrorist
groups. “We have absolutely no contact with the CIA,” says
Lieutenant Lyons. “I’d like to, but they don’t talk to us.” One
reason for that attitude may be that laws bar the CIA from
domestic law-enforcement activities.

Other laws, or the lack of them, also complicate the fight
against the terrorists. U.S. agencies cannot become involved
in investigations of terrorism outside the United States unless
the crime involves violations of neutrality laws making it
illegal to conspire in this country to commit crimes abroad or
to export arms without a license.

Although shocked by the October 6 airliner bombing, U.S.

“officials reluctantly decided there was no authorization for

the FBI to enter that case.

With such handicaps as these, law-enforcement officials say
they can look forward to only limited success against the
terrorists. Any real solution to the problem musi come from
within the Cuban refugee community—and investigators
state that the co-operation they get there does not extend to
cases of violence committed outside the U.S.

WHAT HAVE TERRORISTS GAINED?

As officials size up the effects of the terrorist campaign:
The only tangible accomplishment has been to push Castro
into renouncing the antihijacking
treaty, thus discouraging efforts to-
ward a diplomatic reconciliation be-
tween the United States and Cuba.

Despite all the terrorist plots and
attacks, Castro remains firmly seat-
ed as head of a Communist regime
in Cuba. And it appears to the refu-

TO: RECORD. pe

FROM: HOWARD S. LIEBENGOOD :
SUBJECT: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT INFORMATION OF JANUARY 19, 1977

I called Larry Callahan at 2:00 p.m. to advise him that
the Commiteee desired to interview Mr. Gene A. Boren, of
the IRS, at the earliest available opportunity and requested
his advice and assistance to accomplish this. Callahan was
nervous about the Committee's eagerness to proceed in response ~
to the memorandum for fear that we would be interfering with
an on-going criminal investigation. He noted the FBI was looking
into this and he would have to check with the Bureau to .
ascertain the feasibility of proceeding unilaterally. I told
Callahan we did not want to interfere with a criminal investi-
gation and that I did not feel that our interview of the IRS
‘employee would fall into that category. Callahan referred to
a possible obstruction of justice on the part of that employee
in that the information had been withheld for approximately
five years. ) ;

At 2:30 p.m. I received a telephone call from Paul Daly
urging Committee restraint in unilaterally investigating
subject matter. Daly noted the Bureau had just received this

information and was intending to interview the IRS employee

HW 50955 DocId: 32423630 Page 25 —
and other individuals in question today or tomorrow. Daly
noted that he was disturbed that Callahan had brought’ the

memo to the Committee's attention so promptly, as the Bureau
had intended to brief the Committee at the conclusion of their
investigation. Daly seemed most concerned that the IRS delay
in bringing the matter to the’ Bureau's attention and assured
us that the Bureau was desirous of cooperating fully. He
noted the information had been furnished by Justice absent

a specific inquiry from the Committee and that we were being
unreasonable if we desired to pursue the matter further at

this time. I asked Daly what information was available at the
Bureau on Brading and Hunt. He said there was a large quantity
of information available on both and that he felt he could pull
that material which related. to the assassination quickly, but
would be reluctant to produce the information in its entirety.
I told him to ascertain this afternoon what information could
be produced immediately and he said that he would.

At 2:45 p.m. I talked again with Callahan who indicated
that Daly would be calling. Callahan said he thought the
Bureau was eager to redeem itself in this area and we should
give them that opportunity. I told Callahan that I was con-
cerned about the. rath lien of Lae a position which Callahan
thinks is ridiculous. Callahan, however, did state that this
information was not as old as it looks at the Bureau, to-wit:

While the Justice received the IRS memo on December 30, 1976,

HW 50955 DBocld:32423630 Page 26

considerable time went by before Attorney General, Levi could
address the issue of whether or not to entrust this matter to
the Bureau. Approximately one week ago, Justice went to Jim
Adams of the FBI with the request to look into the allegation
and was surprised to find that Adams was already apprised of
the situation and investigating, i.e., general indexes.
Apparently, Adams had been in receipt of similar information
-in recent days.

Yesterday, in response to the Attorney General's request
for information, Paul Daly hand carried to Callahan the Bureau's
response (which is dated January 14) and today Callahan hand
carried the package to us over Assistant Attorney. General
Uhlmann; s signature. Callahan advised that Daly was upset that
the Committee had been so promptly advised for fear that we
would interupt the Bureau's inquiry. Callahan apologized for
the lack of responsiveness on.the part of Justice and the Bureau”
but things are in disarray with Levi about to depart. I assured
‘Callahan we did not desire to interfere in the investigation
but desired to be promptly informed of any developments and
that we would stay in touch with Paul Daly in that regard .
Callahan promised to expedite any Committee requests as

' made.

Paul Daly called at 3:10 p.m. to advise that "the powers

the investigation. He specifically that the Director be given
an opportunity to talk with Inouye prior to any such action.

‘armly within the family.
though Kreiling’s role in

illingness between the two

Lamar Hunt observes
iat, since the bulk of H. L.

ling for Ray to be the per--
mn who looks after it.” La-
lar adds: “It does not mean

independent oil operator. Hunt Oil,

- which was my Dad’s company, will be

run basically by employees of the com-
pany. We all will continue to operate
out of the Hunt Oil office.”

‘Maxfield, who has been observing
the Hunts for nine years as Lamar’s
partner, believes that Hunt Oil and
Placid Oil will carry on the monolithic

“ base of the family fortune. “It’s like a

tree trunk, with each brother. having
his own branch,” he says. “Oil is not an
expression of the personality of the

summed upjmany of his findings, and which genérally outlines
what . Noyes believes was heavy Mafia involvement in the

and is largely based on substantiated information such as

police records provided by the FBI, the Los! ‘Angeles Police

mysterious man who was picked up by the police at the scene

shooting. THe man was apprehended by a Dallas/policeman who

Jim Draden'si True Identity Emerges

‘In early 1969, Peter Boyes, the investigative reporter
whose book covers much of the information regarding Jim
Braden, began ‘investigating the mysterious California
“oil man." 35

fi
Moyes originally received a tip about Braden from a
former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorney
Jim Garrison|'s investigation of the Kennedy assassination,
The FBI man ttold Noyes of Braden's presence at the scene of
the assassination at the time of the shooting.

Noyes soon found that Jim Braden was no longer at cither
of the addresses that he had given the Dallas police, and
had left no Forwarding addresses, .

Noves then had the California Department of Motor Vehicles
run a check on the license number that Braden had given to
the Dallas police at the Sheriff's office following the
assassination. Notor Vehicles told Noves that Braden'
license (H751755) had been renewed by Braden in San Diego
county in Movember of 1966. Braden has also listed new
business and home addresses, which interestingly were over
a hundred milles apart.

The Department of Motor Vehiclest records on Jim Braden
also showed that "Jim Braden" was not really his original
name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's
to Eugene lade Drading, which is Braden's true identity.
of
On Septenber 10, 1963, just ten weeks before the assassination
‘Bugene ilale Brading had notified the Department that he had
legally changed his nane to Jim Braden, and he requested a
new license junder that name. The license was granted,

Intrigued by the fact that Jim Braden was really a.false
_ identity assumed by Euqene Brading, investigator Noves
contacted the Intelligence Division of the California
Attorney Genoral's Office, and had a check run on the.
mysterious Brading. .

=

Toves was told that Eugene Hale Brading “is-a real bad guy.
He's got a Tong rap sheet and apparantly has Mafia connections,"

loyes shortly thereafter obtained a copy “of Bugene Brading's
(Jim Braden!’ 's) police records.

Paul Rothernel, a fermer FBI agent who was Dirgetor ‘of

has recalicd that he distinctly remembers Braden visiting

tne Hunt éffices, on November 21 in the company, of three

other men Rothermel has stated that the office log for
Uovenber 21| showed that Roger Bauman, (Bradina's old Mafia ‘
friend) and| Horqan Brown and Duane Nowlin “and friend"

hat Bradeniwas definitely the "friend." :

Also on Nevember 21, the day before the assas

Ruby was also: on his way to the H.L. ilunt offi
The Warren | ommission concluded that Jack Rub rove a woman
friend offfhiis to the Munt offices sometime that same after-
noon. Thell woman, who had declined work in Ruby's nightclub
as a stripy x, drove with Ruby to the Munt offiices, apparantly
in searchll of woloynent. This does coincide with Braden's
visit to jthe same offices on that same afternoon. :

Polis : : ie
‘The Narren Commission investigated several ether possible
links of Jack Ruby to the Hunts, including tha still
unexnlaing fact that Lamar Hunt's namie was found inside
one of Rubylis notebooks. But of these possible ‘links, the
Warren Commis ssion concluded only that evidenée. ‘did indicate

Thus a pobslible Ruby-Braden connection on the day before

LIEBENGOOD ‘ROUTH NOTES FROM U.S. V. VECIANA, ET. AL
DATE: December 1, 1976 :
Veciana was represented by Barry L. Garber, | 1040 City National
Bank Building, 25 West Flagler Street, Miami, Florida 33130
(305-377- ~4963)

‘Veciana became implicated as the result of ia drug bust
of one Augustine Barres, a/k/a/ Emidigio Augustine Barres Fangul
C"Gus Barres"). The bust resulted from an search warrant of
23 July 73 for Barres' attache case at the Taft Hotel in New
York. The police were acting on an informant tip to an under-
cover agent who arranged for a buy from Barres of seven kilograms
of Cocaine at the Taft. The police understood that Barres was to
be with a "female" courier. Barres advised DEA task force re-
presentative, Eugene W. Flynn, a detective sgt. with the NYPD,
that he purchased the seven kilos from Antonio Veciana in Miami
on July 21, 1973. i

Barres owns a home in Puerto Rico and trav els to New York

every two weeks on business.

eee |: Sa

A co-defendant of Veciana's in the case was Ariel Pomares
who is the President of Occidental Investment, a real estate
firm owned by Barres, located at 1186 J. T. Pinero Avenue,
Miami. Pomares is also involved with FRECA Imports in Puerto
Rico. This .is also a Barres enterprise.

: : Lj
The DEA Miami regional office cables that Veciana is the
subject of INS File No. Al2-490987 and that he claims to be a

public accountant. i

According to the Miami Herald of July 25, (1973, Barres was
Assistant Secretary of Communications under Castro and later the
general manager of the Havana Health Department! He fled Cuba
in 1961 for asylum in Puerto Rico. He became aliUnited States
citizen in 1970.

A cable from Ivan Wurms, the Chief Investigator of the DEA
Task Force to Durkin at DEA headquarters, Washington, states that
Veciana was arrested without incident on 7/24/73 and signed a
"consent to search" form. Miscellaneous papers | and numerous

FROM: Tom Moore : “if

DATE: Jan. 3, 1977

Telephoned Veciana to ask if he recalled any citenpts on

his life in late 1962 or 1963.. He answered that, there were

three attempts on his life, tut none in 1962 or 1963. The
first attempt, he said, occurred in a stadium in Puerto

‘Rico in 1967 when a bomb exploded approximately ab meters
\

away. Hé said he believed Puerto Rican communists were

responsible for this attempt. The second attempt occurred
|

-in Bolivia “in approximately 1970 when some men with weapons

appeared at a home where he was supposed to be. He said a

woman who owned the home called him to warn him.| | He said

he thought this attempt was related to a revolution which.

was taking place at that time. The third attempt}, he said,

occurred in Caracas, Venezuela in 1971. He added/ that he had

received information within the past three months| that Castro

wanted - to, kidnap him. |

The only relevant incident in late 1962 or 1963 was that
an Isobel Zarate began making inquiries about him) in Miami. He -
said many.. people in’ the Cuban community informed ithe FBI she

was a Castro spy and that she Subsequently escaped to Cuba via

carry- over from Church report
A. Relationship between agencies and Warren Commission

L. Warren Comm. staff has never been interviewed in
depth. Many have not been interviewed at all. The
Commission had. particular staff assigned to (a) Cuba
and (b) organized crime. They, especially, should be
fully debriefed about everything that happened in their
contacts with the agencies, their frustrations, unful-'
filled leads, inability to aet access, questionmarks,
and what they knew, heard, or suspected about contacts
at high- level bewween Commission members and top agency ©
officials. This would include leads to additional
documents, memoranda and people, and is especially
important in the time-frame just before the Commission
issued its report, i.e. as final drafts being written,
when staff learned for the first time about Castro's. -
threat. (Willens, staff director, said there were staff
pushing hard to re-open this subject, but pressure of
getting the report out prevailed.) :

2. Look for all other memoranda of contacts between
McCone and CIA re how to structure questions, etc.

3. We now know, that Ruby was contacted svereal times

by: FBI to inform on axganxzedxexxmexxnxBatkanxaxeax

k" criminal element” in Dallas area. All we've seen
is the cummary memo in which Wargen Commission was

so informed. Get each memorandum of contact between

Par agents and Ruby, i.e. underlying materials which
"support" the summary memo. :

B. The inter-agency committee which met to develop

continegncy plans in the wake of Castro's threat.

1. Numerous documents were sought from FBI, CIA,
‘Defense, State, etc., but never received by Church
Committee before our final report was issued. Must
follow-through, and then go deeper into it.

2. What else was known besides Castro's retaliation
threat? What facts went into the assessment that
Castro might retaliate against U.S. leaders in Latin
America, but not U.S. leaders in the U.S.? Precisely
what accounted: for the/# original inclusion of

Subject: Review of CIA documents presented the SCI by} Jack Anderson
a
- The documents recently received by this Committee, from Jack
Anderson, had previously been reviewed by the Church Committee staff,
The documents appear to be a few of those requested for FOIA review

by David Belin. ft is my understanding, after these documents were
declassified, David Belin furnished copies to both David Martin (AP)
and Jack Anderson.
The Church] Committee was permitted to review the ‘entire Oswald
201 file, the AMLASH file, Garrison files and selected| Office of
. Security files. The Committee primarily concerned itself with the
early period of the investigation (November 1963 - October 1964), as

it believed the information to be received from this time period

to be more relevant in evaluating the per formance of ‘the intelligence
agencies with respect to their investigation.

Dan Niescher, the Church Committee contact at the CIA, was the
individual responsible for the declassification of documents
relating to the | assassination of President Kennedy. During this
declassification process, Dan Niescher consulted the Committee staff
to make sure that we were aware of certain documents. In addition,
Mr. Kaleras had | given the staff unlimited access to all files we
believed necessary to conduct our investigation.

Yet, the possibility still remains that. the staff’ was not

_ Rosselli’s disappearance. a soure
| said. -

By RON LaBRECQUE
Harald Statt Writer .
Florida’s reputed organized
crime boss, Santos Trafficante of
Tampa and Miami, made a secret,

fore the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee to answer questions about
his role in a CIA assassination plot,
investigation’ sources have dis-
closed. . . .
Trafficante, 62, had not previ-
ously been questioned by the com-

- mittee or its staff in the two-year-

old investigation of CIA activities:
Of the three Mafia figures in-
volved in the early 1960s plot to
kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro,
only Trafficante is still alive. Both
Sam Giancana and John Rosselli

“were murdered within the last 16

months. ;
The murders are unsolved.

INVESTIGATORS ALSO said
that Trafficante had dinner with
Rosselli at The Landings, a Fort
Lauderdale restaurant, in mid-July,

- less than two weeks before Rossel-

li disappeared. Rossgelli’s body,
stuffed in-an oil drum, floated to
the surface of Dumfoundling Bay
the first week of August...
Trafficante reportediy has told
police that the July dinner with
Rosselli -~ as weil as several other
meetings previously at the Cordoba
Restaurant in Miami. fermerly
owned by the husband of Rosselli’s
niece, according to police — were

“friendly, social events with no

cante's associates at the time of,

Investigators said the gun was

but there are no records to indicate

ing to investigators and gunshop
owners. ©

Rosselli, whose most powerful
Mafia days were reportedly in the

1950s and early 1960s in Las Vegas .-

and Los Angeles, did appear before
the committee at least three “times
in the 12 months before his death.

In Washington, the committee
has kept a tight clamp on comment
about the investigation, and only
one member, Robert T. Stafford

(R., Vt.), acknowledged the Traffi-
cante session, saying “I was not
present when the witness you
speak of was in front of the com-
inittee.”

- Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii),
+the committee chairman who,
along with Sen. Howard Baker (R.,
-Tenn.} pressured for Justice De-
partment and FBI involvement in
the Rosselli murder case, said “I
have never met Mr. Trafficante.
That’s as far as ’ll go.”

. A PRIME interest of the commit-
tee has been possible links between.

the CTA Castro plotting and the ase
sassination of John F. Kennedy.
Revelations of the Senate commite
tee were a key factor in the cree
cation of the new House of Repre-
sentative investigation, which is
taking a new look at the JFE mitre
er. .

Trafficante reportedly has told
investigators that he first met Ros-
selli about 1956. It was in the early
1950s that Florida law- enforce-
ment officials estimated that a Boe
lita opertion run by Trafficante and
his brother netted $2 million amnu-

ly

Trafficante was a major game
bling figure in pre-Castro Havana,
where he ran a casino. In 1959, it
was estimated that $1 million or $2
million was bet nightly in all the
Mafia-run casinos in Havana. The
gambling stopped when Castro
took over in 1959.

Rosselli was. the first of the
three Mafia figures to be recruited
by the CIA in 1960 in its plot to as-
sassinate Castro. .

IN A CIA memo.quoted In avi fie

terim report of the committee @°

year ago, it was said that Traffie

cante’s role was to “serve aS a coue ~

rier to Cuba and make arranges
ments there.”

Rosselli told his CIA laison that
“Trafficante believed a certain
leading figure in the Cuban exile
movement might be able to accome
plish the assassination.” An interes
nal ‘CIA ‘investigation in 1967 “suge
gests that this Cuban may have
been receiving funds from Traffie
cante and other racketeers interest-
ed in securing ‘gambling, prostitn-
tion and dope monopolies’ in Cuba
after the overthrow of Castro.”

6 Attempts to Ki ll

By Juck Anderson

Locked in the darkest re-
cessea of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency is the story of
six assassiriation attempts
agalnst Cuba's Fidel Castro.

For 10 years, only a few key
people have known the terrl-
ble secret. They have sworn
never to talk, Yet we have
learned the detalls. from
sources whose credentials are
beyond question.

We spoke to John McCone,
who headed the CIA at the
time of the assassination at-
tempts. He acknowledged the
idea had becn discussed inside
the CIA .but insisted it had
been “rejected immedi-
ately.” He vigorously denied

-Ithat the CIA had ever particl-
pated in any plot on Castro's
Iife, Asked whether the at-

“ltempts could. have been made
with his knowledge, he re-
plied: “It could not have hap-

pened.”
We have complete confi-
‘idence, however, in our

sources.

: The plot to knock off Castro

arrival was expected to touch
off a general uprising, which
the Communist militia woul
have had more trouble: ‘putting
down without’ the charismatic
Castro to lead them. ; :

‘After the first attempt
falled, five more assassination
teams were sent to Cuba! The
last team reportedly made St

distance of Castro before they
were apprehended. This hap-

To set up the Castro assassi-

agen i shadowy contacts,
who had handled other under-
cover assignments for the CIA
out of his Washington public
relations office. He later
moved to Las Vegas to head
up billionaire Howard Hughes’
Nevada operations.

Maheu recrulted John Ro-
selli, a ruggedly handsome
gambler with contacts fn both
the American and Cuban un-
derworlds, to arrange the as-
sassination. The dapper, hawk-
faced Roselli, formerly mar-
ried to movie actress June
Lang, was a power in the
movie industry until his con-
vielion with racketeer Willle
Bioff in a million-dollar Holly-
wood labor shakedown. The
CIA assigned two of its most
trusted operatives, William
Harvey and James (Big Jim)
O'Connell, to the hush-hush
murder mission. Using phony
names, they accompanied Ro-
selli on trips to Miami to line
up the assassination teams.

Minnium is not pleased by such vio-
lent antics,

“we don’t: appreciate people com-
mitting murder and dumping a body
in our {county, regardless of who the
people are, but especially if it's organ-
ized crime,” Minnium says.

His \department handled 168 homt-.

cides: last year and boasted an 85 per
cent | ‘clearance record.” As of July,
1976, the Percentage was even higher,
standing at about 92 per cent.

If ‘Charles Zatrepalek' and Julio

Ojeda |have anything to Say about it, -

Roselli's killing is not going to dimin.’
ish: those percentages. Both men are
years -old homicide detectives who

vow with a schoolboy’s sincerity tha:
they won 't rest until Roselli’s murder
is solved. In the last four weeks, with
the help of Washington agencies, Za.

. trepalek and Ojeda have reconstructed

Roselli’s life in hopes of understanding
his death, For the third time in eight
years “of marriage, Zatrepalek worked
out of town on his wedding anniversa-
ry; because of the “awesomeness” of
this case, Ojeda spent his Labor Day
holidaylat work.

“Maybe 10 years from now,” Ojeda
says, “I| want someone to look at my
file and say, ‘Hey, he talked to every-
body.’ land maybe he'll hear some.
thing and BANG! that’s the arrest!”

That Johnny Rosell was destined to
walk on the dark side of life never
seemed|i in doubt. As a teen-ager in Bos-
ton, when his name was Filippo Sacco,
Roselli!was a runner for the numbers
racket. He helped his stepfather burn
down his home for the insurance mon-
ey. He was arrested at age 22 for steal-
ing about $25 from someone. Then he
changed his name and left for Chica-
go.

It would be 40 years until, in the late
1960s, Johnny Roselli would see his
mother! again, though he sent money
to his family through an intermediary
in Chicago so his sisters could attend
college.

By the late 1920s Al Capone was well
established in Chicago. Newspaper-
men, politicians and cops were on the
Capone payroll and a young man with

. Roselli’: s|street savvy had little trouble
’ finding suitable employment; he hired

on as ajlrumrunner with the Capone
gang. At age 26 Roselli was arrested

. for selling morphine to an undercover

agent, He was acquitted because, after

- Roseili’s|arrest, no one could seem to

find thelarresting officer or informant ~

‘easygoing, mild-mannered. He was
married for a time to an actress, but
they had no children. He became a
close friend of Harry Cohn, the!legend-
ary head of Columbia Pictures. iThe
two men sometimes vacationed to-
gether and Roselli always seemed to
know how to place a bet should Cohn
care to wager on a horse.
’ According to Bob Thomas’ ‘piogra-
phy of Cohn, “King Cohn,” the {movie
mogul once offered Roselli‘a job as a
producer. (In his book, Thomas’ dis-
guised Roselli’s identity at Roselli’s re
quest.) iz

Roselli bought twin star rubies, had-

Holiywood and began making life mi-

serable for movie studios by shaking -

down executives in return for labor
peace, Roselli stepped in and saved
Cohn from a lengthy strike.

When Cohnl refused to pay tribute to
Bioff and his union, Bioff tried to halt

production at Columbia by calling a.

sudden strike! Desperate, Cohn called
Roselli who marched into Bioff’s office
and: confronted the hoodium who sat

-behind his desk wearing a hat and

ing on the desk in front of him.

It was during his years in the Los

. Angeles and Has Vegas areas that Ro-

selli met the'lman who would make
him a household ‘name later in. life.
Robert Maheu! the ex-FBI agent -who
parlayed a Washington private’ eye
business into a stormy career as How-
ard Hughes’ inan in Las Vegas, ap-
proached Roselli on behaif of the CIA

"in 1960.

" (Another person Roselli met in that
era who would later surface to talk of
Roselli, Giancana and John F. Ken-
nedy was a young party girl named Ju-
dith Campbell.)

Maheu and Roselli would later tell

.Frank Church's Senate Intelligence

Committee theldetails of their plots to
kill Castro. Maheu told investigators he
had known Roselli since the late 1950s
and, while he didn’t know of his. un-
derworld connections, “it was cer--
tainly evident to me that (Roselli) was
able to accomplish things in Las Vegas
when nobody élse seemed to get the
same kind of attention. we

Over dinner at the Brown Derby in

: Beverly Hills 16 years ago, Maheu ex-

plained to Roselli that his government
needed his services, Roselli, who was
born on July 4, 1905, was nothing if not
patriotic. (Sam! Giancana once said,

- “Just wave a flag and Johnny’ll follow

you to any canal.”).Maheu recalled that

recommended to the CIA that it try to. -
prevent prosecution, but Roselli was
convicted of violating interstate gam-
bling laws. He went to jail, returning
in 1974 to Plantation to do battle ~

him. . .
In 1971 the CIA asked the Immigra
‘ tion and Naturalization Service to

“forestall public disclosure of Roselli’s
past operational activity with the CIA”
that might,occur if deportation pro-

‘eeedings were pursued. The INS

agreed to keep the CIA informed, but

ill fighting deportation.

I thought about that just the other:
day: ‘Jesus; what's Maheu thinking?’ ”
said another of Reselli’s brothers-in-
law, Peter.Cardillo of New Jersey. __.
The public doesn’t: know what Ma-
heu is thinking, whether he worries if
pro-Castro Cubans are exacting retri-
bution for sins of 16 years ago. Maheu’s

. secretary in Las Vegas says she doesn’t

know where her boss is or when he'll
be returning to his office. He report-
edly bas some business interest in
Egypt, a part of the world that seems

to hoid some fascination for the Castro

lotters; Giancana kept an apartment
in Beirut and, just before his death,

“told a friend he had some sort of deat

brewing there. And Roselli longingly
eyed the opening of gambling casinos
in the land of the new oil millionaires.

In Tampa, Been itih an-
other of the original Mahe’ up, also
refuses to talk with the press. But un:
dike the others, he did not testify be-
fore the Church committee so the pub-
lic has no inkling of his thoughts on
the Castro assassination attempts... ..
~ Whether Roselli’s killing was one of
retribution for a public or a private
matter, Johnny Roselli was a_testa-
ment to an era that has passed. His life,
which would have remained largely
unnoticed save for the Senate’s CIA
hearings, seemed straight from the
pages of a Mafia novel: allegedly
brought into the United States illegally
at the turn of the century, Roselli
clawed his way from the mean streets
of Boston and Chicago to the relative
glamor of Hollywood, Las Vegas and,
finally, Miami. Along the way, a simple
strain of patriotism—which impressed

THURSDAY, a

AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER _ ok

. — Who Killed John Roselli?

E'RE GOING TO tell you a little story now.
Once there was a President who was murdered.
His brother was murdered too. A long time after they
died some very strange facts came to light. It turned
out that while they were running the government,

the government was frying to get two Mafia mobsters _

to arrange the murder of someone else—the head of
a smail, hostile neighbor state. It also turned out that
one brether—the one who was President—appar-
ently had a girlfriend who was the girlfriend as well
of the mobsters. And orfe of the mobsters, whose
nickname was Momo, was prominent on the list of

criminals the President's brother was trying to put in

jail. The story may sound complicated, but life is com-
plicated, and the complications in this case got even
more so. For when a committee of the Congress
wanted the two mobsters to come and tell them some-
thing about.all this, only one of them—the one
named Johnny-— came. The other one, Momo, was.
murdered in his house a week before they wanted
him to testify. Johnny, however, told his story to one
committee in the Congress and then came back—qui-
etly—to tell some more things to another committee
which was in fact looking into the murder of the
President. Then Johnny went to Florida. Then no one.
could find him. Then some fishermen found him. |
Dead. In an oil drum.

But we haven’t told you the strangest part of all

yet, the part you're really not going to believe. It is
that when the great national political community of
solons, scribes, policemen, spies and managers of the
general: wellbeing heard about poor Johnny, they
said: “Oh, my goodness.” Some of them went farther,
of course. They said: “Fancy that!” But most of them
didn’t say anything at all except: “Yawn.”

Forgive us for lapsing into storybookese. We do it
for a reason which is that the simple unadorned facts
of the John and Robert Kennedy-Fidél Castro-CIA-
Mafia-Momo Giancana-Johnny Roselli-Judith Exner-
Church Committee-Schweiker Committee saga need

. to be put. forward in stark outline for their magni-
tude to be understood. is it really, as the sophisticated ~

wisdom goes, “paranoid” on our part to brood about
the suggestive and possibly monstrous interconnec-
tions between all these facts and to wonder why they
are not the object of intense press and government

- scrutiny? What accounts for the general indifference

in high places? What accounts for the eagerness with
which we all seem to accept that familiar tipoff that
we shall be hearing no more about the latest crime—
i.e., the pronouncement that Mr. Roselli’s dispatch to
an oil drum and Beyond had “all the earmarks of a

gangland slaying.” Those are. the good old “ear-

- marks” we only hear about when it is next to, certain, ' ment in particular can turn their attention away u
that we shall hear nothing more.

The supposition of course is that the Gang which

runs gangland has its reasons and its methods and

* ‘that, disagreeable as these may be, they really lie out-

_ Side the Proper realm of public concern because they

“The Data From po

amount to a system of justice which 1 only affects
those dumb enough to get involved in it in the first
place and 2) tends only to punish those who have’
committed what the rest of us would regard as hei-
nous crimes anyway. Not that these are things people

_Say—they're things people can be expected to as-

sume. But we think in this case the assumptions have
even less validity than they would have on a clear
day, which isn’t much. And that is because if we
know anything, we know that the Mafia operations in
which Messers. Giancana and Roselli figured had be-
come intertwined with the operations of the United
States government. Never mind that the decisions of
the early 1960s which made this so may rank among
the most abominable decisions ever taken in the U.S.
government. The plain fact js that, given the provoca-
tive and suggestive history of the two men, it is not
_possible for either Congress or the Executive Branch
‘to look the other way or to complaisantly accept the
earmarks-of-a-gangland-slaying bromide.

_ After Mr. Giancana was killed, the Church Commit-
tee inquired of the FBI whether its proposed meeting
with him had figured in his murder. The FBI re- .
ported that it had no evidence to this effect. The
_then-director of the CIA, William Colby, felt obliged
to state that the CIA had had nothing to do with the
murder--and Mr. Colby likewise pronounced the
other day that he was certain the CIA had not done in
Mr. Roselli. The mere fact that the questions, to
which these were meant to be the answers, had been
raised tells us, anyway, that much more in the way of .
inquiry is wanted. The newly formed Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence has now asked the Justice
Department to make an investigation of Mr. Roselli’s
death. We think the Department should comply and
that the investigation, despite FBI Director Clarence
Kelley's disclaimer .of jurisdiction, should have the
., Attorney General's personal attention. Such. atten-
tion is needed because of the elaborate and not en-
‘tirely reassuring history of relationships between the -

‘FBI and the CIA and the various participants in the
- whole sorry saga. We are not suggesting’ that any

agency of government—or even any of those agen-
cy’s fringe retainers —-were the murderers. We are
suggesting that there is an overlay of potentially em-
barrassing information sufficiently pervasive to keep

-an awful lot of. people from wanting to have this

thing aired. We also think that the Select Committee
should reserve the right to pursue the matter. Con-
gress, after all, can hardly be expected to sit idiy by

‘while its witnesses are being done in. Nor do we see .

how the public in general and the political establis

til we are all satisfied that a much greater effort has
been made by the government—which means both
the Executive Branch and the Congress—to discover
what elements were at play in this series of appalling
crimes and scandals.

ROSSELLI CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS

1955 Meets Maheu at insurance friend's home.

1960 Late July/early August. Maheu calls. Working for government. Recruit
Rosselli only. Meet Brown Derby, L.A., for lunch. Long talk about
project in Cuba. Rosselli wants verification.

2nd meeting, L.A., discuss further details, no discussion of specific
techniques. Plan to meet in N.Y. for verification.

Sept. 14, 1960. First meeting in N.Y. at old Plaza Hotel. Rosselli
‘introduced by Maheu to O'Connell. Rosselli "knew'' O'Connell worked
for the CIA. Rosselli agrees to work on Cuban project.

Sept. 25, 1960. Maheu and Rosselli travel to Miami to begin making
contact with Cubans to be recruited for mission.

(Between Sept. 25 and the Bay of Pigs, a series of recruitments, meetings,
and arrangements were made. The following is an outline of events that
is not necessarily in chronological order.)

i]
-- Meeting where Maheu is introduced to Trafficantp. Meeting
where Maheu is introduced to Giancana. Giancana was, according
to Rosselli, to only be a “back up man." Rosselli states .
Giancana had nothing to do with the actual operation. Trafficant¢
was used, according to Rosselli, as a translator.

-- Meeting with O'Connell, Maheu, Rosselli, and two iderhxg]steo

discuss the Cuban project.

-~ Rosselli, in his contact with the Cubans, "invents" the cover
story that he represents some Wall Street business interests who
want to see Castro eliminated. Rosselli trusts Cubans he has
recruited because they are part of the Bay of Pigs operation.

-- Ist attempt at assassination involved the use of pills. Maheu ~
and Rosselli met with Cuban #1 and #2 (?}. Maheu opened up his
briefcase and gave the pills with instructions for their use to
Cuban #1. Maheu also had $10,000 he gave the Cubans for doing
the project. Rosselli did not know of the money. Rosselli states
he received no remmeration for his work on the project, in fact,
he paid out $800 for gas for a speed boat to deliver two or three
man parties for guerrilla raids into Cuba.

-- Prior to Bay of Pigs there was no discussion of using guns to
assassinate Castro.

-- Rosselli's cover name was "John Ralston."

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 119
~- At different times, Cuban #1, #2, or #3 would propose different
projects. These would range from using plastic explosives to
booby trapping Castro's desk. Rosselli would relay these on
to Maheu, who, in turn, would contact the CIA. Most projects
were vetoed, but the CIA did supply a short wave radio to the
Cubans in Florida, to try and make contact with their people
in Havana.

-- Eventually, Rosselli felt the project had failed. There was no

specific point when it was announced. But, at sometime Rosselli
assumed the project, for whatever reason, had not succeeded.

First, some background information. ‘Yesterday,

August 9; Senators Inouye and Baker met with Directors
; : |

Kelley and Bush to discuss Roselli's death. The FBI

+

doesn't want to touch this with a ten-foot pole. | At the
meeting, sim Adams told ‘Inouye and Baker that the| FBI had
been told by Justice (Richard Thornburg) that it had’ no
jurisdiction in this case. Levi had, apparently, not been
consulted. ‘Senators Baker and Inouye (especially, Baker)
requested Kelley to take this up directly with Lewi. Today,
a letter|/was sent ‘to Levi, signed by Baker anq Inouye, urg-
ing Justice to authorizé FBI involvement. A copy. of that
letter is attached. | ,; .

One other point about the meeting. George Bush was

extremely upset about this case ‘and the allegations that
the CIA was involved in Roselli's death. He said ‘that he
_would personally contact Levi to request that the Depart -
ment grant jurisdiction to the FBI to “investigate.

the assassination. On November 24,
Mexico City cabled the names of known

On November 23, 1963, the CIA

to stop the planned arrest of Sylvia
Duran. Karamessinis speculated that this
was because CIA feared Cuba responsible
for assassination.

Headquarters equally concerned with
Duran on November 27 and warned
Mexico City station chief that U.S.
Ambassador pushing Cuban theory too
hard.

In December, 1963, Sullivan prepared a

FBI Legat in Mexico City cabled
FBI Headquarters on November 24
that U.S. Ambassador felt Cubans
participated in assassination

not desirable and would only

The CIA investigation reflected a
Soviet orientation, with exhaustive
studies of Oswald's activities in

re Soviet Union. There is no corres-
ponding CIA analysis of Oswald's con-

tacts with pro and anti Castro groups
in U.S.

Book V, p. 61- In December, 1963, the CIA learned that

63

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 165

a Cuban American had crossed the border
from Texas into Mexico, on November 23
and arrived in Mexico City on November 25.
He stayed in a hotel until the evening of

November 27, when he departed on a

regularly scheduled Cubana airlines flight
to Havana using a Cuban courtesy visa and
an expired U.S. passport. He was the only
passenger on the flight. In March, 1964
the Agency received a report from a

source which alleged that the same Cuban
American had received a permit to enter
Mexico City on November 20 in Tampa,
Florida. The same source said the Cuban
American was somehow involved in the
assassination.

The Agency did not follow up on this
report other than to ask a Cuban
defector about his knowledge of the
Cuban American's activities. The FBI
did investigate the reported unusual |
travel but did not fully report the
results of their investigation to their
Warren Commission. Their investigation
showed that this individual had lived

in Tampa and Key West and was pro-Castro.
He had traveled to Cuba in May of 1962
and had a brother in the Cuban military
who was studying in the Soviet Union.

On November 17, 1963, the Cuban American
was at a get-together at the home of a
member of the Tampa chapter of the Fair
Play for Cuba Committee. This was the
same Fair Play for Cuba Committee that
Oswald had possibly contacted in May of
1963.
Book V, p. 63-64

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 166

In March of 1964, the Warren
Commission requested from Director
Hoover information on certain pro-
Castro and anti-Castro organizations
which were active in the U.S.-
including the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee, and Alpha 66, among
others. The Bureau furnished less
than a full and satisfactory
response and did not disclose the
fact that the CIA had operational
interests in certain of the entities
inquired about.
Book V, p. 65

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page i167

The FBI reports on Alpha 66 furnished
the Warren Commission noted the attack
on the Soviet vessel in March of 1963
but did not detail that group's
continued activity in planning and
carrying out their military operations
against Cuba. The FBI reports did not
show that Alpha 66 had been involved
with the New Orleans anti-Castro train-
ing camp.
Book V, p. 65

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 163

It is known that the CIA took an
interest in the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee with which Oswald was
associated. According to Bureau
documents, the Agency advised the
Bureau that they were considering

the use of disinformation that might
embarass the Committee in areas where
the Committee had support.
Book V, p. 72

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 169

In late July 1964, an FBI informant
reported that the CIA was meeting with
AMLASH for the purpose of assassinating
Castro. Informant also reported that
AMLASH was unhappy with the CIA's efforts
and that Attorney General Kennedy had
refused to support the plan but that the
plan had not been completely put to rest.
This information was not disseminated
outside the Bureau at the request of the
informant. But the Bureau notations
indicate that the Bureau was Looking
into an underworld plot against Castro
that might be coincidental with the

-AMLASH plan. The Bureau had first been

informed of AMLASH-CIA meetings in
October 1963. That information did not
indicate assassination involvement.
Book V, p. 74-75 The AMLASH operation was insecure

prior to the Fitzgerald meeting
with AMLASH, a meeting that
Fitzgerald was urged not to under-
take by several in the Agency.

Individuals outside rye CIA had
been brought into the operation,
and the Agency learned that one
of these individuals was in
clandestine contact with Cuban
intelligence (Cable from
European station to CIA Head-
quarters, 3/18/65).
Book V, p. 78 Victor Espinosa, a Cuban exile, involved

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page if2

in the transporting explosives to New
Orleans in 1963, contacted INS with
information about the AMLASH operation.
This information was turned over to the
FBI.which informed the CIA. Both
agencies interrogated Espinosa in June
of 1965 and found that he knew that
AMLASH and others were planning a coup
which involved the assassination of
Castro and that the CIA had been
involved with AMLASH and others in the
planning.

Espinosa and AMLASH were life-long friends
but during the interrogation he gave no
indication that he was aware of the 1963
AMLASH-CIA meetings. Espinosa's
information noted in the 1967 IG Report
suggests a link between the AMLASH
operation and the CIA plots to assassinate
Castro using underworld contacts.
Therefore, Espinosa's information raised
the possibility that underworld figures
who were aware of the Harvey plots may
have been aware of the AMLASH operation.
CIA reaction to this interrogation was

to terminate the operation immediately.
Book V, p. 79

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page i?3

CIA had FBI files on Espinosa detailing
his involvement with anti-Castro exiles
and underworld figures who were operating
the guerrilla training camps in New

In mid-1965 the CIA interrogated Tepedino,
New York jeweler, who had been involved
with the AMLASH operation from the
beginning. The report concluded that

the subject was. deceptive during the
interrogation and withheld pertinent
information in one or more relevant
areas. Tepedino lied in response to
questions dealing with AMLASH's and his
ties to Cuban intelligence. Tepedino
stated that AMLASH had no plan to over-
throw Castro. Tepedino stated AMLASH
had strong connections with Cuban
intelligence and was probably cooperating
with it in various ways. Although
AMLASH never mentioned these connections
to his CIA case officers; Teledino

stated that AMLASH had mentioned them

‘to him and almost everyone else he had

met.
Book V, p.

The FBI made the connection between
Espinosa's 1963 activities and the
fact that in 1965 he was knowledgeable
of CIA involvement in plans to
assassinate Castro. However, there

is no evidence that either the CIA or
FBI investigated this connection

until 1967.
Book V, p. 79

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page i?6

Although the CIA had received information
that AMLASH was a provocation there is

no evidence that the CIA investigated

its fall 1963 meetings ‘with AMLASH and
the assassination of President Kennedy.

Book V, P. 80 A client of Morgan's had informed him

that the United States had attempted

to assassinate Castro in the early
1960's and that Castro had decided to
retaliate. This information was passed
to Drew Pearson who in turn attempted
to have Chief Justice Warren look into
it but he declined.
Book V, P. 81

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page i?d

Supervisory personnel assigned to the
assassination investigation have

which touch upon Cuban involvement

in the assassination or of Cuban
retaliation for the. CIA assassination
plots.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page i79

According to Secretary of State Rusk
in his testimony before the Warren
Commission, 6/10/64, he stated there

was "very considerable concern" in Cuba

immediately following the assassination
as to whether Cuba would be held
responsible for the assassination and
what effect the assassination might
have on Cuba's position and security.

On March 21, 1967, WFO send Headquarters
10 copies of a blind memorandum which
stated Castro employed assassination
teams for the purpose of removing
President Kennedy. Morgan's clients

were also aware of the identity of
individuals sent to the United States

for that purpose. He understood that two
such individuals were now in the state

of New Jersey. The transmittal slip is

Okay now, what happened

Castanyava..

Castanyava

' Castanyava was the chief of the Navy.

And Fidel offered you a job or something, can you
go into that?

Well he was very fond of everything German. He

said he read and my father, you know, tried
to pacify the tourists, the passengers on the ship
because they were terrified. They thought they were
being invaded. So I helped my father pacify the
tourists and it was really a funny scene. - Then I
steered Fidel to my father's cabin and we went to
dinner and Fidel started to play kneesies under the |
table. And this was February 28, 1959 on the cruise.

And he offered you a job, right?

Yes, after about 5 hours on board ship we went back
up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged
gifts, and my father and Fidel seemed to get along
very well. My father is diplomatic and they

-exchanged plaques and my father's silver ashtray and

stuff like that. And he asked me, he asked my father
if since I was bilingual if I could go, come back,
return to Cuba to be his secretary since he was
getting German mail and he did not speak German and
he assured me that I would be safe and set up in an
office, and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I had
friends in Cuba anyway.

How old were you then?

Nineteen, nineteen years old.

Did you get off the ship and stay there?

No, I went back to New York. Fidel, on the bridge,
asked me for my phone number and address in New York

and said he would call me, and I just, I didn't
believe it.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page i164

father took off that night for Germany again and
the phone ring, and it rang at 1 o'clock in the
morning. I guess the previous...

FS: Well he went back to Germany with the ship, right?
Where did you! go?

ML: I was living with my brother in New York City.

My brother was a translator for the United Nations
and I was alone living in New York City going to
the Merchantson Banker School.

FS: Well how did you get back to New York City from

Havana?
ML: ' On my father's ship. It was the last stop on the
eruise of about 5 or 6 stops.
FS: Oh, in other words the, in other words the ship left
: that night, left Havana that night...
ML: Yeah.
FS: went over to New York and then from New York went

back to Europe, right?

ML: Yes. Yes. I |thought about Fidel and he pointed out
this is my Havana and I guess I was impressed. I
was young, I don't know. And I thought that...

FS:

He called, he
time you were

called you, he knew just about what
going to arrive in New York and when

you got there jhe called you, what, the same, the same
day you got there?

ML: The same day our ship arrived, three days later. And I
just picked up the phone and the Havana operator said
one moment please, the Prime Minister is on the phone,
on the line, and I heard some shouting and then I
heard "hello".

Did he speak Cuban or English to you?

ML: He spoke broken English in his hoarse voice. I guess
he was giving a lot of speeches at that time. And he
asked me, "Hello Marita, you think I don't call? I
think about you very much and I call. I keep my word.
I want to prove to you that one man's Cuban word I keep."

So, I was as surprised, I was very surprised.

How. long was it did you leave New York to go to
Havana?

Fidel said to me, I said is this really you Fidel,
and he said yes. I am in Havana Hilton, you call

me back in room 2408, and I said no, alright. I
believe you I said because how else would you have
my number. He said "I want you come back. I think
about you and I will send a plane, my plane, and you
come back.'"' And it was a joke really, I liked the
Cocoa Glace, it's an ice cream in a cocoanut shell,
and he had sent to my father's ship a case of it so
I would have enough for the return trip home because,
I don't know, I just talked about Havana, the island
in general. So I, and I still didn't believe him
that he would send the plane.

Did he send the airplane?

Yes.

What kind of an airplane did he send?
A Cubana airliner with...

Four engines? .

Yes, with two men and two men came to the, my door.
I was living at 344 West 87th Street at the time, on
the second floor, and my brother was at a UN party
and I was home alone studying. Oh no, in fact I was
reading a Herbert L. Mathews article on Fidel Castro
and Cuba when the doorbell rang, and it was Jesus

and Pedro :
and they showed me identification. One came in military
uniform, the other in civilian clothes. One smiled,
one didn't. One said, "Are you ready?" And one said,
"We go now. Fidel. want very much to see you.”

(Laughter) .

And I said I didn't finish my homework yet. I was like.
in shock. I didn't know what to do. So they said they
were staying in a hotel, that they would, the plane
would leave tomorrow, please be ready. I, meanwhile I

‘haven't even unpacked, you know, from the cruise. My

HY 50955 DoclId:32423630 Page 1866

(contd.) ‘I hadn't even unpacked because I was worred about
missing two days at school.

FS: Yeah.
ML: So-I went...
FS: Well these are incidentals anyway, so, what'd you

do, you went to the airport? What airport did the
airplane, was the airplane at?

ML: Uh, LaGuard, which is not Kennedy, it was at that

time named.something else. Idlewild, right?

FS: Idlewild, yeah. .

ML: And...

FS: It was Idlewild airport, that's where they had the

: airplane, Cubana Airlines? ;

ML: Yeah, Cubana Airlines. Got on the plane...

FS: How many people where on the airplane?

ML: _ ° Me, a steward, a pilot and a co-pilot and the two
guards. . ;

FS: Ha, ha, had -- that's funny. Go ahead.

ML: So anyway, I mét Fidel and that's when I got involved.

background.

Now when ,you went back to Havana you saw Fidel where?
Cause we'll go over this lightly.

I was in the.

At the Hilton? |

I was driven by black limousine right to the Hilton.

And that's where Fidel was staying at the Hilton, right?

Yes, he was having an argument in his suite with Chez
Raoul and some Americans.

He was having some argument with some Americans . Do
you know who the Americans were? .

Yes.
Who were they?

One lady attorney trying to promote something, Muriel...

.Oh this was more business or something like that?

- Yes business. Everybody was trying to promote this

and that with Fidel.

Yes, well that's immaterial.

So then I was told to go in the room and wait and the
door locked. And I was in there, in his suite, and
Fidel came in and I missed him and he missed me and
the rest is going to be in the book if I ever write it.
You'll write it don't worry. Alright now... ~

If I live.

Do you know approximately when you met me?

A couple months, or two months, or three months after
that.

No,That was very, I think you met me around what, April?

April, right.
April of 1959, right?

That's where, when I saw...

That's what I said, a couple months...
Right.

right after that.

In April, right. And this is where we made contact
and so forth and then we saw each other a few times

after that.

In the coffee shop.

‘In the coffee shop and this is when you were recruited

to go ahead. and spy for the United States and so forth
and, were you ever introduced or, to Colonel Nickels?

Yes.

Do you know who Colonel Nickels is, right. He was
the Colonel who was military attache with the American

_ Embassy in Havana, Cuba at that time, right?

Yes...

Okay. Then you started your spy thing and so forth
and so forth, alright?

Um hum.

We'll go ahead and jump a little bit and so forth.
There were several meetings that Fidel had in the
Hilton with some of the people of the staff. I was
present at the meeting, right?

Right. ,

And, one of the time that Fidel was talking to the
staff concerned the gambling casinos and American

‘business interests in. Cuba, right?

Right.

And it was stated that he was going to run all the
vacketeers out of...

Out of Cuba.

Cuba. All the American businesses;were going to go
ahead and be nationalized because it was Cuba and the
Cuba for the Cubans. :

Right.

And so forth. And then it was suggested about well
you know the American government may not like it.
You're gonna have all the American business interests
put pressure on the State Department which would put
pressure on him and that they would be up in arms and
they would have the agents, they would send new agents
into Cuba because the CIA at that time was very close,
closely contacted, at least certain people in the CIA
had contact with the 26th of July movement. As a

_ matter of fact that they were exchanging information

with Castro...

Uh hum.

which enabled him to outwit many of the other groups
so really CIA helped Fidel quite a bit in this power
struggle that was going on in Cuba at that time. So
Fidel, with the help of CIA... .

Yes.

‘got to be the ruler of Cuba. Now...

I would, what about, where did Fidel get most of his
guns from?

Well, you know...
To lead the revolution?

Right, you know, so forth. That's a story which we
won't have to go into and so forth because we just
(unintelligible) briefly over it. And then there
came a period of time where Fidel in all his
popularity and so forth was, now Fidel with you - he
made approaches to you, right, and so forth?

Mm-Hmm.

You know, and you liked him and you actually in
liking him like a young girl thought for the future
that here's a man that I, you admired, that you
started to get an affection for him and so forth, -
and really you thought of marriage, right?

Mm-hmm.

And in the process of being close with him, being as
the man's intelligent, dynamic and so forth, he did
force his attentions on you and naturally he seduced
you. You didn't want to but it happened.

Yes.

And you had nobody to go to because, hey, you're in
his Cuba, right? — :

I was in his Cuba. alright.

Right, now also what we were getting in this Senate
Intelligence Committee has got is the things that
Fidel has stated against the United States government
if they tried to interfere with the revolution and so
forth when the new election time comes because at that
time the President of the United States was Eisenhower
and it looked like that the Democrats were going to
win the election and he felt that if a new government,
which was discussed among the top military people, if

“the new government came in and if they decided that they.

didn't like Fidel's:- policy, which Fidel was saying what
he was going to do for Cuba on an international scale,

that if the United States government decided to go and

turn against him and put pressure on him he would do

‘ likewise to the United States government. And he was

going to export his revolution in Latin America. These

are the things that you heard...

powerful people yet they have done nothing with the
problem that you have had right now with you, three
times there's been an attempt on your life, isn't

300 apartments, my husband had access to files. Each

Soviet file read the same -- Permanent Mission of the ©

Very friendly. We exchanged gifts and we went to
dinner, and we were invited to the U.N., and we
exchanged. .

In other words you were being guided into doing
certain things..

No.
This one particular FBI agent.
This one particular agent told us daily ‘what to do.

Alright now did he give you a code name or a code,
any particular code?

My name, Mariuch.
Mariuch was the name he gave, that he gave you, right?.
Mariuch.
Alright, it sounds Italian. Mariuch is Italian.
Well he... .
Maria.
He is Italian, too.
The agent?
Yes.

Alright, now, when,did you ever make an entry into
this top KGB agent's apartment?

This one particular, there were several. This wasn't
the only one. - .

Well, let's talk, let's talk about, the, general.

Oleg was, in other words my husband and I discussed

It could be very dangerous.
Yeah, yeah, I said...
You could get caught, you could be killed.

I said suppose, you know, we're working in the precinct
on a local level - that's breaking and entering, right?
And my husband and I dis, you know we discussed it.
Now, Uncle Al - as we started to call this...

FBI agent?

FBI agent, said "Look, he's a very bad person, we lost
him and we found him and he's in the building and we
want to get.in the apartment. We feel he has, for
national security reasons, we want to enter that
apartment. Louis, will you cooperate?!" You know?

And my husband said, "Alright". :

Did he said he had to discuss it with you?
They discussed it in front of me.

I mean did your husband say he had, he would discuss
it with you about...

No, no, but he did, but he didn't ask me because I
asked my husband later, I said, "Louis, if you refuse.
to do what Al tells us to do, me as a lookout and
Louis opening the doors for them", Louis said, Louis
is my husband, said "What do you want me to do, get

‘subpoenaed? They'll subpoena me if I don't do it. So

I'll go along with it.'’
So it, it was agreed...
It was agreed that he would do it.

Alright, now what did your husband do. Did he open the
door for the agents?

Yes he did.
Did he go in, for what, one agent, two agents?
Two agents.

Two agents. Was Uncle Al one of those agents?

He stood at the door.

He stood at the door.

That is in case they'd come back he'd...
Right.

The fact that he is the manager of the building
standing there with two repairman.

But that he was assured, he was assured, right. -
That these two men were repairmen?

That, that just in case something went wrong with the
5 cars assigned to this job that one car would radio
that Oleg Likichev was leaving the Mission at this
moment, he is getting into his car, he is on the way
up 2nd Avenue to his residence. .

Right, and they...

You've got approximately 7 to 8 minutes...

Minutes to do what you gott do and get the hell out.
Do, and get out.

Okay.

So, my husband stood in the door and I was in the
staircase and they went in with a, a case that looks

like a television repair case which had high power
cameras.

Right.

And they, my husband was always annoyed because they
were sloppy.

The Soviets are very trained, they would leave a
cigarette on an ashtray. If you knocked it over they
know immediately someone was in the apartment.

Now, when the agents, before your husband opened the
door with the pass key, did the agents look the door
over to see if there was any powder marks, tapes,
hairs, or anything, or something leaning against the
door to signify that possibly when the Cuban general,
this, not Cuban general, this Russian general, who is
a top KGB agent...

Yes.

wanted to see if somebody made an entry they would

leave something on the door.

Yes.

They inspected the door, right? And they didn't find
anything? ;

Right...

Right. So they opened the door. In other words, what-
ever they touched... -

But they made a mistake inside on one break-in and
that...

Alright, now, no let's not jump. We're, you were on
this one particular thing.

Alright.

These people did go in, they did what they had to do
with the cameras and so forth, evidently these were
hidden.... ; ;

Yeah.

cameras that they installed some place in there, right? |

No, it was microfilm.

Well there were cameras...

FS: You don't know for sure, though?

ML: I'm not sure, my husband...

FS: No, but you do know about the cameras?

ML: . Yes.

FS: - Alright, but there is a possibility they brought

bugging devices because it's logical they would
bring bugging devices.

- ML: I think sometimes, plenty of times they wanted to
plant a bug. .
FS: Sure.
ML: Especially in the television, the cable TV, the...

for the cable TV.

FS: Oh, for the cable TV. Well, yeah, alright.

ML: That way they thought they could tune in to them
transmitting.

FS: Yeah. Alright, now, how long did they stay in, to
the General's apartment?

ML: In the apartment, approximately 10-15-20 minutes.

FS: ‘Then they left, your husband closed the door, did he
wipe his fingerprints off the door? Do you know?

ML: No, but my husband would usually put the edge of the:
rug back the way he found it.

FS: Right, in other, everything...

ML: It was turned over...

FS: had to be placed back the same way it was.

ML: And he would watch them and they were rough.

ML: This worried my husband because this would...

FS: -Yeah, it would make...

ML: They knew...

FS: Make them know there was an entry.

ML: Right.

about other entries. We'll get one at a time.

The other entry that's outstanding is Soviet..

Yeah, go ahead, keep talking. 7

Very Americanized Soviet, handsome, married with a 10
year old daughter. I forget his name. TI have them
all at home. And, I nicknamed him "The Tennis Player"
because he use to do a lot of jogging and play tennis
every morning to make contacts with Americans, and try
to recruit, I guess, gather information at the same
time... He spoke English without an...

(unintelligible)

Fluently, without.an accent, down to curses and slang
and everything else. His wife.

You got friendly with him also?

No, he even suggested to take my husband to a massage
parlor and he was way out, too much way out.

In other words, play with girls?

And they did it sloppy because this particular Soviet,
the tennis player, made a formal complaint to the

working.

Oh, hm-mmm.
You understand?
Yeah.

And this tennis player called up and demanded a
detective. I was working up there and the detectives

‘were hot on a homicide and I answered the phone and

here it was the tennis player calling to make a formal
complaint of breaking and entering his apartment. I
had him on the phone. :

And he didn't know it was you.

And I died, I tried to disguise my voice and he kept
on talking and talking and talking and I couldn't
disguise my voice. I was afraid he would know that I,
it was me. I took the complaint in other words.

working for this police department in this precinct.

cases, interrogation.

FS: And at that time you were answering phone calls that
were coming in?

ML: And typing, and- doing other things but I don't really
want to get those guys involved because they...

FS:- No, I just wanted, wanted them to know what you were
doing in the police department.

ML: I was an auxiliary sergeant.

FS: : Answering the phones. Okay.

ML: Auxiliary is a volunteer police.

FS: Right, good enough. Now what other entries did you make
with them. That's two -- that you specified.

ML: Two. The rest I didn't want to go along with because
I was a little afraid so my.

FS: Things were getting a little hot for you.

ML: — Yes, because we had too many Russians, we had the
Albanians, we had the Red Chinese.

FS: All living in that building?

ML: All living in the same building. There was, it was

was a merry-go-round.

FS: : In other words,

ML: We had, in one day about four different agencies
watching people.

FS: In and out of the building.

“ML: And we didn't know if we were coming or going.
FS: Yeah. .
ML: We lived on the second floor. We had a view of the

street and we would signal to the, across the street
surveillance apartment, apartment, you know. We'd
see the cars pull up and the cars leave.

just didn't want to get caught because it was a heck

on one floor and if anyone of them walked out when my

But your husband continued to work with the agency,
right? .

Yes. We, we took, we ID'd photos.. We watched for

‘cars. We watched their movement. It was day and night.

You did a lot of surveillance work on these people
but you yourself, personally, wanted to try to keep

Yes.

How long did this last?. Over a period of how long?
1969 to 1976.

All these years?

Yes.

That's doing surveillance on these people.

Yeah. We were...

How about the Albanians now, tell me about the code.
The Albanians, the Albanians we got very friendly with
a Mr. Koyani, Ambassador to the Mission, the U.N., and
the Albanians are not as elite as the Russians are.
The Russians dry clean their own clothes, burn their
own garbage, have no photos, personal things in the
apartment. The Albanians are more, they allow their
children to watch television. The Soviets don't. We
convinced the Albanians who had a mission on their
mission, which they blocked a complete fire exit was

on the 2lst floor of the Newberry. They lived in the
apartments on the 20th floor and the 22nd floor. And

HW 50955 DoclId:32423630 Page 217
FS:

FS:

FS:

~36-

they had about 30, 30 families who resided there and
their mission was there. And we became very friendly
with them because of one incident, especially my
husband, took, went to see his mother and left me in
charge of the building. That same day they had a so-
called demonstration where the demonstrators had a
25-minute picketing right to picket. The demonstra-
tion turned into a bloody riot where they burned flags
and everything and the Albanians came down. They all
are armed. They're all armed, and they agitated the
rioters out on the street. And I was alone with only
my basic police training and my wits, really, and a
panicking doorman and my kids. I was just alone. I,
the first thing I looked out the window when I heard
the shooting I called the Bureau and I said, "Get me
Al Chestone fast." I said I don't have Louis here.
I said I need help. I have a demonstration. I don't
know what to do. And there were about 500 people
throwing bricks, bottles, everything through the plate
glass windows. Burning American flags and Albanian
flags because of something that happened in Albania.
Those that defected here started this demonstration.
So then I, things got out of hand, the doorman was
hurt with a brick. I saw blood, and the Albanian
Ambassador and five top officials agitated these
people from inside the lobby with fists. Very
unprofessional-like.

Yeah.

So I physically pulled them by their coats and told
them, "Get upstairs, get upstairs and get yourself
back into the mission", because tenants were walking
through the lobby and we were going to get hurt by
flying glass and everything else. And I had no help.
The police were outside of the line... .

Marita, what we're going into details is something
that is a story.

Oh, alright.
So we'll go ahead and just bypass that.

Anyway, the Albanians Al was interested into, and
especially because they were admitting the Red Chinese
into the United Nations, which they did. It was that
speech, which I have the original copy of. Ambassador
Rocco Nocco - sounds crazy, but that's his name, Rocco

Nocco, and they were, they were sloppier, and the
agent Al Chestone told me convince them, you know, .
case ‘em, keep going. up and down the steps, what
time they throw their garbage out. Garbage was

the most valuable source of information for the

Bureau, and that was...

Garbage and trash.

Trash. Chicken bones, codes, diapers, whatever, you
know, and that was my job because I had the patience.
Now the FBI supplied me with bandaids and gloves,
flashlights, batteries and the whole thing, because

I convinced the Albanians that the compacter, which
was the disposal system in the building from 31 floors
down -- in other words when they threw their garbage
out that it would come out in brick form, block form,
brick crushed, which in fact was not true.

But they believed it?

They believed it. They trusted us. Louis and I were
the only ones allowed in the mission. We were. the
only ones. ;

Now this mission is that building you were talking
about. : :

That's still. there.

Still there.

Very much there. That's the code that you have.
Right. . .

So, I started, made it a every two hour routine to go
after midnight when they put their garbage out in the
hall, pick up the bags. Take them down to the service
entrance and take the bags at home, take ‘em home.

And go through the orange peels and chicken bones and
gather torn up letters, this was before they got smart
and bought a shredder (unintelligible). And I would
turn this garbage letter, in other words, I would ©
past it together and give it to the Bureau and some

of these letters turned out to be very valuable. Among
them was one code, now... ;

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 219
FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

FS:

~38-

I would assume that these letters that were in code.
they would be classified material. Otherwise it
wouldn't be in code. : .

Very valuable, yes. The...
And this was turned over to who?

To Al Chestone. The first code I got, I just got on
a nunch lucky. Because it was just at the time when
the Red Chinese entered the United States, first

came here. Mr. Huang Yua, and I met them. We met
them first before anybody met them, Louis and I.

And that same night the code came down at 3:00 in the
morning and I just had a hunch and I got up and I
said, "Louis I can't sleep, I'm going down and do

_some work. Give me the keys to the compacter room."

So I went downstairs and I waited and sure enough
around 3:30 these bags. started to come down from the
2lst floor. .

3:30 in the morning?

3:30 in the morning because Al said watch them
closely, because of the Red Chinese. And I shut
the machine off and I got these, I got this code,
I caught it in other words, but it....

This is the code you turned over to me?

This is the first code, the very first code, at the
risk of having my hands chopped off because if I

‘didn't shut that machine off in time I could have

been hurt. But I got it. The first code was very
valuable. It was sent to Washington.

(End of tape - side 2).

...these bags of stuff and if you hadn't. have turned
off the machine you would have got your hand either
chopped up or cut off, and so forth. What did, were
you saying about Al, Uncle Al?. an

Uncle Al slept and I did the work, and by the time I
got upstairs and took the orange peels and everything
out of the garbage and separated the letters and

every tiny little piece with tweezers and everything,

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 220
-39-

put it all in a box, right down to every piece. I
ruined my rugs and everything. And Uncle Al would
come at 8:30, 9:00 in the morning and I would still
be up separating the garbage and he'd be all fresh
and ready for work and-I had just come back from the
garbage room. . And...

FS: You stayed awake all night?

ML: Yeah, with the tweezers and I use to run out of
skotch tape which was frustrating cause I couldn't
stick these letters togethers without skotch tape,
so he brought me a big box of skotch tape which -
was very kind of him. Then I would give it to him
and he'd, he'd have coffee, tea and toast or whatever.
And I'd say, "Now I want to go to sleep." And he'd
say, "No, no, no, wait a minute. Mr. So-and-so,
or Berzofsky, we want to get a line on Mr. Berzofsky.

FS: Who was Mr. Berzofsky?
ML: ' Berzofsky, the Second Secretary to the Union of the
Soviet Socialist Republic.
FS: What was his first name, do you know?
’ ML: Mmmm, I forgot...
_FS: That's alright, it don't matter.
ML: I forgot really. “But we were very close to him. His

wife was a surgeon in the Soviet mission and she was,
she's, she's adorable. She's nice, she's sweet and
she has a lovely daughter, Irene, who turned out to
have liver cancer. She was a little girl when I first
met her, like my daughter. My daugher played with her,
they took piano lessons together, exchanged books, and
the little girl, at sixteen, Irene was sent back to
the Soviet Union with liver cancer. I got very close
to the mother, the mother was heartbroken, the father
was heartbroken. I guess like any mother and father
when their only child turns out to have liver cancer.
She's diagnosed as such in the Soviet Union and they
asked me to get medicine, pain killers for Irene. I

their daughter on with the permission of
the FBI. We exchanged jewelry, clothes, and everything
else. We were just one mother to another mother.

Their little girl in trouble, mine not in trouble and
it was little things like that that I would get very
involved with. I don't know...

Morita let me ask you this here, did the agents ever
tell you to go out with any of the diplomats in the
mission?

Well, now we have to go back to Oleg, Oleg Likichev.
And who is he again?

He was the KGB spy that they lost and thought he, they
thought he was still residing in Washington, the out-
side of Washington, D. C., in Virginia. He ‘was
supposed to have last been seen in Virginia somewhere
and all of a sudden they picked him up in our building,
as being in our building. They lost him and they were
furious, the Bureau, and they wanted us very close to
him. -And he, we had a lot of evenings together we
spent with him, dinners, and he came to us,

In other words he asked you to go out, did he ask
(unintelligible) ;

Well, Oleg, Oleg, let's just say, I don't know if it
was a game they were playing or if they were doubles
or what. They talked a lot about the State of
Washington, residing in the State of Washington.
They also knew I had diamonds and he asked me,
(unintelligible) “Can you get me diamonds?"

What did he call you?

Llonka Marischa, Tlona Marita.

Oh, that's in Russian?

Yes. And we always exchanged Russian words and I

know a few, enough to get by on. All of a sudden,
you know, he was interested in diamonds. He had a

' fascination for diamonds. His wife, she was kind

of sweet on my husband he was kind of sweet on me
and I kept telling Uncle Al this thing is going to
get out of hand. I said all of a sudden he wants

EW 50955 Bocld:32423630 Page 222
-41-

diamonds, and Al, what do I do. Go ahead, talk to
him about diamonds. So I said Oleg, what do you
mean by diamonds? He said uncut stones for cash.

I am a Soviet official, I cannot go into a jewelry
store like you and buy them. I want diamonds. I'm
willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for them.

I said, I said tell me why, Oleg. And he said,
“Money, why does anybody want diamonds." I said it's
a good enough reason. So I said, "Hey, Louis, what
can we do for Oleg about his diamonds?" And Louis
said we'll figure something out. And then Oleg said,
this was at a dinner party up in their house. Hot
diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So

he was serious, he was dead serious. He said he
would buy them for cash. ;

FS: How serious was he? Did you ever get any for him?.

ML: Well it got this far. We told Uncle Al the next
' morning. I said, "Uncle Al, I got a surprise for

you. You're gonna have to come up with some hot
diamonds. A hundred thousand dollars worth because |
I promised Oleg that I would get them for him since
he can't buy them. Oleg wants diamonds."’ And I
said if you can put two and two together maybe this
guy will defect because he's talking about the State
of Washington. I said but you have to be careful,
I have to be careful, no? So Al'said I'll get you
the diamonds. You tell him to get the cash ready.
So Uncle Al went to an underworld source and got”
the diamonds. Uncle Al made a boo-boo and Oleg, the
day of the exchange I was supposed to make the sale
in tthe apartment, Oleg was at a sports meeting in
Washington,D.Cc. Uncle Al.said, "I've got to give
these diamonds back to the underworld or give them
the cash."" I.said, "Listen, I told you tomorrow,
not today, Al. Tomorrow, because Oleg told us he's
going to this soccer meeting in Washington, D.C.
Alright whatever the kind of meeting it is. He is
in Washington, D. C." "Oh is he?" I said, "Yes,
he is." Right. Anyway, Uncle Al started to panick
because he was in my house with a hundred thousand
dollars worth of uncut, hot diamonds.

FS: By himself?

ML: By himself, and I was supposed to get the cash from
Oleg. Oleg said on a Thursday and Uncle Al came on

BW 50955 Bocld:32423630 Page 223
-42-

a Wednesday and the whole thing...
FS: : So what happened?

ML: fell through. Al said he had to give them back to
the underworlds, to his source. So he took them
back and then Oleg, you know, I had to talk my
way out of it. It was just one of the flubs. But
anyway after I left my husband Oleg kept asking for
me, kept coming directly to the apartment and say-
ing, "Louis, I don't believe you two split, you two
go, she left. I don't believe it." And my husband
said "yes, she did leave. It's her own problems,
Oleg, you know, forget about it." And he said,
"No, it's not possible. You must stay together.
You must stay together." Anyway, he kept coming,
about four times and asking my husband, until my
husband made a joke of it and said Oleg wants to
see you. I mean he's made it damm plain that he
wants to see you. In other words if you're
finished I'll take over. Where is she living? My
husband tells him I'm living on 88th Street. Now
I talked to my husband and I said what did you do
that for? Tell him I'm living on 88th Street?

You know, because I know he wants to go out with
me. You can feel it, I can feel it, the, you know?
So I call up,Uncle Al meantime is transferred to
Newark, I get another case agent. Louis gets a
case agent for the building and he works alone,
without me. The other agent is John Kotter.

FS: With the FBI?

ML: ' FBI, 69th Street. I call up John Kotter. I said,

. ’ "John, I hear your taking Al's place", and I meet
him. Drop things, start things, drop things,
different assignments, then we get to Oleg. I said
look, Oleg is bothering Louis. He wants to go out
with me. And John Kotter says, "Beautiful, that is
a beautiful setup. Let's call him up." I said,
"Hey, wait a minute. Either do this sophisticated,
alright? First I'll send him a Christmas card and
sign it Ilonka Marischa, you know? I'll put my
phone number on the bottom, something you know?

Or I'1l happen to be there when he's going into the
“s, : building, or I'll bump into him." I said you don't
“ just call him up. You know that's going to be like
a setup because I’ve been avoiding him. So, anyway,
he tells, he outlines the whole thing. I said what

have you.got planned, John. And he says, “Do you

realize what a bomb this is? This top KGB spy wants
you?” And I said, "Well", I say “he's not really my
type.", I said but again, the best interests of the
country, but how far do you want me to go? And he
said "all the way" I said what is all the way? He
said, "You start with a Christmas card." Well the
Christmas card was answered by Oleg going to Louis
and saying, "I got Ilonka's Christmas card. Where is
she living, Louis?" You know, so John talked me into |
calling the mission. I call up the mission, across
from 19th precinct, and I said, "Oleg, this is Llonka
Marischa. Hello darling", you know, and this, this
and this. And I said oh boy everything is wired and
everything from the mission anyway. But he's top dog
there. He is top dog in the mission. He has the
say. He's a very important person in the Soviet
mission. Anyway, John okays a telephone coil pickup
that I have on my phone to a Soni tape recorder. We
make a tape of this because John Kotter is sitting on
pins and needles waiting for me to replay that tape
on what Oleg tells me, you know? Oleg doubletalks
but we get a message that we want to meet, you know?
So they had some kind of a security council and we

. made a date and it was postponed. Oleg called up
and apologized which I also have on tape. And each

time the Bureau was very happy. We're gonna start a-
blossoming relationship here, you know, and end up
with photographs and better something, which I don't
think I would have gone all the way. But that's what
their idea was so they can exchange at a later date.

Blackmail?

into
Blackmail him / giving them information (unintelligible).

Say like they get one of our, one of our pilots, right?
And if we don't get our pilot back they expose Oleg,

' vight? Or make him.

Be a double agent. Blackmail him...
Be a double...

into being a double agent.

Right. .

That's the idea.

And I'm in the middle. So, anyway, I go, I go to the
mission with my daughter, who was at the time 12 years
old. My daughter, I guess, is a little use to my
life. She's use to FBI all her life. She knows not
to talk. She knows whether we look at her when to
say something. I guess she's the closest thing to me
now. She goes along. She's very cool and we both
walked into the mission on the pretense that she had
to do a project for school on the Soviet Union. She
needed material. Now as soon as we walked into the

. mission everybody there I know because they reside in |

the building. And they all say, "Ilonka Marischa
blah, blah, blah, blah." And I'm very friendly with
them all. They all love my daughter. But we're.
there for other reasons. We're there to go to see
Oleg. We gather, we gather the material, meanwhile
I'm aware that every picture has an eye or every
poster has a mirror or camera, you know? But my
daugher's very cool and we're left alone in the room
where the Soviet material is displayed. But I know
we're being watched. She knows it too and she
doesn't, she says, "Mommy, look, this is beautiful,
beautiful." You know? Then I ask for Oleg to this
very, very tough Soviet woman that said "What you

- want?", you know. . I said "Oleg Likichev, please.

I'd like to speak to him." And she called and he
is still in the United Nations, he asks you to wait.
I refused a wire or anything like that, but...

What wire are you talking about?

A wire on me.

Oh.

Because...

That the agents (unintelligible)

Yes, because Oleg I know likes me and if he sees me
he would grab me and hug me and that's the Russian
way... >

Yeah. ~
And he'll feel that and I'm dead.

Right.

Right in the mission. That's not my. proper there.

Right.

And I wouldn't risk it with my daughter. So, anyway,
we waited. We were allowed the run-of the place. We
knew everyone there and...

Like you say, eyes were watching you.

Oh definitely, definitely, because that's how they
test you when you walk in there. And you just don't
get in there and have the run of the place, you're
not left alone. But I know you're being watched.

Sure.

Anyway, there was this, it was, it was a legitimate
excuse that Oleg was tied up in the United Nations
because it was in the paper the next day, that it
was some security council meeting. And I said
"Please give this note to Mr. Likichev. Tell him
thank you very much for the material. And best
wishes to his wife, blah, blah, blah," and we left.
Funny thing is the cop outside almost arrested us,
a uniformed police officer.

For what reason?

He gave us a dirty look and made a very slurring,
nasty remark when I left. But I hate to knock the
police department because they're helping me now.
But, I guess, he didn't know, you know?

Yeah, he thought you were Russians. |

He thought I was a Russian.

Or a Russian sympathizer.

Right, especially going in with a child and I looked’
very... : .

Yeah.

American. Anyway, I got home and John Kotter was
waiting in front of my door. I remember it was
raining. He was reading. And'I said, he said "Are
you going to meet Oleg?" I said, "Now how the hell
can I make a date with Oleg with my daughter?"

Yeah.

HY 50955 DoclId: 32423630 Page 227 -
~46-

ML: I said Oleg's in the United Nations. Why don't you
tell me these things before that they're delayed at
a security council meeting, you know, instead of me
letting, letting me sit there. You know these are
all the little things that use to annoy me...

FS: Yeah.

ML: that they have to screen things first before, you
know - check things out, don't have to make a blunder
like that. Anyway, I said I left Oleg a note. I
said now you go home and I'm going to take it easy
and they, we tried, and I said, "You know, John,
you're just going to get me so involved with Oleg.
I'm not going to end up in bed in a motel room
upstate somewhere with Oleg so you can come in and
take photographs. That's not my stick." I said
I'll gather garbage, get license plates, tape, do
everything else, but, I'll even take the mail, like
I've been doing, but I'm not going to be caught in
bed. I said that's too big a pawn for me and I'm
not getting anything for it right now. They allowed
me to take mail, steam it, photograph it and put it
back. Some of that mail is now missing, which
belongs to the Soviet people, which this perpetrator,
perpetrator has and wants to blackmail me with and I
asked the FBI to please help me with that.

‘FS: Who's the perpetrator?

ML: The perpetrator is Guiseppi Faisiano, aka Pionne,

- aka David Ring, who broke into my apartment and stole”
this tape with Oleg Likichev, these love conversations,
the mail, and part of the Albanian code. He has those
in his possession. He threatens my life with ir. He
threatens blackmail with me. He assaulted me. He
pistol-whipped me and I asked the Bureau for help.

FS: Did he try to throw you out the 18 story build-, window? |
ML: Yes.
FS: He did what?
ML: ' Yes, he tried to push me out the window.
‘\ FS: 18 stories?
ML: — Yes, and I told him stay away, get back, because if

anything happens to me there's letters with the
Justice Department naming everything I know about you,

and he stopped cold. He threatened to shoot my

-daughter in the back. He's threatening her right

now with disgrace because she is the daughter of
the, of a well-known man. Right now my main concern
is the, these letters and the. code and the tape and
possibly other things, are in the hands of this
Guiseppi Faisiano, and he wants money from me and
he's probably right now at the building. He is
casing the Soviets and he's going to try to go to
the same people that he has on the letters to tell
them that I was an informant for the FBI for revenge,
for having him arrested on the assault charge with a
gun. He also wants money. He wants to disgrace the
FBL. He's blackmailing right now my husband, my ex-

“husband, for the master keys of the Newberry. My

husband is calling me for help and I don't know what
to do. I asked Frank to help me. I gave him the
code because everybody refused. I was afraid to have
any-, anywhere. I guess Frank helped me before in
Cuba and I don't, I worked, he worked for me and f
worked for him and I don't know where to go because,
the only ones that are helping me now are the local
police - in their lunch hours or when I'm too afraid
to leave the house they buy me milk and fruit for the
kids. And they'll take the children home when I get
a threat on the phone or a box in the mailbox or get
my back door shot at. I take my children and I put
them in the 23rd precinct.

They even, off duty...

The off-duty police, police officers take my children
home.... ; :

-And they spend time at the house?

And they spend time at the house in their free time
when they should be home with their families:

Well you have saved the life of two people, right?

FS: And you saved their lives because a contract was

FS: And even though you have saved their lives..
ML: . I asked them please help me with this man, he has

Soviet documents, he's hurt me, he's hurt my

children, he almost shot my daughter. He, I asked
them please help me because I gave you information

for nothing and they said they promised to do something
on this individual immigration-wise. So far he has
threatened everybody around me. My physicians, my
mother, my ex-husband, my children, my neighbors, my

super.

FS: He's an illegal immigrant?

ML: - He is. I would say he's an illegal alien.

FS: What's his full name, his-real name?

ML: . His arrest name, that he was arrested under was

Guiseppi Faisaino. He has, he's also known as David
Ring. He has a passport under this name. He's also
known as Pinno, and he is a gunman. Never worked a
day in his life, never paid taxes, he's a gambler,
he's a stick-up man and I worked for the FBI on
organized crime at the racetrack. Roosevelt. Raceway,
Yonkers, and...

Now you've turned, you want me to turn this tape
over to Senator Baker's committee to be turned over
to the Justice Department, is that correct? Right?

Yes.
You want me turn the...

Yes, I would like you, Frank, to turn this over just
in case something happens to me because I don't know
which way it's going to come. .

And you need some protection, right now, right?

I need some type of help for my children, because of
this man Pinno threatening to expose my dealings with
the FBI and to the foreign press. I just caught up
in this thing since 1959 and I've been with it up
until last month, last week and I've just, and I need
help. There is no help. I mean since last month and
I don't want my children hurt. They've already been
hurt.

Alright, T promise to turn this tape and the code, over

to Senator Baker’ s committee, right?
Yes.

Who in turn will turn the information over to the-
proper officials in Washington, D. C.

Yes. I don't mean to embarass the Bureau. I know how
important it is but at this point I need help
desparately for my kids. They're 6 and 14 and they
don't deserve what they have to go through. The

Marita Lorenze

You an. American citizen?
Yes.

Were you born here?

Born in Braemen, Germany on August 18, 1939 and my
mother registered me at birthwith the Consulate

_ because she was. stuck in the war over there, but I
-am an American citizen, not naturalized or anything.

I was registered as an American citizen.

How old were you when you came to the United States?
I.was about 12, came over on the U.S.S. Henry Gibbons,
American troop transport, because my mother worked for
the United States Army.

Okay, now we're going to go ahead and jump. You went
to Cuba what month and what year and on what ship?

I met, I went, I took several trips with my father
who was Commander of the oceanliner Berlin. I met
Fidel...

What was your father's full name?

Commander Heinrich Frederick Lorenz.

‘And how old was he?

Approximately 50-something, 55, when I first, I went
on several trips to Cuba before I met Fidel with,
but I was a little girl.

When's the first time you went to Cuba after Fidel
took over the government on January 1, 1959?

I met Fidel February 28, 1959, on one of my father's
cruises where Fidel came aboard with several of his
men. He said he saw the oceanliner from the Havana
Hilton balcony and he took a launch with his Chief
of the Navy, what's his name, I forgot, Castagna...

Forget it, forget about it, we can go ahead. Who
else was there besides the chief of the Cuban navy.

Selia Sanchez, Haiti Santa Maria, Paco

Okay now, what happened

Castanyava...

Castanyava

Castanyava was the chief of the Navy.

And Fidel offered you a job or something, can you
go into that?

Well he was very fond of everything German. He
said he read and my father, you know, tried.
to pacify the tourists, the passengers on the.ship
because they were terrified. They thought they were
being invaded. So I helped my father pacify the
tourists and it was really a funny scene. Then I
steered Fidel to my father's cabin and we went to
dinner and Fidel started to play kneesies under the

table. And this was February 28, 1959 on the cruise.

And he offered you a job, right?

Yes, after. about 5 hours. on board ship we went back
up to my father's cabin and had drinks and exchanged
gifts; and my father and Fidel seemed to get along
very well. My father is diplomatic and they

.exchanged plaques and my father's silver ashtray and
‘stuff like that. And he asked me, he asked my father

if since I was bilingual if I could go, come back,
return to Cuba to be his secretary since he was
getting German mail and he did not speak German and
he assured me that I would be safe and set up in an
office, and blah, blah, blah, blah. . And I had
friends in Cuba anyway.

How old. were you then?

Nineteen, nineteen years old.

Did you get off the ship and stay there?

No, I went back to New York. Fidel, on the bridge,
asked me for my phone number and address in New York

and said he would call me, and I just, I didn’ t
believe it.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 235
FS: When did he call you?

ML: The same day I arrived in New York. Because my
: father took off that night for Germany again and
the phone ring, and it rang at lo "clock in the
morning. I guess. the previous.

FS: Well- he went back to Germany with the ship, right?
‘Where did you go?

ML: I was living with my brother in New York City.
: My brother was a translator for the United Nations
and I was alone living in New York City going to
the Merchantson Banker School.

FS: Well how did you get back to New York City from
Havana?

ML: On my father's ship. It was the last stop on the
cruise of about 5 or 6 stops.

FS: Oh, in other words the, in other words the ship left
that night, left Havana that night...

ML: Yeah.

FS: went over to New York and then from New York went

back to Europe, right?

ML: . Yes, Yes. I thought about Fidel and he pointed out
this is my Havana and I guess I was impressed. I
was young, I don't know. And I thought that...

FS: He called, .he called you, he knew just about what
: time you were going to arrive in New York and when
you got there he called you, what, the same, the same
day you got there?

ML: The same day our ship arrived, three days later. And I
just picked up the phone and the Havana operator said
one moment please, the Prime Minister is on the phone,
on the line, and I heard some shouting and then I
heard "hello". : ,

FS: ' Did he speak Cuban or English to you?

ML: He spoke. broken English in his hoarse voice. I guess
he was giving a lot of speeches at that time. And he
asked me, "Hello Marita, you think I don't call? I
think about you very much and I call. I keep my word.
‘T want to prove to you that one man's Cuban word I keep.'

So, I was as surprised, I was very surprised.

How long was it did you leave New York to go to
Havana?

Fidel said to me, I said is this really you Fidel,
and he said yes. I am in Havana Hilton, you call

me back in room 2408, and I said no, alright I
believe you I said because how else would you have
my number. He said "I want you come back. I think
about you and I will send a plane, my plane, and you
come back." And it was a joke really, I liked the
Cocoa Glace, it's an ice cream in a cocoanut shell,
and he had sent to my father's ship.a case of it so
I would have enough for the return trip home because,
I don't know, I just talked about Havana, the island
in general. So I, and I still didn't believe him
that he would send the plane.

Did he send the airplane?

Yes.

What kind of an airplane did he send?

A Cubana airliner with...

Four engines?

Yes, with two men and two men came to the, my door.
I was living at 344 West 87th Street at the time, on
the second floor, and my brother was at a UN party

and I was home alone studying. Oh no, in fact I was-
reading a Herbert L. Mathews article on Fidel Castro

. and Cuba when the doorbell rang, and it was Jesus

and Pedro ;
and they. showed me identification: One came in military
uniform, the other in civilian clothes. One smiled,
one.didn't. One said, “Are you ready?" And one said,
"We go now. Fidel want very. much to see you."

(Laughter) .

And I said I didn't finish my homework yet. I was like
in shock. I didn't know what to do. So they said they
were staying in a hotel, that they would, the plane
would leave tomorrow, please be ready. I, meanwhile I
haven't even unpacked, you know, from the cruise. My

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page’ 237
ML: clothes were all laundered anyway from the ship and
(contd.)* I hadn't even unpacked because I was worred about
missing two days at school.

FS: Yeah.
ML: So I went...
FS: Well these are incidentals anyway, so, what'd you

do, you went to the airport? What airport did the
airplane, was the airplane at?

ML: Uh, LaGuard, which is not Kennedy, it was at that
time named. something else. Idlewild, right?

FS: Idlewild, yeah.

ML: “And...

FS: It was Idlewild airport, that’: s where they had the
airplane, Cubana Airlines?

ML: Yeah, Cubana Airlines. Got on the plane...

FS: How many people where on. the airplane? |

ML: Me, a steward, a.pilot and a co-pilot and the two
guards.

FS: Ha, ha, had -- that's funny. Go ahead.

Now when ,you went back to Havana you ‘saw Fidel where?
Cause we'll go over this lightly.

Iwas in the... |

At the Hilton?

I was driven by black limousine right to the Hilton.
And that's where Fidel was staying at the Hilton, right?

Yes, he was having an argument in his suite with Chez
Raoul and some Americans.

He was having some argument with some Americans. Do
you know who the Americans were?

Yes.

Who were they?

One lady. attorney trying to promote something, Muriel...
Oh this was more business or something like that?

Yes business. Everybody was trying to promote this
and that with Fidel.

Yes, well that's immaterial.

So then I was told to go in the room and wait and the
door locked. And I was in there, in his suite, and
Fidel came in and I missed him and he missed me and

the rest is going to be in the book if I ever write it.
You'll write it don't worry. ‘ Alright now...

If I live.

Do you know approximately when you met me?

right after that.

In April, right. And this is where we made contact

and. so forth and then we saw each other a few times |
after that.

In the coffee shop.

In the coffee shop and this is when you were recruited
to go ahead and spy for the United States and so forth
and, were you ever introduced or, to Colonel Nickels?
Yes.

Do you know who Colonel Nickels is, right. He was

the Colonel who was military attache with the American
Embassy. in Havana, Cuba at that time, right?

‘Yes.

Okay. Then you started your spy thing and so forth
and so forth, alright? .

Um Hum.

We'll go ahead and jump a ‘Little bit and so forth.
There were several meetings that Fidel had in the
Hilton with some of the people of the staff. I was
present at the meeting, right?

Right.

And, one of the time that Fidel was talking to the
staff concerned the gambling casinos and American
business interests in Cuba, right?

Out of Cuba.

Cuba. All the American businesses were going to go
ahead and be nationalized because it was Cuba and the
Cuba for the Cubans.

Right.

And so forth. And then it was suggested about well
you know the American government may not like it.
You're gonna have all the American business interests
put pressure’ on the State Department which would put .
pressure on him and that they would be up in arms and
they would have the agents, they would send new agents
into Cuba because the CIA at that time was very close,
closely contacted, at least certain people in the CIA
had contact with the 26th of July movement. As a
matter of fact that they were exchanging information .
with Castro...

Uh hum.

which enabled him to outwit many of the other groups
so really CIA helped Fidel quite a bit in this power
struggle that was going on in Cuba at that time. So
Fidel, with the help of CIA...

. Yes.

got to be the ruler of Cuba. Now...

I would, what about, where did Fidel get most of his
guns from? —

Well, you know...
To lead the revolution?

Right, you know, so forth. That's a story which we
won't have to go into and so forth because we just
(unintelligible) briefly over it. And then there
came a period of time.where Fidel in all his
popularity and so forth was, now Fidel with you - he

made approaches to you, right, and so forth?

Mm-Hmm.

You know, and you liked him and you actually in
liking him like a young girl thought for the future
that here's a man that I, you admired, that you
started to get an affection for him and so forth,
and really you thought of marriage, right?

Mm-hmm.

And in the process of being close with him, being as
the man's intelligent, dynamic and so forth, he did
force his attentions on you and naturally he seduced
you. You didn't want to but it happened.

Yes.

And you had nobody to go to because, hey, you're in”
his Cuba, right? . :

I was in his Cuba alright.

Right, now also what we were getting in this Senate
Intelligence Committee has got is the things that

Fidel has stated against the United States government
if they tried to interfere with the revolution and so
forth when the new election time comes because at that
time the President of the United States was Eisenhower
and it looked like that the Democrats were going to
win the election and he felt that if a new government,
which was discussed among the top military people, if
the new government came in and if they decided that they
didn't like Fidel's policy, which Fidel was saying what
he was going to do for Cuba on an international scale,
that if the United States government decided to go and
turn against him and put pressure on him he would do
likewise to the United States government. “And he was
going to export his revolution in Latin America. These
are the things that you heard...

powerful people yet they have done nothing with the
problem that you. have had right now with you, three
times there's been an attempt on your life, isn't

an 18 story building. Another time you got pistol-
whipped. You did all this crap for these people
here yet they will do nothing to go ahead at the

you or your children any protection. This piece of
tape is going to go right to Senator Baker's office,
it'll go to Howard Liebengood for him to listen to,
to evaluate it and turn this tape over to the proper
authorities which will be the Justice Department.
You can call Howard Liebengood. to see if he has
received those codes from the Albanian Embassy from
me. You can call him and find out, and also you

The Soviets are very trained, they would leave a
cigarette on an ashtray. If you knocked it over they
know immediately someone was in. the apartment.

Now, when the agents, before your husband opened the
door with the pass key, did the agents look the door

- over to see if there was any powder marks, tapes,

hairs, or anything, or something leaning against the
door to signify that possibly when the Cuban general,
this, not Cuban general, this Russian general, who is
a top KGB agent... oo

Yes.

wanted to see if somebody made an entry they would
leave something on the door.

Yes.

They inspected the door, right? And they didn’t find

anything?
Right.

Right. So they opened the door. In other words, what-
ever they touched...

But they made a mistake inside on one break-in and
that:

Alright, now, no let's not jump. We're, you were on
this one particular thing. a

Alright.

These people did go in, they did what they had to do.

hidden....

cameras that they installed some place in there, right?
No, it was microfilm.

Well there were cameras...

FS: You don't know for sure, though?
ML: I'm not sure, my husband...
Fs: ‘No, but you do know about the cameras?
ML: Yes.
FS: Alright, but there is a possibility they brought

bugging devices because it's logical they would
bring bugging devices. .

ML: I think sometimes, plenty of times they wanted to
plant a bug.

FS: Sure.

ML: Especially in the television, the cable TV, the...

FS: _ Well they install that through the walls and so forth.

; for the cable TV.

FS: Oh, for the cable TV. Well, yeah, alright.

ML: ' That way they thought they could tune in to them
transmitting.

FS: Yeah. Alright, now, how long did they stay in, to
the General's apartment?

ML: In the apartment, approximately 10-15-20 minutes.

FS: Then they left, your husband closed the door, did he
wipe his fingerprints off the door? Do you know?

ML: No, but my husband would usually put the edge of the
rug back the way he found it.

FS: Right, in other, everything...

“ML: It was turned over...

Mm-hmm.

your husband was on edge about the way the agents
were...

Oh yeah.

Okay? Alright, so we'll forget that part. Now how
about other entries. We'll get one at a time.

The other entry that's outstanding is Soviet..

Yeah, go ahead, keep talking.

Very Americanized Soviet, handsome, married with a 10

year old daughter. I forget his name. I have them
all at home. . And, I nicknamed him "The Tennis Player"
because he use to do a lot of jogging and play tennis
every morning to make contacts with Americans, and try
to recruit, I guess, gather information at the same
time.. He spoke English without an...

(unintelligible)

Fluently, without an accent, down to curses and slang
and everything else. His wife... ;

You got friendly with him also?

No, he even suggested to take my husband to a massage
parlor and he was way out, too much way out.

In other words, play with girls?
I had his, no, I was, well he was one of those.
He liked to play?

Yeah.

detective. I was working up there and the detectives
were hot. on a homicide and I answered the phone and
here it was the tennis player calling to make a formal
complaint of breaking and entering his apartment. I
had him on the phone.

And he didn't know it was you.

And I died, I tried to disguise. my voice and he kept
on talking and talking and talking and I couldn't
disguise my voice. I was afraid he would know that I,

working for this police department in this precinct.

What was your job with them?

Auxiliary volunteer. Photos, translations, rape
cases, interrogation.

And at that time you were answering phone calls that
were coming in?

And typing, and doing other things but I don't really
want to get those guys involved because they...

No, I just wanted, wanted them to know what you were
doing in the police department.

I was an auxiliary sergeant.

Answering the phones. Okay.

Auxiliary is a volunteer police.

Right, good enough. Now what other entries did you make
with them. That's two -- that you specified. .

I was a little afraid so my...

Things were getting a little hot for you.

Yes, because we had too many Russians, we had the

All living in the same building. There was, it was
comical. The Albanians wouldn't talk to the Russians,
the Russians ignored the Albanians, the Red Chinese
went down the service entrance and to avoid the
Russians. and the Al-, it was just,the Secret Service

FS: In other words,
ML: We had, in one day about four different agencies
watching people.
FS: In and out of the building.
ML: And we didn't know if we were coming or going.
FS: Yeah.
ML: We lived on the second floor. We had a view of the

see the cars pull up and the cars leave. ;

just didn't want to get caught because it was a heck

FS; Well, booze can loosen a lot of people's mouths.

ML: Well it was mostly their vodka anyway they gave us.

But, yeah.they suggested the, using agents as waiters
and bartenders and all that. And I said that wouldn't
go. Soviet people are very trained. They smell any-
thing like that. And I was very open with them. They'd
leave from the countries and I would be the first to
know. They would bring back. gifts. They babysat my

How about the Albanians now, tell me about the code.
The Albanians, the Albanians we got very friendly with

a Mr. Koyani, Ambassador to the Mission, the U.N., and
the Albanians are not as elite as the Russians are.

‘The Russians dry clean their own clothes, burn their

own garbage, have no photos, personal things in the
apartment. The Albanians are more, they allow their
children to watch television. The Soviets don't. We
convinced the Albanians who had a mission on their
mission, which they blocked a complete fire exit was
on the 2lst floor of the Newberry. They lived in the
apartments on the 20th floor and the 22nd floor. And

HY 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 268
FS:

FS:

FS:

-36-

they had about 30, 30 families who-resided there and
their mission was there. And we became very friendly
with them because of one incident, especially my

husband, took, went to see his mother and left me in

‘charge of the building. That'same day they had a so-

called demonstration where the demonstrators had a
25-minute picketing right to picket. .The demonstra-
tion turned into a bloody riot where they burned flags
and everything and the Albanians came down. They all
are armed. They're all armed, and they agitated the
rioters out on the street. And I was alone with only
my basic police training and my wits, really, and a
panicking doorman and my kids. I was just alone. I,
the first thing I looked out the window when I heard
the shooting I called the Bureau and I said, "Get me
Al Chestone fast.'' I said I don't have Louis here.
I said I need help. I have a demonstration. I don't
know what to do. And there were about 500 people
throwing bricks, bottles, everything through the plate
glass windows. Burning American flags and Albanian
flags because of something that happened in Albania.
Those that defected here. started this demonstration.
So. then I, things got out of hand, the doorman was
hurt with a brick. I saw blood, and the Albanian
Ambassador and five. top officials agitated these
people from inside the lobby with fists. Very
unprofessional-like. :

Yeah.

So I physically pulled them by their coats and told
them, "Get upstairs, get upstairs and get yourself
back into the mission", because tenants were walking
through the lobby and we were going to get hurt by .
flying glass and everything else. And I had no help.
The police were outside of the line... :

Marita, what we're going into details is something

that is a story.

Oh, alright.
So we'll go ahead and just bypass that.

Anyway, the Albanians Al was interested into, and
especially because they were admitting the Red Chinese
into the United Nations, which they did. It was that
speech, which I have the original copy of. Ambassador
Rocco Nocco - sounds crazy, but that's his name, Rocco

Nocco, and they were, they were sloppier, and the
agent Al Chestone told me convince them, you know,
case ‘em, keep going up and down the steps, what
time they throw their garbage out. Garbage was
the most valuable source of information for the
Bureau, and that was...

Garbage and trash.

Trash. Chicken bones, codes, diapers, whatever, you
know, and that was my job because I had the patience.
Now the FBI supplied me with bandaids and gloves,
flashlights, batteries and the whole thing, because

I convinced the Albanians that the compacter, which
was the disposal system in the building from 31 floors
down -- in other words when they threw their garbage
out that it would come out in brick form, block form,
brick crushed, which in fact was not true.

But: they believed it?-

They believed it. They trusted us. Louis and I were
the only ones allowed in the mission. We were the
only ones.

Now this mission is that building you were talking
about.

That's still there.

(Still there.

Very much there. That's the code that you have.
Right.

So, I started, made it a every two hour routine to go

. after midnight when they put their garbage out in the

hall, pick up the bags. Take them down to the service
entrance and take the bags at home, take ‘em home.

And go through the orange peels and chicken bones and
gather torn up letters, this was before they got smart
and bought a shredder (unintelligible). And I would
turn this garbage letter, in other words, I would

past it together and give it to the Bureau and some

of these letters turned out to be very valuable. Among
them was one code, now...

BW 50955 Bocld:32423630 Page 270
FS:

I would assume that these letters that were in code
they would be classified material. Otherwise it
wouldn't be in. code.

Very valuable, yes. The...
And this was turned over to who?

To Al Chestone. The first code I got, I just got on
a hunch lucky. Because it was just at. the time when
the Red Chinese entered the United States, first
came here. Mr. Huang Yua, and I met them. We met
them first before anybody met them, Louis and I.

And that same night the code came down at 3:00 in ‘the
morning and I just had a hunch and I got up and I
said, "Louis I can't sleep, I'm going down and do
some work. Give me the keys to the compacter room."
So I went downstairs and I waited and sure enough
around 3:30 these bags started to come down from the
21st floor.

3:30 in the morning?

3:30 in the morning because Al said watch them
closely, because of the Red Chinese. And I shut
the machine off and I got these, I got this code,
I caught it in other words, but it...

This is the code you turned over to me?

This is the first code, the very first code, at the
risk of having my hands chopped off because if I
didn't shut that machine off in time I could have
been hurt. But I got it. The first code was very

valuable. It was sent to Washington.

(End of tape - side 2).

..,these bags of stuff and if you hadn't have turned
off the machine you would have got your hand either
chopped up or cut off, and so forth. What did, were
you saying about Al, Uncle Al?

Uncle Al slept and I did the work, and by the time I
got upstairs and took the orange peels and everything
out of the garbage and separated the letters and ©

every tiny little piece with tweezers and everything,

HY 50955 DoclId: 32423630 Page 271

put it all in a box, right down to every piece. I
ruined my rugs and everything. And Uncle Al would
come at 8:30, 9:00 in the morning and I would still
be up separating the garbage and he'd be.all fresh
and ready for work and I had just come back from the
garbage room. And.

You stayed awake all night?

Yeah, with the tweezers and I use. to run out of
skotch tape which was frustrating cause I couldn't
stick these letters togethers without skotch tape,

so he brought me a big box of skotch tape which

was very kind of him. Then I would give it to him
and he'd, he'd have coffee, tea and toast or whatever.

And I'd say, "Now I want to go to sleep."' And he'd

say, "No, no, no, wait a minute. Mr. So-and-so,
or Berzofsky, we want to get a line on Mr. Berzofsky.

Who was Mr. Berzofsky?-

Berzofsky, the Second Secretary to the Union of the
Soviet Socialist Republic.

What was his first name, do you know?
Mmmm, I forgot...
That's alright, it don't matter.

I forgot really. But we were very close to him. His
wife was a surgeon in the Soviet mission and she was,
she's, she's adorable. She's nice, she's sweet and

she has a lovely daughter, Irene, who turned out to

have liver cancer. She was a little girl when I first -
met her,. like my daughter. My.daugher played with her,
they took piano lessons together, exchanged books, and

‘the little girl; at sixteen, Irene was sent back to

the Soviet Union with liver cancer. I got very close
to the mother, the mother was heartbroken, the father

-was heartbroken. I guess like any mother. and father

when their only child turns out to have liver cancer.
She's diagnosed as such in the Soviet Union and they
asked me to get medicine, pain killers for Irene. I
do so and pass along to them empirin and codine #4,
which is a pain killer which they smuggled over to

their daughter on with the permission of
the FBI. We exchanged jewelry, clothes, and everything
else. We were just one mother to another mother.

Their little girl in trouble, mine not in trouble and
it was little things like that that I would get very
involved with. I don't know...

Morita let me ask you this here,. did the agents ever
tell you to go out with any of the diplomats in the
mission?

Well, now.we have to go back to Oleg, Oleg Likichev.
And who is he again?

He was the KGB spy that they lost and. thought he, they
thought he was still residing in Washington, the out-
side of Washington, D. C., in Virginia. He was
supposed to have last been seen in Virginia somewhere
and all of a sudden they picked him up in our building,
as being in our building. They.lost him and they were ©
furious, the Bureau, and they wanted us very close to
him. And he, we had: alot of evenings together we
spent with him, dinners, and he came to us,

In other words he asked you to go out, did he ask
(unintelligible)

Well, Oleg, Oleg, let's just say, I don't know if it
was a game. they were playing or if they were doubles
or what. They talked a.lot about the State of
Washington, residing in the State of Washington.
They also. knew I had diamonds and he asked me,

(unintelligible) "Can you get me diamonds?"

What did he call you?
Ilonka Marischa, Ilona Marita.
Oh, that's in Russian?

Yes. And we always exchanged Russian words and I
know a few, enough to get by on. All of a sudden,

‘you know, he was interested in diamonds. He had a

fascination for diamonds. His wife, she was kind
of sweet on my husband he was kind of sweet on me
and I kept telling Uncle Al this thing is going to
get out of hand. I said all of a sudden he wants

Page 273
~41-

diamonds, and Al, what do I do. Go ahead, talk to
him about diamonds. So I said Oleg, what do you
mean by diamonds? He said uncut stones for cash.

I am a Soviet official, I cannot go into a jewelry
store like you and buy them. -I want diamonds. I'm
willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars for them.

I said, I said tell me why, Oleg. And he said,
"Money, why does anybody want diamonds." I said it's
a good enough reason. So I said, "Hey, Louis, what
can we do for Oleg about his diamonds?"' And Louis
said we'll figure something out. And then Oleg said,
this was at a dinner party up in their house. Hot
diamonds, he wanted hot, uncut, raw diamonds. So

he was serious, he was dead serious. He said he
would buy them for cash.

FS: How serious was he? Did you ever get any for him?

ML: Well it got this far. We told Uncle Al the next
morning. I said, "Uncle Al, I got a surprise for
you. You're gonna have to come up with some hot
diamonds. A hundred. thousand dollars worth because
I promised Oleg that I would get them for him since
he can't buy them. Oleg wants diamonds.” And I
said if you can put two and two together maybe this
guy will defect because he's talking. about the State
of Washington. I said but you have to be careful,
I have to be careful, no? So Al said I'll get you
the diamonds. You tell him to get the cash ready.
So Uncle Al went to an underworld source and got
the diamonds. Uncle. Al made a boo-boo and Oleg, the
day of the exchange I was supposed to make the sale
in the.apartment, Oleg was at a sports meeting in
Washington,D.C. Uncle Al said, "I've got to give
these diamonds back to the underworld.or give them
the cash.” I said, "Listen, I told you tomorrow,
not today, Al. Tomorrow, because Oleg told us he's
going to this soccer meeting in Washington, D.C. _
Alright whatever the kind of meeting it is. He is
in Washington, D. C." "Oh is he?" I said, "Yes,
he is." Right. Anyway, Uncle Al started to panick
because he was in my house with a hundred thousand
dollars worth of uncut, hot diamonds. .

FS: By himself?

ML: By himself, and I was supposed to. get the cash from
’ Oleg. Oleg said on a Thursday and Uncle Al came on

HW 50955 Docld:324273630 Page 274
~42-

a Wednesday and the whole thing...
FS: So what happened?

ML: fell through. Al said he had to give them back to
the underworlds, to his source. So he took them
back and then Oleg, you know, I had to talk ny ;
way out of it. It was just one of the flubs. But
anyway after I left my husband Oleg kept asking for
me, kept coming directly to the apartment and say-
ing, "Louis, I don't believe you two split, you two
go, she left.. I don't believe it." And my. husband
said "yes,.she did leave. It's her own problems,
Oleg, you know, forget about it." And he said,
"No, it's not possible. You must stay together.
You must stay. together." Anyway, he kept coming,
about four times and asking my husband, until. my
husband. made a joke of it and said Oleg wants to
see you. I mean he's made it damn plain that he
wants to see you. In other words if you're
finished I'll take over. Where is she living? My
husband tells him I'm living on 88th Street. Now
I talked to my husband and I said what did you do
that for? Tell him I'm living on.88th Street?

You know, because I know he wants to go out with
me. You can feel it, I can feel it, the, you know?
So I call up,Uncle Al meantime is transferred to
Newark, I get another case agent. Louis gets a
case agent for the building and he works alone,
without me. The other agent is John Kotter.

FS: With the FBI?

ML: FBI, 69th Street. I call up John Kotter. I said,

"John,..I hear your taking Al's place", and I meet
him. Drop things, start things, drop things,
different assignments, then we get to Oleg. I said
look, Oleg is bothering Louis. He wants to go out
with me. And John Kotter says, "Beautiful, that is
a beautiful setup. Let's call him up." I said,
-"Hey,-wait.a minute. Either do this sophisticated,
alright? . First I'll send him a Christmas card and
sign it Ilonka Marischa, you know? I'll put my
phone number on the bottom, something you know?
Or I'1l happen to be |there when he's going into the
building, or I'll bump into him." TI said you don't
just call him.up. You know that's going to be like
a setup because I've/been avoiding him. So, anyway,
he tells, he outlines the whole thing.. I said what
have you got planned, John. And he says, "Do you

And I'm in the middle. So, anyway; I go, I go to the
mission with my daughter, who was at the time 12 years
old. My daughter, I guess, is a little use to my
life. She's use to FBI all her life. She knows not
to talk. She knows whether we look at her when to
say something. I guess she's the closest thing to me
now. She goes along. She's very cool and we both
walked into the mission on the pretense that she had
to do a project for school on the Soviet Union. She
needed material. Now as soon as we walked into‘the
mission everybody there I know because they reside in
the building. . And they all say, 'Ilonka Marischa
blah, blah, blah, blah." And I'm very friendly with
them all. They all love my daughter. But we're
there for other reasons. We're there to go to see
Oleg. We gather, we gather the material, meanwhile
I'm aware that every picture has an eye or every
poster has a mirror or camera, you know? But my
daugher's very cool and we're left alone in the room
where the Soviet material is displayed. But I know
we're being watched. She knows it too and she
doesn't, she says, "Mommy, look, this is beautiful,
beautiful." You know? Then I ask for Oleg to this
very, very tough Soviet woman that said "What you
want?", you know. I said "Oleg Likichev, please.

I'd like to speak to him." And she called and he

is still in the United Nations, he asks you to wait.
I refused a wire or anything like that, but...

What wire are you talking about?
A wire on me.

oh. .

Because...

That the agents (unintelligible)

Yes, because Oleg I know likes me and if he sees me
he would grab me and hug me and that's the Russian

way...

Yeah.

And he'll feel that and I'm dead.
Right.
Right in the mission. That's not my proper there.

Right.

And I wouldn't risk it with my daughter. So, anyway,
we waited. We were allowed the run of the place. We
knew everyone there and... :

Like you say, eyes were watching you.

Oh definitely, definitely, because that's how they
test you when you walk in there. And you just don't
get in there and have the run of the place, you're
not left alone. But I know you're being watched.

Sure.

Anyway, there was this, it was, it was a legitimate
excuse that Oleg was tied up in the United Nations
because it was in the paper the next day, that it
was some security council meeting. And I said
"Please give this note to Mr. Likichev. Tell him
thank you. very much for the material. And best
wishes to his wife, blah, blah, blah," and we left.
Funny thing is the cop outside almost arrested us,
a uniformed police officer.

For what reason? -

He gave us a dirty look and made a very slurring,
nasty remark when I left. But I hate to knock the
police department because they're helping me now.
But, I guess, he didn't know, you know?

Yeah, he thought you were. Russians.

He thought I was a Russian.

Or a Russian sympathizer.

Right, especially going in with a child and I looked
very...

Yeah.

American. Anyway,.I got home and John Kotter was
waiting in front of my door. I remember it was
raining. He was reading. And I said, he said "Are
you going to meet Oleg?" I said, "Now how the hell
can I make a date with Oleg with my daughter?”

Yeah.

ML: I said Oleg's in the United Nations. Why don't you
tell me these things before that they're delayed at
a security council meeting, you know, instead of me
letting, letting me sit there. You know these are
all the little things that use to annoy me...

FS: Yeah.

ML: _ that they have to screen things first before, you
know - check things out, don't have to make a blunder
like that. Anyway, I said I left Oleg a note. I
said now you go home and I'm going to take it easy
and they, we tried, and I said, "You know, John,
you're just going to get me so involved with Oleg.
I'm not going to end up in bed in a motel room
upstate somewhere with Oleg so you can come in and
take photographs. That's not my stick." I said
I'll gather garbage, get license plates, tape, do
everything else, but, I'll even take the mail, like
I've been doing, but I'm not going to be caught in
bed. I said that's too big a pawn for me and I'm
not getting anything for it right now. They allowed
me to take mail, steam it, photograph it and put it
back. Some of that mail is now missing, which
belongs to the Soviet people, which this perpetrator,
perpetrator has and wants to blackmail me with and I
asked the FBI to please help me with that.

FS: ' Who's the perpetrator?

ML: The perpetrator is Guiseppi Faisiano, aka Pionne,
aka David Ring, who broke into my apartment and stole
this tape with Oleg Likichev, these love conversations,
the mail, and part of the Albanian code. He has those
in his possession. He threatens my life with it. He
threatens blackmail with me. He assaulted me. He
pistol-whipped me and I asked the Bureau for help.

FS: . Did he try to throw you out the 18 story build-, window?
ML: Yes.

FS: He did what?

ML: , Yes, he tried to push me out the window.

FS: 18 stories?

ML: Yes, and I told him stay away, get back, because if

anything happens to me there's letters with the ;
Justice Department naming everything I know about you,

and he stopped cold. He threatened to shoot. my
daughter in the back. He's threatening her right
now with disgrace because she is the daughter of

the, of a well-known man. Right now my main concern
is the, these letters and the code and the tape and
possibly other things, are in the hands of this
Guiseppi Faisiano, and he wants money from me and
he's probably right now at the building. He is
casing the Soviets and he's going to try to go to
the same people that he has on the letters to tell
them that I was an informant for the FBI for revenge,
for having him arrested onthe assault charge with a
gun. He also wants money. He wants to disgrace the
FBI. He's blackmailing right now my husband, my ex-
husband, for the master keys of the Newberry. My
husband is calling me for help and I don't know what
to do. I asked Frank to help me. I gave him the
code because everybody refused. I was afraid to have
any-, anywhere. I guess Frank helped me before in
Cuba and I don't, I worked, he worked for me and I
worked for him and I don't. know where to go because,
the only ones that are helping me now are the local
police - in their lunch hours or when I'm too afraid
to leave the house they buy me milk and fruit for the
kids. And they'll take the children home when I get
a threat on the phone or a box in the mailbox or get
my back door shot at. I take my children and I put
them in the 23rd precinct.

They even, off duty...

The off-duty police, police officers take my children

home...
And they spend time at the house?

And they spend time at the house in their free time

‘when they should be home with their families.

FS: And even though you have saved their lives...

ML: I asked them please help me with this man, he has

Soviet documents, he's hurt me, he's hurt my

for nothing and they said they promised to do something
on this individual immigration-wise. So far he has

Honorable Mike Mansfield

Office of the Majority. Leader
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Mansfield:

On 27 January 1975, following adoption of S. Res. 21 creating the
Select Committee on Intelligence, you and Senator Hugh Scott requested
that the Central Intelligence Agency "not destroy, remove from [its]. pos-
session or control, or otherwise dispose or permit the disposal of any
records or documents which might have a bearing on the subjects under
investigation, including but not limited to all records or documents per~
taining in any way to the matters set out in section 2 of S. Res. 21. "

In response to this request, the Agency placed in effect a complete
moratorium on the destruction of records, including normal administrative
yecords scheduled for routine destruction. :

The purpose of this letter is to advise you that it is our intention to po
proceed with destruction of records, now that the Select Committee has
completed its investigation and issued its final report. We have so advised
Senator, Church. , -

Along with the backlog of routine administrative records, the Agency
will destroy records which were collected and maintained by the Agency .
and which were subject to investigation by the Rockefeller Commission
and the Select Committee. The Agency is required to destroy much of
this latter material by the Privacy Act of 1974 (P. L. 93-579) and by
Executive Order 11905. Of course, all records destruction will be fully
consistent with other applicable laws, Presidential directives, and the
requirements of pending litigation and Justice Department investigations.

_ : I trust you agree that this action is now necessary and appropriate,
and I would appreciate your confirmation of this understanding. :

Senator Mike Mansfield

Washington, L.C, 20510

Dear Senator Mansfield:

You may recall that some weeks ago you were kind enough to arrange a
meeting between myself and Mr. William Miller, of the staff of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence. You arranved this meeting for me so that I could
present documents, which I showed you, relating to possible CIA illegal activ-
ities in Indochina. Specifically, as you know, I have long been interested in
the problem of who carried out the massive defoliation raids against Cambodia,
one year prior to the U.%. incursions into that country and during a time when,
formally, there were normal relations between the United States and the Royal
government of Cambodia. After talking with you about the matter, I met, for

, about one-half hour, with Er. Miller and showed him the documents I showed you.
' He made some notes and assured me that the question. of possible illegal activ- .
ities of the CIA in Indochina, including Cambodia, was on the agenda of his
committee. Sometime ago, I wrote ir. Miller to find out when he expected the
committee might look into Indochina. However, as has been the case since
‘ugust, with respect to communications from this coms tee, I have as yet re-
ceived no answer, not even an acknowledgement of receipt. T have just read
in the press that the Senate Intelligence Committee expects again to look at-
Chile, Cuba, etc., but there is no. indication of any interest in Indochina.
I would greatly appreciate your help in learning whether, in fact, the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence will look into possible illegal coWert opera~
tions of '.5. intelligence agencies in Indochina. I would also appreciate I

your views as to what I should do to get an investigation of the massive clan-
destine herbicide attack on Cambodia (1969). This was a unique operation in
technological history of foreign relations and as a biologist I am most. inter-
ested and concerned to get the full story on this bizarre incident. if the
Senate ‘elect Committee will not ask obvious questions of the intelligence

to Professor E. W. Pfeiffer of the University of

a letter he hed written
Montanz,; stating that Senator Church had reHable information that Aix
America was ‘xes ponsible for defoliation operations in Cambodia. A

copy of Senator Church's letter had been sent to the Director for comment

by Professor Arthux/H. Westing, Windham College jn Vermont. 1.

explained to the Senator we were much concerned over this allegation and

ed me to deny it categorically. Tadded that while wei -

the Director authoria

were not prying into the identity of the Senator's source, ,.we were curious
as to whether. this source's allegations were based on honest mistake or -
malice. Ifthe former, I suggested the Senator might wish to straighten

him out. Senator Church said he couldn't remember off hand where he

Jearned this information but would check his files. He said he fully accepted”.

With Respect to Intelligence Activities
Room 607, Capitol Hill Hotel .

Dear Mr. Miller:

Recently I discussed with Dr. E. W. Pfeiffer, University of Montana

zoologist, an incident in which he has had an abiding concern: the. °.
herbicide attack that occurred in eastern Cambodia in the spring of ae
1969. ;

As I understand it, from my talks with:Dr. Pfeiffer and from my
review of the correspondence he has received from various agencies,
there is no doubt that the attack actually occurred, that it was
large and sipnificant, and that the nature of the chemicals and
aircraft involved indicate that the U.S. hada direct role in
carrying it out.

. Yet it seems the state. and Defense departments, the CIA and the
"nrivate" CIA-affiliate Air America have all denied in one way or
another that they conducted the attack.

‘The obvious question is who did make the attack? Who ordered it,
why was it ordered and under what authority? Dr. Pfeiffer has ©
indicated your committee is looking into this matter and that-the
affair may ultimately be discussed in-the.course of Select Committees
hearings at some point.

Is it possible for you to tell me the status of your inguiry? Would
a. it be anpropriate at this time for our newspaper to interview Dr.
Pfeiffer and write-a news story on the documents he has received,
it ‘or would such a stuely bénefit from new information your committee
“. . efforts may resurrect within the near future?

- _Thanks in advance for your interest. We have followed’ with great
‘interest the Select Committee efforts to date.

Dear Mr. Miller:

Through the good offices of Senator Mansfield, we met, some
weeks ago to discuss certain problems related to possibiqCIA
activity in Cambodia. As you know,I am particularly interested
in why the CIA cannot or will not find out who carried out the
massive herbicide attack against Cambodia in the spring of 1969.
The CIA has under the Freedom of Information Act provided me
with some documents from my file which bear directly upon this
strange episode and Senator Church's efforts to find out information
for me. When we met you indicated that CIA activities in Indochina
were to be investigated by the Select Committee. I would greatly —
appreciate krowing about when you think this subject will come
up. I would also very much Like to submit some of the documents
I have received from the CIA and my personal testimony to. the
Committee. I believe that Professor A. Westing and myself were
the last official guests of the Sihanouk regime before it was
temporarily deposed. .

I look forward to hearing from you on these matters.

Sincerely yours,

He informed me that CIA-directed activities hostile to his

these activities are being launched from bases in Thailand.
I would greatly appreciate your assistance in finding out for

Subject: Relevance to S. Res. 60 of John Rosselli's -
: . ,testimony about his CIA activities -- --

Summary: |

; John Rosselli and his attomey, Tom Wadden, object to
testifying about. Rosselli's involvement with Robert Maheu ina’:: =:
CIA~financed plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in the early 1960's 2c)
The objection is based upon national security grounds.as wellas

an assertion by Mr. Wadden that the material is not relevant to

our inquiry under S. Res. 60.

: Testimony of Mr. ‘Rosselli about this matter is relevant
and necessary to our investigation for a variety of reasons.

Facts; -

-. .* During the last year of the Eisenhower Administration, the.
CIA apparently financed and organized a plot to assassinate Fidel
Castro. Among the participants in this Plot were Robert Maheu and
John Rossellt. Maheu had a ‘public relations business at the time,...
and Rosselli was associated with some alleged organized crime
figures (e.g. Sam Giancana) who had lost substantial gambling -
investments when Castro came to Power. Apparently, the plot
continued into the early 1960's even after the abortive Bay of Pigs
invasion, but it failed in attaining its objective of killing Castro,

Only a few officials in the government knew of the exis-

tae ASsigtadt Attomey ‘General ‘Wilson next requested the sécret
Justice file in early 1971 in connection with his interview of Robert .
Maheu on January 27, 1971 (see attached chronology). This interview

at the Department of Justice, in lieu of a grand jury appearance, was
arranged by a telephone call to Attorney General Mitchell on January 19,
1971, only one day after Jack Anderson published his first column linking
both Maheu and Rosselli to the CIA plot to 0 kill Castro.” (see attached)

"However, the ‘Significance of Anderson’ 8 column. on January 18,
1971, was that on the same day, Haldeman requested Dean.to find out-:
what he could about the Hughes - Maheu - O'Brien relationship.

: In the follow-up memos from Caulfield to Dean on the Maheu-
O'Brien link, Caulfield notes Maheu's prior "covert activities" for the
CIA and advises Dean that a check into CIA, FBI, and IRS files on Robert
‘Maheu is advisable to avoid a "counter-scandal."

In addition, Assistant Attorney General Wilson showed the
sensitive "Castro file” to Attorney General Mitchell, in January, 1971,
and discussed with him the political implications of the information.

- Following the on-the-record interview of Maheu on January 27, 1971,
by Lynch, Wilson and Petersen, Maheu was interviewed privately by
Wilson concerning his prior CIA activities with John Rosselli... Maheu
was not forthcoming with information about the plot at that time.
Attorney General Mitchell discussed the contents of the sensitive file
with President Nixon, according to Wilson,.who had advised him to do
so. ae ; ; .

~ Conclusion:

Therefore, the obsession of the Administration in keeping tabs
on Larry O'Brien in 1971 and 1972 was in part motivated by a fear that
Maheu would impart some of this sensitive information about the plot

~3-

_ to O'Brien, Alternatively the objective was to discover if there was .
any information about the plot that might be daniaging to the Democrats
that O'Brien might possess from Maheu. And these concerns could
have been a possible motivation for the break-in to the offices of the
DNC and Larry O'Brien by four Cuban~Americans on June W7, 1972,
especially since their directions were to photograph any documents" °
relating to Cuban contributions or Cuban involvement in the 1972 °°

MEMORANDUM

John Rosselli is actually Filippo Sacco, born July 4, 1905,

in Italy of ‘parents Vincenzo and Maria Sacco. Vincenzo Sacco

came to the United States after the birth of Filippo, his oldest of

child, and in 1911, Mrs. Sacco and Filippo joined Vincenzo in
the United States where they resided as aliens in East Boston.
.Filippo Sacco completed the sixth grade in the public

schools of East Boston and was discharged from school. in 1917. -

By this ‘time Filippo had two younger brothers and two younger a
sisters. In 1918, Vincenzo Sacco died. His wife Maria and the
five children moved into the residence of Liberato Cianciulli ©

pt eet ee eg tet eee

and a daughter was born in 1920. In 1922, Maria and Glanciulli i

were married. .
In 1922, Filippo had a job driving a horse-drawn milk

wagon and was nicknamed "Milky". However, in addition to his

legitimate occupation, Filippo had made connections with the

criminal element in East Boston and was engaged innarcotic

" traffie with his headquarters in and around Maverick Square.

On September 14, 1922, Filippo sold morphine to a government
informant: named Fisher while under surveillance by a narcotic
agent. On September 19, 1922, Filippo arranged for a large .
sale from his "source" and was present and under agent sure
veillance when the ‘morphine was delivered, On September 29,
1922, Filippo Sacco and his “source” were arrested by Federal
narcotics agents. On October 18, 1922, the Federal Grand Jury
in Boston indicted Sacco for the sale of narcotic drugs and
two days later he was released on bail, While awaiting trial
in the narcotics case, in Federal Court, Sacco was arrested and
indicted in Massachusetts State Court for grand larceny and

was released on bail on July 2, 1923.

In 1923, while he was on bail awaiting trial in the

narcotics and larceny cases, Filippo Sacco jumped bail in both

cases and disappeared from East Boston. The Government narcotics -

informant, Fisher, disappeared about the same time and Covernment
sources believe that he may have been killed to _prevent him from
testifying. Because of his fugitive status, both | indictments
against Sacco. were dropped.

o ‘After Sacco’ 8 ‘flight from his home in 1 1923, he ‘spent some.

time in Rew York and Chicago, and finally made his appearance in -

Los” Angeles in “1924 under the fictitious name "John Roselli.”

Sources indicate that Sacco engaged in bootlegging. and hijacking

during this period and police records show he was frequently

arrested. on such charges as carrying concealed weapons, and sus- ..

' picion of robbery.

After 1930, Sacco became associated with the Al Capone

gang in Chicago and was also closely associated with organized

erime in Los Angeles. Reliable sources relate that he was an

executioner’ for. the criminal organizations in both cities, In

1936, by. demands and. threats, Sacco forced his way into part

ownership of "Nationwide News Service," "a horseracing information

service used by bookmakers across the country.

‘ After prohibition was repealed, Sacco left the ‘bootlegging -

business and associated himself with Columbia Picture Studios.
As a close friend of Los Angeles underworld leader Jack Dragna,

Sacee soon became known as a labor muscleman and racketeer for

the movie studios. In 1943, Sacco was indicted on a charge of

conspiracy to extort millions of dollars from movie producers

and a labor union. Also indicted were union cfficials Browne

and Biofé, and the following ranking members of the Chicago La
Cosa Nostra family: Frank Nitto (aka Nitti), Louis Campagna,

Paul DeLucia (aka Paul “the waiter" Ricia), Phil D'Andrea,

_ Francis Manitote (aka Frank Diamond), and Charles “Cherry Nose”

Gioe. In 1944, Sacco and the Chicago defendants were convicted
and all were sentenced to ten years in prison.

In 1947, Sacco and all his co-defendants were paroled

immediately upon their becoming eligible therefor. There were |
indications that their release had been secured by bribery but
admissible evidence sufficient for prosecution was: not. obtained.

In July - 1948, Sacco's parole was revoked because of his con= =|

tinued association with known criminals and he was “imprisoned
until Rovember 1948, when his parole was reinstated. “Shortly

warned the defendants that if anything happened to Bioff while
they were on parole he would hold them responsible.) Two other

and again associated himself with a ‘movie studio. Reliable

sources report that this was a front and in fact, through his -

the responsibility of overseeing the concealed interests. in
Las Vegas casinos of the Chicago underworld. Sacco immediately
became a powerful figure im Las Vegas. He ‘travels back and
forth between Las Vegas and Los Angeles extensively and asso-~
ciates with the kmown Cosa Nostra members and major gamblers.

Rosselli appeared before the Kefauver Committee investi-
gating organized crime and falsely testified concerning his
association with underworld figures and even his ow personal
background.

During the period 1956- 1958, Sacco was very active in

the construction and pre-opening operation of the Tropicana Hotel,

In May 1968, Sacco was convicted of failing to register as

an alien and report his address annually. In the course of that -
"trial, it was shown that birth records in Chicago, ‘Tilinois, had ~
“béen forged in an effort to make it. appear that Sacco chad been

born there as John Rosselli. Sacco has long been | a close friend

Subject: Interview of John Roselli

co, On Wednesday February 20, 1974, Scott Armstrong, Mare Lackritz and Bob. -
Muse interviewed John Roselli at the office of Roselli's attorney, Tom Wadden, 7 -
888 17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C., telephone 833-1440. Also present were
Wadden's associates Bryan B. McMenamin and Leslie Scherr. Toe a

. “5

- +... Wadden began the interview by noting that for the first time, he had -
” discussed with Roselli the Maheu Cuban matter with which we were concerned; and =~
found that it presented a great problem of national security. Accordingly he had —

tried to reach Senator Ervin, an old acquaintance, and see if he could persuade the

Senator from allowing this interview to go forward. He did not get in touch with

Ervin directly put talked, to'a staff member in Ervin's office, whom he would nots.

:" identify. He further noted that, Roselli was insistent upon not giving any informatior

about his Cuban activities and would rather go to Jail than be compelled to testify
about the matter. Thus the interview was’ not’productive insofar as Roselli's

“{nvolvement with Maheu in 3960 ,was, concerned. “However Wadden did allow us to inter-

view Roselli aboat his background and we reserved. the right to have ad executive»,

session before a Senator where John Roselli might be compelled ‘to testify about his”
involvement, with Mahe’ in Cuba.’ (It should be noted _that Wadden would not identity

his privilege claim other tha related to national’ security. )> > i:)950.

. ~" John Roselli presently resides with his sister and brother-in-law, a Mr. _
_ and Mrs. Joseph Daigle at 522 Southwest Temp Corner,, Plantation, Florida 33314. His
' telephone number there is area.305 581-6585. He hag been living in retirement with

- them since he left jail at the end of last summer. Prior to moving to Florida he
had been in the federal prison for thirty-three months, having been convicted in the
Friar's Club case, a conspiracy in which he was charged along with Maurice Friedman,
Benjamin Teitlebaum, and Manuel Jacobs. (He noted that Hank Greenspun had no involve-

ment either as a co-defendant or unindicted co-conspirator in that case.)

n With regard Bob Maheu, he met Maheu for. the first time in the mid-50's
: in either Washington or, California through a mitual acquaintance, Herman Spitzel.
When questions were asked as to what his subsequent involvement with Maheu was,
Roselli's attorney instructed him not to answer any questions on the ground of
national security. °° .~ eB SST pe rae a

_. Roselli did however indicate how he and Mahew had made arrangements for |
Hughes to live at the Desert Inn when Hughes first arrived there in late 1966. He
said that he had received a call from Meheu, who needed to make arrangements for
Hughes to move to Las Vegas from Boston. According to Maheu, no one wanted to give
Hughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles
and went up to Las Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who owned 13% of
the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the penthouses-
at the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu was in charge of security and responsible for
oe. seeing that Hughes arrived unnoticed in Las Vegas. Kolod acquiesced and told
“ly Rogellt that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be available at the going rate,
but that they would have to leave the hotel by New Years. When the New Years date .
was approaching, Maheu called and said that they had received notice from Kolod and
“were suppose to leave their premises. Roselli then convinced Kolod to ellow them ..
to stay. At the same time he told Maheu that Hughes should buy the Hotels and
any problems. Maheu responded that he was of the impression that. Hughes 4

50
want to get involved in any of the gambling businesses and would not therefore want
to purchase the hotel. It was at this point that Roselli conceived of the idea of
trying to sell the hotel, and approached Kolod and asked if he would be willing to
sell it. Kolod replied that if Roselli could make arrangements to sell it he would
receive a finder's fee. Roselli then turned around and-asked Maheu if he wanted to
purchase it. Maheu responded that he would and Roselli turned the matter over to
his attorney Ed Morgam who then handled the matter until the end. Roselli also
instigated some talk about the possibility of purchasing the Sands and, while he did
not negotiate it, received at a later date from %d Morgan a check for $95,000 which -
represented his finder's fee for the sale of both the Desert Inn and the Sands. -.

Roselli noted that while Moe Dalitz was the owner of the Desert Inn, he -~
did not negotiate with him because he found him less agreeable than Kolod. He said
that he had some minor dealings with Dalitz but none of. them related to matters |
concerning the Las Vegas hotel industry. eo ee

With regard to Ed Morgan, Roselli met him in the middle 50's. Since that
time Morgan has represented him in different Las Vegas intereste. He noted that
Morgan did not represent him in his Friars’ Club defense(but—did_arrange—for-—Jin
Cantillion, a Los Angeles attorney handled the matter). He said that he had no
trouble with Morgan's handling of the Desert Inn finder's fee, since he trusted
Morgan implicity. He noted that Morgan had arranged for John Roselli to be represent

by Tom Wadden, his present attorney. This representation first began on the appeal
from the Friar's Club. ; : Do
Roselli indicated’ that his only present interest in Las Vegas concerns. —
his holdings in the gift shop at the Frontier hotel. His involvement there started
. in 1967 when he had an arrangement with Mr. Friedman. This set-up did not work out
} and Roselli resigned as President of the gift shop. Thereafter he made an arrange-
ment with a Mr. Breen whereby he would furnish Breen with money and indemnify hin
yo against any losses if Breen would run the gift shop. This arrangement has worked
H out fairly well and he continues to receive his share of the profits each year from
the gift shop. He mentioned that it was his opinion that Breen had been poorly
3 treated by the Hughes enterprises, since Hughes first purchased the Frontier. He
. recalls, at his last meeting with Meheu, asking Maheu to lend Breen $40,000 for the
i ' gift shop. Maheu said he would get back to him but never did. Ultimately a loan
was arranged through Perry Thomas at. the Valley Bank of Nevada.

tT : Since 1967 Roselli has’ seen Maheu only once. And while he does not recall
the date of that meeting he remembers that it was in Los Angeles before Maheu had
terminated with Hughes. He recalls that Maheu was in Los Angeles at the tine while
; his wife was having a foot operation, and that he called Roselli to have supper.
= Roselli has no recollection of the conversation that the two had at supper other
than that they discussed, as noted above, the possibility of arranging a loan for

Breen at the Frontier Hotel Gift Shop.

: ; He said he has known Peter Maheu since the middle 1950's and that he went
to Peter's wedding reception. His only involvement with Peter occurred whenever
Robert Maheu wanted a message conveyed to Roselli. He recalls no eubsequent Svbstantie

Subject: Interview of John Roselit

ces On Weanesday ‘February 20, “lors, “scott, Armstrong, Mare Lackritz and Bol

. “Vaden began the “interview by noting. ‘that. ‘for the first. tine, he. had.

: discussed’ with Roselli the Maheu Cuban matter with which we were concerned;” and

found that it presented a great problem of national security. Accordingly he_ had
tried to reach Senator Ervin, | an old acquaintance, and see if he could persuade. the
Senator from ‘allowing this interview to go forward. He did not get in touch with
Ervin directly put talked, to ‘a ‘starr. ‘member in Ervin's office, whom he would not .
identify. He further’ noted that, Roselli was insistent upon not giving any informatior
about his Cuban activities and “would” rather, go to jail than be compelled to testify
about the matter. Thus the interview. “was “not* “productive insofar_as Roselli's
involvement with Maheu ‘in 3960 | was. ‘concerned, “However, Wadden ‘aia allow us to inter=
‘view Roselli about his “background _ and ‘we “réserved, the right ‘to have an ‘executive: =

_ and Mrs. Joseph” Daigle at 222 Southvest Temp. Corner), 1 Plantation, ' Florida 33314. His

. telephone number there is’ area305 581-6585." He has “been living in retirement with
_them since he left jail at the end of last summer. Prior to moving to Florida he

had been in the federal prison for thirty-three months, having been convicted in the

Friar's Club case, a conspiracy in which he was charged along with Maurice Friedman,

Benjamin Teitlebaum, and Manuel Jacobs. (He noted that Hank Greenspun had no involve-

ment either as a co-defendant or unindicted co-conspirator in that case.)

With regard” “Bob Maheu, he met Maheu for. the ‘first time in the mid-50's
in either Washington or California through. a. mutual acquaintance, Herman Spitzel.
When questions were asked as ‘to what his subsequent involvement with Maheu was,
Roselli's attorney instructed, him not to! answer any questions on the ground of..
national security.” . ot, .

“Roselli did however indicate how he and Maheu had made arrangements for

Hughes to live at the Desert Inn when Hughes. first arrived there in late 1966. He
_ said that he had received a call from Maheu, who ‘needed to make arrangements for
Hughes to move to Las Vegas from Boston. According to Maheu, no one wanted to give
Hughes any rooms. Roselli at the request of Maheu left his residence in Los Angeles
-and went up to Ias Vegas and asked his acquaintance Ruby Kolod, who owned 13% of |
the Desert Inn, to accommodate Hughes and allow him to take two of the. penthouses-
at the Desert Inn. At the time Maheu was in charge of security and responsible for
seeing that Hughes arrived unnoticed in Las Vegas. Kolod acquiesced and told”
Roselli that the top floor of the Desert Inn would be ‘available at the “going rate,
put that they would have to leave the hotel by New Years. When the New Years date
was approaching, Maheu called and said that they had received. notice from Kolod and
“were suppose to leave their premises. Roselli then convinced ‘Kolod to allow then .
At the same time ‘he told Maheu that Hughes should buy the Hotels‘: al avoid —
‘ resp ded that. he was of the Ampression that Hughes. “aldo

want to get involved in any of the gambling businesses and would not therefore want
to purchase the hotel. It was at this point that Roselli conceived of the idea of
: trying to sell the hotel, and approached Kolod and asked if he would be willing to
i sell it. Kolod replied that if Roselli could make arrangements to sell it he would
receive a finder's fee. Roselli then turned around and-asked Maheu if he wanted to
purchase it. Maheu responded that he would and Roselli”turned the matter over to
his attorney Fd Morgan who then handled the matter until the end. Roselli also .
instigated some talk about the possibility of purchasing the Sands and, while he did
not negotiate it, received at a later date from "4 Morgan a check for b95 ,000 which .
represented his finder's fee for the sale of both the Desert Inn and the Sands.

Roselli noted that while Moe Dalitz was the owner of the Desert Inn, he’. ~
did not negotiate with him because he found him less agreeable than Kolod. He said
that he had some minor dealings with Dalitz but none of them related to matters ——
concerning the Las Vegas hotel industry. . Cee Re ——

With regard to Ed Morgan, Roselli met him in the middle 50's. Since that
time Morgan has represented him in different Las Vegas interests. He noted that
Morgan did not represent him in his Friars’ Club defense(but—did_arrange—for-—Jdin
Cantillion, a Los Angeles attorney handled’ the matter). He said that he had no
trouble with Morgan's handling of the Desert Inn finder's fee, since he trusted
Morgan.implicity. He noted that Morgan had arranged for John Roselli to be represent
by Tom Wadden, his present attorney. This representation first began on the appeal
from the Friar's Club. : : 2

Roselli indicated’ that his only present interest in Las Vegas concerns. .
his holdings in the gift shop at the Frontier hotel. His involvement there started
in 1967 when he had an arrangement with Mr. Friedman. This set-up did not work out
and Roselli resigned as President of the gift shop. Thereafter he made an arrange-
‘ment with a Mr. Breen whereby he would furnish Breen with money and indemnify him
4 against any losses if Breen would run the gift shop. This arrangement has worked
3 out fairly well and he continues to receive his share of the profits each year from

the gift shop. He mentioned that it was his opinion that Rreen had been poorly
treated by the Hughes enterprises, since Hughes first purchased the Frontier. He
: recalis, at his last meeting with Maheu, asking Maheu to lend Breen $60,000 for the
4 gift shop. Maheu said he would get back to him but never did. Ultimately a loan
was arranged’ through Perry Thomas at the Valley Bank of Nevada.

2 amcememmememectintinetin ct mt

: Since 1967 Roselli has’ seen Maheu only once. And while he does not recall
the date of that meeting he remembers that it was in Los Angeles before Maheu had
terminated with Hughes. He recalls that Maheu was in Ios Angeles at the time while
his wife was having a foot operation, and that he called Roselli to have supper.
Roselli has no recollection of the conversation that the two had at supper other
than that they discussed, as noted above, the possibility of arranging a loan for
Breen at the Frontier Hotel Gift Shop. ~ ; .

He said he has known Peter Maheu since the middle 1950's and that he went
to Peter's wedding reception. His only involvement with Peter occurred whenever
Robert Maheu wanted a message conveyed to Roselli. He recalls no aubsequent Subs f w
discussions with Peter Maheu. ; . .

were not true that he had personally intervened with the Justice

Department in order to mitigate the government's prosecution of

Rosselli on the basis that Rosselli had done a- formidable service
for his country. Harvey said “this isa long story . . . I don't
think it ought to be printed." I asked him whether it was not
true that he had a high regard for Rosselli. "I still do," he
earnestly replied.

5. In pursuing the story further, I called Harvey

again in Indianapolis in February and askea him whether he could | .

June 24, 1974 tescinony of John Rosselli before Committee
Senator \Church presiding :

Los Angeles

Rosselli first met Maheu in approximately July, 1960,

pursuant to a telephone call from Maheu. At their first
meeting, Maheu told Rosselli that a high government official
had requested that Maheu recruit Rosselli to "fight Communism
90 miles away from Florida" -- to recruit Cubans to assassinate
Castro.

New York

Rosselli had second meeting with Maheu and went to New York
in September under the alias of John Rawlston [Castro was
in New York at this time]. Rosselli met Jim O'Connell of
CIA, plus "three others."

Florida

O'Connell, Maheu and Rosselli met in Florida hotel approxi-
mately one week after New York. Rosselli introduced Giancana
to Maheu. Also introduced X (Trafficante) to Maheu. Obtained
permission from Maheu to bring Giancanainto project.

Rosselli recruits Cuban #1, Rosselli's cover was as Wall Street
businessman. Rosselli and Maheu agree on a $250,000 price tag
for the job.

O'Connell never met Cubans. Trafficante, Cubans and Maheu met.
Maheu brought $10,000 and poison capsules. ~

Rosselli told Giancana about CIA involvement to keep his mouth.
shut. Rosselli only had one discussion with Giancana.

O'Connell called Rosselli after Bay of Pigs. Met in Florida
not long after Bay of Pigs with William Harvey, O'Connell and
Rosselli, Harvey-told Rosselli that he wanted Rosselli to :
have nothing to do with Maheu and not to use Giancana connections.

Rosselli indicates that pro-Castro people in Florida probably
had inkling of assassination attempts.

During Missle Crisis, Harvey asked Rosselli to see if "they"
had any intelligence on us, on.the missiles. ;

FBI agents Hill and Dodge met with Rosselli and his lawyer,
Cantillon. At this time Dodge informed Rosselli that the

FBI was aware that he was not a U.S. citizen. Dodge indicated
something about Nevada and some other secret organizations.

Rosselli met with Sheffield Edwards in 1966 for some drinks
and discussed his problems with the FBI.

Rosselli received a telephone call from an FBI agent, Jack
Barron in June of 1970. The agent informed Rosselli that his
appeals can be reversed. He was told that his lawyers and
friends can't do anything for him in Washington.

Rosselli talked with Bill Harvey prior to his testimony before
the Select Committee to see if Harvey had objections and

Harvey only suggested that Rosselli protect those people whose
lives and whose families might be jeopardized by his testimony.

Rosselli stated he did not know the five so-called Watergate
burglars -- Hunt, McCord, Barker, Martinez or Sturgis.

Roselli had no doubt -that the Cuban operation was on behalf
of the CIA and not Mr. Hughes.

Rosselli stated that his Cuban contacts were never informed .
that this was a CIA project, but that ‘he represented a Wall
Street business.

“In the period 1967-1968, Rosselli failed to register as an

alien and faced criminal charges.

Rosselli describes how he is brought into the operation --
Maheu's contact: and O'Connell's satisfying him that they
were government representatives.

Rosselli stated that Sheffield Edwards was not overly concerned
with the FBI's contacting Rosselli.

Rossell's reason for not informing his sources that it was
a CIA operation was because he believed he would be more
successful doing what he was doing by representing big

business.

When the FBI contacted Rosselli in both 1966 and 1970
they hinted that they wanted Rosselli to provide information
about United States gambling interests.

BW 50955 Bocld:32423630 Page 356
p. 44 After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the whole operation came
to a halt and Rosselli said he was never in contact with
the Cubans again.

p. 45-46 Rosselli met Harvey at Dulles Airport in Washington after
the Missile Crisis, in June 1963, and had dinner with him
in Washington that night.

p. 47 Rosselli mentions FBI had him under surveillance for several
years. : a
‘p. 47 Roselli has two stories re Rowan wiretap from Maheu. Maheu

told him he wanted Rosselli to get some bail money for two
guys in Las Vegas who were in trouble and he had placed some
taps in Rowan's room because 1) Maheu was doing Giancana a
favor, and 2) Maheu had the authority to see if Giancana was
leaking to his girlfriend.

p. 52 Rosselli arranged bail money for the two men who were caught
: : tapping Rowan's room.

p. 52 Giancana laughed when Rosselli discussed tapping incident with
; him, but gave no clues to the reason for the tap.

p. 54-55  Rosselli:met in New York with O'Connelland Harvey in April

1962.

p. 58 Rosselli states to the Committee that he felt the CIA came
to him because he has contacts in Cuba.

Pp. 59 - Rosselli states he took on "project" because it was’ the
government; he was patriotic.

Pp. 61 Rosselli knew Trafficante before “operation” started.

“p. 62 Rosselli maintained some contact with Maheu after Harvey took
over. : : . a

p. 64 Rosselli still is social friends with Harvey.

p. 66 In April or May of 1966, Rosselli was stopped in the street

by two FBI agents with note saying to meet him later. Rosselli
referred them to his attorney, Mr. Cantillon

-Howard--

In re your "battle plan" memo to Hart
and Garn, I think you should consider possible
wis mm of our Committee making some kind of
very low-key anouncement that we're doing
something. Purpose would be two-fold--to
prevent getting wholly co-opted by new
House Committee (and agencies making a
claim that since House is doing it, they can
ignore us---also to put House on notice there
is specific area we have carved and will
‘continue to carve out for ourselves). Most
important, we must do something affrrmative to
insure that the sources out there come to us.
If we say nothing, potentials which just go
to House, under assumption that that's the onl
thing going on.

Attached is the type of low-key someone
could say/ in response to an inquiry (which
I assume Spencer gets lots of).

Kennedy and th

onspiracy theories are fashionable,
‘sometimes even fruitful, as in the
case of Watergate. So it is not surprising
that recent revelations of the Senate In-
telligence Committee have resurrected
an old question: what connection, ifany,
did the Castro government have with the
assassination of John F. Kennedy?
Current speculation is that the Cuban
dictator, having learned of CIA plots
against his life, decided to strike back,
returning violence for violence, with
consequences that are now history. In-
deed, the recent report of the Schweiker-
Hirt task force, while finding no hard
evidence to support this theory, did un-
cover some interesting new leads. More

_ than that, it established that a CIA-FBI

“cover-up” had deprived the Warren
commission of vital information that pre-
vented it from: seriously exploring the
possibility of Castro’s involvement and
that consequeritry~ there is no longer any

reason to have faith in its picture of the _

Kennedy assassination.”

And so we may well have a reopening
of the ingestigation. At last.

Giver all this, it seems appropriate to
examine the record of the period. A small
but interesting body of published testi-
mony and reminiscences describes and
amply documents a little-known cam-
paign of accommodation launched by
Washington and Havana in the weeks
preceding that fateful day in November
1963. Actually, the origins of this tenta-
tive and ultimately ill-fated rapproche-
ment may be traced to the previous
spring. when. Castro, increasingly de-
pendent on his Soviet sponsors, found
himself obliged to embrace the banner of

- “peaceful coexistence” in order to obtain
economic and military agreements need- _

ed to assure the continued development
of his revolution. In practical terms, this
meant the normalization. of relations
with the United States.

A MESSAGE FOR CASTRO
ft was not until September 1963, how-

ever, that this campaign began to show |

results, At that time, William Attwood, an
adviser to the U.S. delegation to the
United Nations, told his superiors he had
word that Castro wanted an accommoda-
tion. John Kennedy got the message and
approved a “discreet contact” with the
Cuban U.N. representative, Carlos Le-
chuga. Subsequently, communications
were established and meetings held

ss

|
'
|

t
to discuss the prospect of negotiations.
By early November, Kennedy had de-
cided ‘to push toward an opening with
Cuba in hopes of taking Castro out of the
Soviet fold and erasing the memory of
the Bay of Pigs. The Americans sought a
meeting to draw up an agenda for later
discussions. On Nov. 18, this message
was transmitted to Havana. Shortly
thereafter, Lechuga was instructed to set
forth such a plan for U.S. consideration.
Even as these developments were un-
folding, a second dialogue was taking
place through an unofficial envoy—the
French journalist Jean Daniel. On Oct.
24, Kennedy had received Daniel .in the
White House. The President, it seems,
had learned of the Frenchman's forth-
coming visit to Cuba and had decided to
seize the occasion to send Castro a mes-
sage. The essence of this communication
was a strong hint that the United States

‘would be willing to normalize relations

providing certain conditions were met.
What were those conditions? One, clear-
ly, was an end to Castroite subversion.
The U.S. had a special responsibility to
contain Communist expansionism. As
long as Havana continued to export revo-
lution, the economic “blockade” of the
island: would remain in effect.

ACCOMMODATIONS

Beyond this, not much was definite.
The American negotiating position had
not yet been worked out. Even so, hints
of possible Cuban participation in the
Alliance for Progress and of the desire of
the United States to see a decline in
Soviet influence on the island suggested
further avenues for discussion.

Bearing this message and an invitation
to revisit the White House upon his re-
tum, Daniel set off for Cuba. There he
found a remarkably receptive Fidel Cas-
tro. Indeed, during the course of a six-
hour interview the Ider mdximo found
occasion to praise the American Presi-

dent for his sincerity, realism and “good

ideas”: Kennedy might yet understand
that there could be “coexistence be-
tween capitalists and socialists, even in
the Americas.” Castro was convinced
that normal relations could be restored
“on the basis of mutual respect for sover-
eignty.” His country needed peace in
order to concentrate on the socio-eco-
nomic tasks of the revolution. The issue
of subversion would not be an obstacle.
Cubans would naturally “feel solidarity”

Donald E. Schuiz

e Cuban Connection

with their revolu-
tionary brethren in
other lands. But ul-
timately, each na-
tion would have to
determine its own
destiny, and “ifthey
choose regimes oth-
er than ours, this is not our business.”

This was two days prior to President
Kennedy’s death. :

I. mention these developments be-
cause they provide an important—and
perhaps crucial—frame of reference for
Congressional investigators and the pub-
lic alike: They are not, of course, proof of
innocence. But they are suggestive:
would Castro have been so intent on
coming to terms with a man he was
conspiring to kill? One may seriously
doubt it. In point of fact, the assassina-
tion would bring a quick end to Washing-
ton’s interest in accommodation. =~

POSSIBLE SCENARIOS

Still, this is not to rule out the possibil-
ity of a “Cuban connection.” Govern-
ments often behave in inconsistent and
self-defeating ways. Indeed, even as the
Kennedy Administration was taking
these first covert steps toward rap-
prochement, the CIA was engaged in an

attempt on Castro’s life. If, dug toalack ,

of political control and a prevailing at-
mosphere of cold-war hostility, U.S
agents could be conducting such activi-
ties in direct conflict with Presidential
policy, it is not difficult to imagine simi-
lar distortions on the Cuban side. Only a
few weeks earlier, Castro had publicly
denounced U.S.-sponsored assassina-

tions and even threatened retaliation.

Might not some overzealous security of-
ficials have taken this for tacit authority
to set up a “program of elimination”?

But all this remains speculation. It is. -

possible to envision any number of sce-
narios that might have led to. the fatal

events of Nov. 22. In lieu of hard evi-

dence, however, itseems only fairto give -

Castro the same benefit of the doubt that
Kennedy has been accorded—namely,
that he be considered innocent until
proved guilty. It is hoped that the inves-
tigations to come will proceed on the
basis of that assumption.

Schulz, a Ph.D. candidate in political
science at Ohio State University, is writ-
ing a book on the Cuban revolution.

concerning the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President
Kennedy is largely based on the investigative research

done by Peter Noves, a former CBS Producer and top inves- °.-
tigative reporter.

Last year, Noyes published a. book, Legacy of Doubt, which :
summed up many of his findings, and which generally outlines
what Noyes believes was heavy Mafia involvement in the
assassination. The Noyes book is almost entirely factual

and is largely based on substantiated information such as
police records provided by the FBI, the Los Angeles Police
Department, the California Attorney General's office, and
Texas police officials.

Though the Noyes book (like most recent assassination books)
@Gid not sell well or receive much press attention, it has
been regarded as a valuable contribution by most of author
Noyes! fellow Warren Commission critics.

It can definitely be said that almost all of Noyes' findings,
particularly with respect to his main character Jim Braden,
have been factually substantiated and are solidly established
by official police records.

Basically the Noyes book outlines the background of a

mysterious man who was picked uv by the police at the scene

of President Kennedy's assassination just minutes after the
shooting. The man was apprehended by a Dallas policeman who A
thought he was behaving suspiciously. The man, who identified
himself under the false name of Jim Braden, was released

shortly thereafter following brief questioning by the Dallas
Sheriff's Office. :

Author Noyes uncovered the story of Jim Braden and his
true identity during five years of investigative research.

And it is Jim Braden's true identity and his ironic misfortune
of being picked up at the scene of the aSsassination for

"looking suspicious" that the Warren Commission critics now
believe ranks with James McCord! s mistake of leaving masking
tape on the doors during the Watergate break- -in as the ultimate.
_ fatal slip-ups in the two conspiracies.

BW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 376
For Jim Braden, whose true identity is Eugene Hale Brading,
is aman with singularly awesome direct ties to the highest
levels of the Mafia. Of all the Mafia figures connected to
the syndicate's crucial security and enforcement activities
of coercion, maiming, intra-~syndicate assassination and
outside murder contracting, Jim Braden appears to be an
indispensable link - or leader - of organized crime's .

far flung network of “controlled violence" specialists

and professional hit men.

Braden's involvement with the Mafia's hiqhest echelon
“enforcers” has spanned the continent from coast to coast
and covers virtually every national crime syndicate juris-
diction, According to federal authorities working with the
Justice Department's organized crime strike force units, and
according to other high government sources cited by author
Noyes, Jim Braden is now serving as personal courier for
Meyer Lansky.

The importance of this mysterious man who was picked up
under a false name across the street from the Texas Book
Depository just moments after the shots were fired on
Yovember 22, 1963 cannot be overemphasized.

Though there were several innocent witnesses or bystanders
in the area of the assassination who were also arrested or
brought in for questioning by the Dallas police, all of whom
were shortly released like Jim Braden, his presence there at
that precise moment does in fact raise an incredible specter,
and may indeed have been the monumental slip-up that critics
of the Warren Commission now attest to.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 377
Jim Braden's Arrest On November 22

Deputy C.L. Lewis was one of the first Dallas police
officers on the scene at the Texas School Book Depository
following the assassination.

Within just minutes after the deadly shots were fired,
Deputy Lewis confronted a man across the street. from the
Book Depository, a man whom Lewis thought was "acting
suspiciously."

Deputy Lewis questioned the man for several minutes before
taking him to the Sheriff's office for further interrocation.
The man identified himself as Jim Braden, and said that he
was in the oil business in Beverly Hills. California. Deputy
Lewis became even more suspicious over the way the man first
tried to identify himself, Instead of producing his driver's
license, the common means of identification, the man pulled
out a gasoline credit card instead.

The man who identified himself as Jim Praden strongly protested
when Deputy Lewis told him that he would have to take him in
for further interrogation.

at the Sheriff's office, Jim Braden agreed to make a voluntary
Statement. Braden, then 48, told the police that he was in
Dallas on oil business and had been there for two days. He

said he was staying at the Cabana Motel, s short distance away
from the scene of the assassination. Braden said’he had been
walking down the street by the Texas Book Depository at the
time of the assassination and had been looking for a taxi cab.
Jin Braden further stated that he was confronted by Deputy |
Lewis inside a building across the street from the Depository
during an attempt to make a telephone call following the
shooting.

Braden was shortly thereafter released by the Dallas Sheriff's~*
office. Braden was not fingerprinted, nor was any check made
of possible criminal records relating to him.

two months later, in late January cf 1964, Jim Braden was
interviewed hy two FBI agents at his off ice in Beverly Hills.
The Warren Commission's investigation was then in full swing
and witnesses to the assassination were being questioned by
the FBI and other authorities, In his FBI interview, Braden
qave the same account as he had given to the Dallas police on
the day of the assassination. The FBI's official report on
Braden's interrogation further stated that, "Braden has no
information concerning the assassination and both Lee Harvey
Oswald and Jack Ruby are unknown to hin."

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 373
: Jim Draden's Truc Identity

In early 1969, Peter Moves, the investigative reporter.
whose book covers much of the information regarding Jim
Braden, began investigating the mysterious California
"oil man."

Moyes originally received a tip about Braden from a

former FBI agent who was then aiding District Attorney

Jim Garrison's investigation of the Kennedy assassination.
The PBI man told Noves of Braden's presence at the scene of
the assassination at the time of the shooting.

lioyes soon found that Jim Braden was no longer at either

of the addresses that he had given the Dallas police, and
had left no forwarding addresses,

Noves then had the California Department of Motor Vehicles
run a check on the license number that Braden had given to
the Dallas police at the Sheriff's office following the
assassination. Motor Vehicles told Noyes that Braden's
license (1751755) had been renewed by Braden in San Diego
county in Wovember of 1966. Braden has also listed new
business and home addresses, which interestingly were over
a hundred miles apart.

The Department of Motor Vehicles' records on Jim Braden
also showed that "Jim Braden" was not really’ his original
name. The license had actually been issued in the 1950's
to Eugene Hale Drading, which is Braden's true identity.

On September 10, 1963, just ten weeks before the assassination,
Eugene Nale-Brading had notified the Department that he had
legally changed his nane to Jim Braden, and he requested a

new license under that name, The license was granted.

Intrigued by the fact that Jim Braden was really a false
identity assumed by Eugene Brading, investigator Noves
contacted the Intelligence Division of. the California
Attorney Genoral's Office, and had a check run on the
mysterious Brading. :

Noves was told that Eugene Hale Brading “is a real bad guy.

He's got a long rap sheet and apparantly has Mafia connections."
Koyes shortly thereafter obtained a copy of Eugene Brading's
(Jim Braden's) police records.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 379
I
The Brading "rap sheet" contained an ineredible 35
seperate entries covering virtually every phase of
criminal activity, including mail fraud, embezzlement,
operating a gambling house in Miami, car theft, shop
lifting, receiving stolen vroperty, and sclling wartime
gas ration coupons on the black market.

Most of these arrests had been made under the name of
Sugene Male Brading, but the police dossier on him also
' ; showed a handful of other aliases, including Harry Eugene
_ Bradley, Gene Brady, James Lee Cole, James Bradley Lee,
and inevitably, Jim Braden.

"Jim Braden" was the last entry shown on Brading's
records.

Incredibly, investigator Noyes found that due to the fact
that the Dallas police had not fingerprinted Jim Braden or
run.a make on him, his truce identity of Eugene Brading was
never discovered by the FBI or the Warren Commission at the
time of their investigation of the assassination. The Warren
Commission had only routinely included Braden's short state~
ment about being in Dallas on "oil business" in a police
xhibit on witnesses contained.in Warren Commission Hearing's
Volume KIX. Jim Braden and his story had been accepted at
face value.

HW 50955 DoclId:32423630 Page 330
Jin Braden (Zucene Brading) And.The Uafia

Investigator Noyes began a thorough investigation of.
Braden based upon all available police records and
documents. :

What soon clearly comerged was a long record of involvement
by Braden (Brading) with many of the most notorious Mafia
leaders in the nation, a record of close association with
key figures in the national crime syndicate.

Following a string of arrests in the 1940's, ‘dating all
the wav back to his young adulthood, Eugene Brading had
moved to El Paso, Texas, in 1950.

(BRADING AND PEREIRA)

In El Paso, Brading became closely associated with Victor
Pereira, a man who was a close associate and confidante of
severa] Mafia members. Brading and Pereira became involved
in a number of schemes involving marriage to and embezzlement
of wealthy widows. : ; :

In 1951, Bracing and his close friend Pereira were arrested
by the FBI in New York on a fugitive warrant issued in Texas.
The two men were charged with embezzling over $50,000 from

a wealthy widow whom Pereira had married shortly before
flecing with her money. Brading and Pereira were soon con=
victed of the charges and were each sentenced to 12 years

in prison. ,

However, Brading and Pereira were out free during the three
years of their appeals, and Brading was later paroled in 1959
after having served just five years of his sentence,

(BRADING AND THE SMALDOHES)-

During the three years of freedom under thoir appeals of the
convictions, Brading and Pereira left Texas (following still
another fleecing of another wealthy widow) and moved to
Denver, Colorado. : : ,

In Denver, Brading became very closely associated with

two leading Mafia bosses in the Rocky Mountain area, Clyde
and Gene Smaldone,. ;

>

HW 50955 DBocld: 32423630 Page 381

, :

the Smaldone brothers, who were also known as “Checkers
and Flip Flon," were the Mafia leaders in charge of the
syndicate's vending-machine market which stretched from
the Rockies all the way to Chicago. Police records show
that at one time, the Smaldones virtually controlled the
entire Pueblo area of Colorado.

The Smaldone brothers were notorious for the brutal brand

of violence they practiced in their operations. Brading
(Draden) became involved in manv-transactions with the
Smaldones and became a close personal friend. Several years
later, after BPrading finally went to jail for the embezzlement
of the Texas widow, the Smaldone brothers reqularlyv wrote

to him in prison, seeking his advice on various financial
matters,

(BRADING AND CLARK AMD BAUMAI)

Brading and his friend Pereira later moved to Beverly Hills
in California. Shortly thereafter, Brading inevitably came
under investiaation by the Los Angeles Police Department
Intelligence Division's Mafia specialists.

In particular, the LAPD interest in Brading was focused on
his close association in Beverly Hills with two "oil specu-
lators" from 'Niami, Arthur Clark and Roger Bauman. Clark
and. Bauman were notorious Mafia figures with long police
records. :

Brading's friend Clark had been one of the ton leaders of
the famous Purple Gang of the Mafia, which had overated
out of Detroit and Youngstown. The Los aAnceles police had
mlaced Clark and Bauman under tight surveillance and had
compiled extensive information on their friendship with
Bradincg. :

In 1956, the Chief of Intelligence of the LAPD, Captain
James Namilton, sent a letter to the Crime Commission of
Greater Miami seeking information about Clark, Bauman, and
Brading.

Captain Namilton, who was known as one of the foremost

experts on the Nafia in the nation, asked the Miami Commission
(which was conducting extensive investigations of the Mafia)
to inform him as to the involvement of several associates of
Clark and Bauman. ;

Among those named was Eugene Brading.

Captain Hamilton's letter stated:

i

;
his Departmenti has under investigation Arthur
Lewis Clark, Sr., FBI 3709258, and a Roger Bauman.
These men are representing themselves as officials
of the Sunbsam O11 Company, 212 Roosevelt Theater
Building, Miami Beach, and both are spending money
very lavishly."

um

"Clark has been arrested several times and has been ~
associated with many confidence men and hoodlums such
as James’ Tratianno, Victor Poreira, Zuqene Brading,
Clarence Rhodes, Stephen Sambor and the Siraldone
brothers of Denver." :

‘As investigator Peter lioves points out, the men listed
with Brading in the letter, represent a virtual “Who's Who"
of organized crime leaders between California and the Midwest.

(BRADING AND FRATIANNO)

Of these top Hiafia men listed with Brading (Braden) perhans
the most important one is James Fratianno, also widely known
as “Jimmie The Weasel." Fratianno was knovn as perhaps the
“Mafia's highest ranking executioner in the nation.

In 1959, in his testimony before the Rackets Conmittee of
the California legislature, Captain Hamilton, the Chief of
LAPD Intelligence, stated that,

"Ve have longa considered Fratianno to
be the exccutioner for the Mafia on
the West Coast."

Captain Hamilton told the Rackets Committee that his Intelligence
Division had linked Jimmie Fratianno to at least sixteen Nafia
executions. ;

Fratianno had once been arrested for the attempted assassination
of Los Angeles Nafia head Mickey Cohen in 1949. Cohen had
survived the bloody shooting which took the lifc, of one of
his lieutenants. Fratianno. was later released due to insuf-

' ficient evidence. FPratianno used the alibi that he had been
at the home of Mafia associate Nick Licata the night of the
shooting. Licata -later became the new head of the Los Angeles
Mafia, and, perhaps significantly, was later given control of
the Mafia in Dallas, Texas.

AW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 383
Qo.

Jimmie Fratianno was also susnected of complicity in
the murders of two men in 1951. Two men who made the
.mistake of robbing the Mafia's Flamingo Hotel in Las
Vegas were found dead'in a parked car following the
robberv. Both of their skulls had been shattered bv
bullets fired behind the ear, apparantly in true Mafia
fashion.

Fratianno had also been linked to the famous murder of
llarry "“Nooky" Rothman, who had been another close
associate of Nickey Cohen, the Los Angeles Nafia head,
Also, Fratianno was also linked to the disappearance of
another top member of the Mickey Cohen gang, Frank Uiccoli.
Niccoli had mysteriously vanished following a late dinner
at Fratianno's home one night.

Fratianno was also linked to the brutal murder of a business-
man in northern California in 1952, Thomas Keen, a wealthy
gambler, had apparantly welched on a $80,000 gambling debt
that he owed the Mafia, and was blown to bits from a dynamite
charge hidden under the hood of his car. -

Fratianno later served a six year prison term (1954-1960) for
extortion. In later years Fratianno became the central fiqure
involved in LOOK. magazine's “expose” of San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto's alleged Mafia connections. LOOK alleged that
Fratianno had become a close friend of Mayor Alito and that

the Mayor had arranged for Fratianno to receive loans of over
$105,000 from a bank Where Alioto served as Chairman of the.
Board. Alioto admitted that Fratianno was a "casual acquaintance"
of his, but denicd that’ he had used any influence in the loans.
The Mayor also said that he had not known that the notorious
Fratianno was a member of the Nafia. :

(BRADING AND HELTZSR)

hile in Los Angeles, Brading (Jim Braden) also became
connected with ton Mafia leader Harold "“lianpy" Heltzer.
The LAPM Intelligence Division had originally become

aware of Brading's close relationship with Neltzer when
Brading's name was found on Neltzer's Christmas card list.
Meltzer was widely known as one of the most powerful Nafia
leaders in the entire nation. :

The U.S. Senate Rackets Committee identified Brading's
friend Meltzer as a ton Mafia boss in the areas of union
racketeering and narcotics.

HW 50955 DoclId: 32423630 . Page 364
19,

A revort of the Senate Rackets Committee from 1964 states:

"Meltzer now is reported to operate a large
bookmaking and prostitution syndicate in
California. A major figure in the organized
underworld, he is known to all. the important
narcotics traffichers throughout the United
States. He has also overated in Oklahoma,
Tenas, Baltimore, Niami, Las Vegas, Boston, .
and various areas of Canada, Cuba, liong Kong, i
Japan, Hawaii, and the Philippines."

(BRADIUG AID THE SICAS)

In Los celes, Brading also became closely associated with
vet another top Nafia operation. Brading becane a close
friend and associate of the notorious Sica brothers = Joe,
Preddie, and George. The Sica brothers were particularly
brutal syndicate members specializing in narcotics.

In 1950, the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles accused Brading's
friends, Joe and Freddie Sica, of heading the single largest
narcotics ring in the United States.

The Sica brothers were shortly thereafter brought to trial.

On the night before the trial onened, the government's

star witness, an informant named Aba Davidian, was mysteriously
shot to death in his mother's home in Fresno. The murder was
never solved and the Sica brothers were soon released for

lack of evidence.

Jim Draden: Possible Link To Jack Ruby

‘The same inadequate investigative work which led the
Warren Commission to largely overlook Jack Ruby's solid
Mafia involvement, apnears also to have been responsible
for the failure to uncover Jim Braden's true identity of
Eugene Brading during the official investigation into the
Kennedy assassination. :

As shown in the previous account of Jack Ruby's very
substantial ties to the Mafia, Ruby was particularly
involved in the syndicate areas of gambling and narcotics.

But bavond the multiplicity of evidence which indicates
that Jack Ruby and Jim Braden were both important Mafia
figures operating in the same general areas, at the same
general times, there is another single niece of evidence
which places both Ruby and Braden at the same place on the
day before the assassination.

Evidence indicatos that both Jim Braden and Jack Ruby
visited the Dallas offices of the H.L. Nunt Oil Company
on tho afternoon of Vovember 21, 1963, just twenty four,
hours before the President was murdered, Obviously any
link which places both Braden and Ruby in the same place
at the same time on the day before the assassination does
of course raise further significant questions about a
possible relationship between the two men.

On November 21, 1963, the day before the assassination,
Jim Braden checked in with the U.S. Parole Office in
Dallas. Accordina to Roger Carroll, the Chief Parole

fficer in Dallas, Draden (Brading) “advised that he
planned to see Lamar Hunt and other oil speculators while
here." Lamar Ilunt is the son of H.L. Hunt, the famous
right-wing oil billionaire.

AW 50955 DoclId: 32423630 Page 366
12.

aul Rotherme], a former FBI agent who was Director of
security for the Hunt Oil Commany in Dallas at that. time,
has’ recalled that he distinctly remembers Braden visiting
the Hunt offices on November 21 in the company of three
other men. Rothermel has stated that the office log for
Movember 21 showed that Roger Bauman (Brading's old Mafia
friend) and lNorqan Brown and Duane Nowlin “and friend"
visited the 'H!unt office on that afternoon. Rothermel states
hat Braden was definitely the "friend."
(Security chief Paul Rothermel was later fired by H.L. Hunt's
sons after reports allegedly surfaced that Rothermel was
"suspicious" of a possible Hunt connection to the assassin-
ation. Following his termination by the Hunts, Rothermel
found that he was being illoega 1llv wiretanped. “Rothermel
filed suit acainst Lamar Hunt and another one of HL. Hunt's
sons, charging them with the wireta spping, and asking for
soveral million dollars in damages. The suit, which has
produced very damaging cvidence against the Hunt. brothers,
is still in the courts.)

Also on November 21, the day before the assassination,
according to a conclusion of the Warren Commission, Jack

Ruby was also on his way to the H.L. Munt offices in Dallas.
The Uarren Commission concluded that Jack Ruby drove a woman
friend of his to the NWunt offices sometime that same after-
noon. The woman, who had declined work in Ruby's nightclub
as a stripper, drove with Ruby to the liunt offices, apparantly
in search of omploynent. This does coincide with Brad den!

isit to the same offices on that same afternoon.

The Yarren Commission inves tigated several other possible.
links of Jack Ruby to the Uunts, including the still
unexplained fact that Lamar Hunt's name was found inside
one of Ruby's notehooks. But of these possible links, the
Warren Commission concluded only that evidence did indicate
that Ruby had driven to the Hunt offices on Kovember 21.

Thus a possible Ruby-Braden connection on the day before
the President's assassination does indeed arise. :

Jim Braden: VYossible Link vo David Torrie

Investigator Peter Noyes has turned up several nieces.
of information which indicate a possible connection between
Jim Braden and the mysterious David Ferric.

David Ferrie was the homosexual airline pilot and nrivate
investicator whom Jim Garrison accused of participating

in the plot to assassinate President Kennedy. Six days after

District Attorney Garrison's charges were made public, David
Ferrie was found dead in his apartment in New Orleans. His

mysterious death was finally ruled to have been a suicide.

David Ferrie has been a taradet-of investigation ky critics

of the Warren Comnission ever since the assassination, In

fact the FBI and Secret Service both inve stiqated a possible
Perrie role immediately after the assassin: Tt was.
widely rumored in New Orleans and Dallas th at Ferrie was to
have flown the alleaed assassins out of the country following
the assassination. The Varren Commission decided not to include
the official Secret Service, and FBI ranorts on Ferrie in the ‘
26 Volumes of } nos which were released after the Uarren
Fenport was issued, However, the Justice Penartment did finally

Ee)
ta,
hte
"6

release those renorts to the National Archives in 1967 following

Garrison's vublic accusations.

Author Moyes has since established that both Jin Braden and
Davod Ferrie worked out of theyfloor of offices in a building
in New Orleans in the month.or two immediately preceding the
assassination.

This is particularly significant due to the fact that at that
time the mysterious David Ferrie was cmployed as a private
investigator by Carlos Marccllo, the top Hafia kingpin. It
is widely believed by most federal authorities that Carlos
Marcello ranks wi : close friend ever Lanstiv as one of
the two single most powerful leaders of the liafiats national
and international crime syndicate, Cantos _orcello heads the
baie empire centered in New Orleans, Louisiana, and controls
st of the Hafia activity in the southern part of the United
Btatec.

: :
In September and Octoher of 1963, just weeks before the
assassination, David Ferrie was working out of the offices

of Carlos Narcello's criminal attorney, G. Wray Gill. Ferrie,
who was doing investigative work on a nerjury charge that his
boss Marcello was then facing, worked out of Room 1707 in the
Pore liarguctte Building in New Orleans.

At this same time, in September. and October of 1963, Jim
Braden was operating out of Room 1701 in the Pere Marquette
Building.

HW 50955. Bacld: 32423630 Page 366
Braden was then commuting between Mew Orleans and

Beverly fills, with the approval of his Parole Board,
Braden was working as a representative of his Mafia
friend Roger Bauman, the oil speculator. Braden worked
out of Room 1701, which was the ‘office of his associate,
Victor Main, Jr., an oil geologist. This was just a short
way down the hall from David Ferrie. in: Room 1707.

Interestingly, in one visit to his Parole Office, Braden
"nistakenly" told his Parole Officer that he vas working
out of Room J70G - which would have heen the room nex =
door to Ferric - instead of Room 1701.

Thus a possible Bradecn-Ferrie connection in the weeks

just before the assassination does indeed arise in addition
to the rossiblo Braden-Ruby connection. Both connections
definitely do seem to fall outside of or beyond the areca
which coule reasonably be attributed to coincidence, cnance,
or circumstance.

,

Pevond several sets of information which tend: to indicate
that David Ferric had some contact with Lee Oswald at
various times; the critics of the Narren Commission have
particularly focused on Ferrie's ties to Carlos Marcello
and the Marcello Mafia empire.

In fact, in his interviews with the FBI and Secret Service
after the assassination, Ferrie claimed that he was with
Narcello at the very time of the assassination. Ferrie
stated that he was in court with Harcello on the afternoon
of November 22, which does appear to be truc.

Carlos Narcello, along with Meyer Lansky, had become the
central targets of the Justice Denartment's Organized
Crime Division in the carly 1960's, under the vigorous
.direction of Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

Marcello, known as "fhe Little Man," became one of Attorney
Goneral hannedy's most fierce enemies during that neriod.
Marcello once claimed that he had been kidnapped under orders
of Robert Kennedy and the Justice Department.

nm

Ed’ Reid, author of Tha cxeonfclt Jundle and widely recognized
as one of the most respected experts on the Mafia in the
nation, has written that Carlo Marcello once threatened to
have President Kennedy and his “brother murdered. Reid has
written that he was told of Marcello's threat by an informant
who attended a secret meeting with Marcello in New Orleans in
September of 1962. ‘

HW 50955 Docld: 32423630 Page 389
is.

According to Reid's informant, Harcello told his ton
lieutenants, "Don't worry about that little Bobby
sonofabitch. He's going to be taken care of." The
informant stated that Marcello said that President
Kennedy himself would have to be killed first, and
that his brother would then follow. The informant
further stated that Marcello spoke of using Some "nut"
to do the killinas. :

Jim Draden: Author Peter Neves And Judoe Lyrne

Peter Noyes, the investigative reporter who uncovered
-most of the material regarding Jim Braden (i#uqene Brading),
is a former classmate and close friend of Judge Matthew
Byrne, Jr., the U.S. District Court Judge who presided
over the Ellsberq Pentagon Pavers trial last year.

As is now well known, Judge Byrne dismissed the case
against Ellsbheraq after he was notified that the "hite
House "Plumbers" had once burglarized the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.

A short time later, it became known that President Nixon

had twice instructed John Ehrlichman to annroach Judge
Byrne.durind the course of the Ellsberq trial and offer him
the position of Director of the FSI. This offer, which Judge
Byrne refused, has been regarded as a potential act of |
bribery ly some critics of President tixon, and is currently
under investigation by the Svecial Frocecutor's Office.

It has been widely assumed that Nixon's fervent interest’
in the outcome of the prosecution of Ellsbore may: have
been the motivation behind his approach to Judge Byrne.

Author Hoves has written of his friend Judge Byrne's

involvement in his research on Jim Braden. In 1969, after

Noyes had accumulated much of his information regarding

the mysterious Braden, he took the information to his

friend, Matt Pyrne, who was then U.S. Attorney for southern

California. Voyes had several talks with Byrne and has said

that Byrne was very impressed by the substantive evidence

which Foves had aathered. During one of thesa meetings with

Byrne and another FBI man whom Byrne had invited to attend,

the FRI man told Noyes that the FBI had never before known

that Jim Broaden =- the man arrested at. the scene of the

assassination in 1963 - was actually Yucene Erading. the

EBI man said that the Bureau must have made a big mistake

in not tracing down Braden'ts true identity and nolice record.

The FRI man was nearly incredulous over Noves' evidence on

Braden.
. .

Voyes meanwhile had discovered that Jim Praden had also beon

in Los Angeles on the night that Robert Kennedy was assassinated

in early June of 1968.

Though Noyes couldn't find any significant information indicating
any Braden connection to the second Kennedy murder, he and his
friend Hatt Byrne forwarded the information on Braden to the
Special Unit of the LAPD which was investigating the RFX death.

BW 50955 Bocld:32423630 Page 391
The Special Unit of the LAP, according to Noyes, dis-
counted the infornation reaarding the RFK assassination,
but was indeed impressed by the Braden connection to the
1963 assassination. Noyes writes that Judge Byrne never

® month later, in Decembor of 1963, Bradina became a
Charter menber of the oxclusive (and very exnensive)

La Costa Country Club in southern California. Later that
year, 1964, Brading and his old svndicate oil friend

Roger Bauman established the "DB And B’Cattle Comnany."

The company.was set uv in Chicago and was oresumably

named after then, "B And 5," though neither of the two

men are listed as corporate officers. Tt vas also during
this same period that Brading made a substantial investment
in two lots in Corel Gables, Florida

In 1965, Brading's lengthy narole’ was finally terminated,
Me soon bougdnt a new home near the La Costa Country Club
which he had joined, and he also bought a house for his
mnarents in Santa Barbara, :

And it is at the La Costa Country Club that the mysterious
trail of Jim braden, or Eugene Hale Erading, finally ends...

The La Costa Country Club, which Rrading had joined as one
of its 100 Charter members in January of 1964, is one of
the more notorious HMafia properties in the nation.

“nowerful force behind La Costa is Noe Dalitz, one
Lanskv's sinele closest associates. Moe Dalitz had
leader of the early Mayfield Road Gang in Cleveland,

and nad been the founcor of the actual Cleveland syndicate,

one of the most powerful forces in the national crime syndicate.

Hoe Dalitz had heen one of the Mafiats bigcest investors in
as Vegas, and it had been Dalitz who had personally helned

set up the Howard [lughes empire in Las Vacas. Dalitz haa
sold much of bis own holdings to Howard Iiughes in. the late
1960's.

The La Costa Country Club had become, under the direction
of Moe Dalitz and liever Lansky, a key “watering hole" of
the syndicate. La Costa was originally financed through a
syndicate deal with James Hoffa of the Teamsters. One of
the Teamsters Union's billion dollar Pension Funds was used
ain the financing of the project. La Costa became what is
known in the Hafia as “open territory” - meaning that no
single Mafia family controlled it. La Costa was open to all.

Intelligence authorities in southern California have long
regarded La Costa as a.nrime hangout for the Mafia. Some-
officials have dubbed it "Apalachin West."

The syndicate had originally qiven Charter memberships in
La Costa to a number of Hollywood celebrities, so as to
soften the image of the plush resort. Among the members
were Prank Sinatra, Bob Nope, and Bing Crosby.

Members of Prosident Nixon's inner circle also became
frequent guests as La Costa, which is just twenty miles

avay from San Clemente. Barly in the Nixon Administration,
in 1969, Los Angeles Police were astonished to find Murray
Chotiner, one of the President's closest confidantes, living
it up at La Costa while the President was in San Clemente,

In February of 1973, while President Mixon was at’ San Clen-
ente, H.R., Haldeman, John .2hrlichman, Richard Moore, and
John Dean held a serics of meetings’ at La Costa to Aaiscuss
the Watergate conspiracy, which was then beginning to
unravel.

John Dean qave lengthy testimony during the Grvin Committee
hearings regqerding "the La Costa meetings." These meetinads

at La Costa have since emerced as perhams the most crucial
strategy sessions involved in the allened cover-un of
Watergate by the President's closest aides. Dean testified
that ene Ia Costa meetings took place over a neriod of tro
Gays, February 19 - 12, 1973, Dean testified that the sessions
ware hela in a special ‘villa’ at La Costa that was used by
tlaldeman.

Tt has been during this same period of time, in the last
sever ars, that Eucene Brading (Jin Braden) has become
‘one of the most important Nafia operatives at La Costa.
According to numerous intelligence reports, from California,
Novada, and federal authorities, Brading is now sSusnected of
being the personal courier for national crime syndicate bos
Neyer Lansky ‘ .

Braden was suspected of taking over $72-million out of

that was a "low ostimate."

In the summer of 1°71, Braden came under renewed investi-
gation by California authorities following an incident at

5 lain Mobster C laimed
Cuban Link to J FK Death

. By Ronald Kessler and Laurence Stern
Washington Post Staff Writers

“His (Morgan’s) clients were aware
of the identity of some of the individ-

Long before his recent murder,
-John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld

_recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-
‘tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in retali-
‘ation, were involved in the asSassina-
_tion of President John F. Kennedy.

Rosselli’s belief in a Cuban connec-
tion to the Kennedy assassination was
‘expressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long
ago as March, 1967, and also in private -
.conversations with a longtime associ-
ate of Rosselli who participated in
‘meetings between Rosselli ‘and the
CIA. +

. An FBI “blind memorandum" on
an interview with Morgan dated
March 21, 1967, was included, without

_ identification of the interviewee, in

last June’s Senate Intelligence Com-'

mittee's report on the role of the in-
telligence community in the Kennedy
assassination investigation.

Morgan told the FBI that Rosselli
and another Morgan client had in-
formed him that, Castro became aware
of CIA assassination conspiracies

against him and “thereafter employed -

teams of individuals who were dis-
’ patched to the. United States for the ©

purpose of assassinating Mr. Ken-

nedy.”
Because neither Morgan nor Ros-

selli was identified in the Senate re-.
port, the significance of that portion ©

“of the 106-page document was dis-
counted at the. time it was published
- In June, before Rosselli’s Wisappear-

ance and the subsequent discovery of
his body in an oil drum in Florida
waters. The Washington Post, however,
has confirmed that Morgan and Rosselli
. were the sources of the testimony that
suggested a Cuban role in. the Ken-
nedy murder. .

Morgan's account, according. to a
summary of the FBI interview, ‘was
that Rosselli had reached his conelu-

sion about a Cuban connection to the’

Kennedy assassination from

“feedback” furnished by sources close ¢

to Castro who were involved inthe CIA
plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.

uals who came to the United States
for this purpose and he understood
that two such individuals were now in
the state of New. Jersey,” the FBI in-

terview summary stated. . fi

A long-time associate. of Rosselli -

who was interviewed separately © by

! The Washington Post, said there was
‘no question in the slain mobster’s
}mind that (President Kennedy was

‘killed on Castro’s behalf in reprisal

for the CIA schemes against the Cu-
ban leader: ©

“He was positive; he was sure,” said
the associate, who knew Rosselli well

_and was in contact with him before
; Rosselli disappeared from his Florida

home on July 28. The associate, who

does not want to be identified pub-

icly, is scheduled to be interviewed
: this week by Dade County, Fla., homi-
: cide detectives. He was a party to Ros-
‘selli’s contacts in the early 1960s with
“CIA case officers overseeing the at-
tempts to assassinate Castro. ~~.

Despite occasional speculation, the .

collective conclusion of all official
U.S. government investigations into
the Kennedy assassination—including

/ the Warren Commission, the FBI and

the CIA~—has been that there was no
evidence: that implicated the Castro

- government or any of its agents.
: . However, the CIA’s inyolvement in

the schemes to assassinate - Castro
_was not divulged to the Warrén Com-
mission, and knowledge of them was
confined until 1967 to a small, elite

_ circle of the U 'S. intelligence commu- *

The body of Rosselli, who lived
flamboyantly in a world of mobsters,
politicians and playgirls, was found
two weeks ago in an inverted oil drum

“gases from decomposition on the

‘of Rosselli,

‘ocean’s surface off the coast of Miami.

The specific cause of death was dete
.mined by an autopsy to be asphyxia-~
tion. /. 5

Last year, an underworld colleague
Sam (Momo) Giancana,
who also had been recruited by the
CIA in the effort to kill Castro, was
found shot to death in his Chicago
“home in what police described as a
highly professional job by assailants!

who penetrated the mobster'’s per-
‘sonal security screen. Giancana was

due to testify before the Senate Intel-
iHigence Committee shortly after his
‘demise. i

Neither murder has been solved.

The possibility that Rosselli's mur-
der might have been related to his
Senate testimony on the CIA schenies
to kill Castro has brought the FBI
into the investigation at the request
of Attorney General Edward H. Levi.

The involvement of Rosselli, Gian-
cana and other underworld figures—
principally Santos
Tampa, Fla., whose one-time Havana
gambling enterprises fell hostage in
1959 to the Cuban revolution—in plots
against Castro had been a closely held
secret within the top echelons of the
CIA and FBI until recently.

The tangled chronology of suppres
sion and eventual disclosure, although
detailed in the June report, has re-
ceived little public attention. Rossel-

li's murder adds significance to those |

events.

Here is the sequence, pieced’ to-
gether from the testimony given to
"Senate intelligence investigators:

Columnist Drew Pearson’ went to

the Jate Chief Justice of the United

States Earl Warren late in January,
1967, and told him that a Washington.-

lawyer had confided to him that one
of his clients said the United States
“had attempted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in the early 1960s and Castro
had decided to retaliate.”
Warren declined Pearson's
tion that he see the lawyer, who was
Edward Morgan. Warren referred the

matter to then Secret Service Direc-

tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,
1967, wrote FBI Director J. Edgar Ho-

over, informing him of the allegations. -

sugges- -

+ Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six
senior bureau officials on an “eyes-

-only” basis. There is no record of FBI

meetings or discussions of those aile-
gations, At that point the sensitive let-
ter bounced back and forth’in the
higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-
racy.

The job of responding to Rowley’s
letter was assigned to the supervisor
of the FBI’s General Investigative Di-
vision wha was given responsiility for
the overall assassination investigation
in March 1964.

’ This official’s job was complicated’
by the fact that he had never been in-

. formed of. what Hoover and his closest
‘circle of confidants in the FBI learned

sination of President Kennedy. This
‘bureau is not conducting,any investi-
gation regarding this matter.” The
FBI official added in later, testimony
that “everyone. inthe higher echelons

‘ read this.

Drew Pearson went ahead and pub-
lished a column on March 7, 1967, ref-
erring to reports that CIA schemes
against Castro’s life in 1963 “may
have resulted in a counterplot by Cas-
tro to assassinate President Kenne-
dy.”

Ten days tater, Marvin Watson, one
of Lyndon Johnson’s chief deputies,

. called FBI assistant director Cartha

DeLoach with the message that “the
President had instructed that the FBI
interview (Morgan) concerning any
knowledge he might. have regarding.

the assassination of . President Ken.
~nedy.” io
DeLoach told Watson that it ap-

peared Morgan “did not want to be in-
terviewed, and even if he was inter-
‘viewed he would probably not divulge
the identity of his sources . . .’ Wal-
son persisted, however. “es
“Under the eireumstances,” De-

Leach concluded in a memo for the.

files, “it appears that we have no al.
ternative: but to interview (Morgan)
and then furnish the results to: Wat:
son in blind memorandum form.” -"-*

The interview was assigned to two
agents from the FBI's General Investi-
gative Division, which the Senate

= for the purpose of asgassinating Presi

committee concluded was “puzzling”
because it was the Domestie Intelli-
gence Division which had heen as-
signed responsibility for investigating
possible foreign involvement in the
assassination.

Neither agent was privy to the
knowledge, confined to Hoover and
his top aides, of the CIA’s assassina-
tion plots against Castro. Both agents
testified eight years later that they
were “surprised” when Morgan al-
luded during the interview to U.S. at-
tempts to assassinate Castro.

“These agents stated that they
could not evaluate the lawyer's
“(Morgan’s) allegations or question him
in detail on them, since they had not
been briefed on the CIA assassination
efforts,” the Senate committee ob-
served.

_ + On March 21, 1967, the FBI's Wash-

ington Field Office sent headquarters
ten copies of a blind memorandum
summarizing the interview with Mor-
gan..

Ina Senate Intelligence Committee
summary of the FBI interview, Mor-

’ gan was reported to“ have acknowl .

edged that his clients. were “on the
fringe of the underworld” and that
they faced “possible prosecution in a
crime not related to the assassination

Morgan said his clients “were called
upon by a governmental agency to as-
sist in a project which was said to
have the highest governmental ap-
proval. The project had as its purpose
the assassination of Fidel Castro.
Elaborate plans were made, includjng

. the infiltration of the Cuban Govern-

ment and the placing of informants
within key posts in Cuba.”

Morgan also told the FBI, according
to the summary, that Castro had em-
ployed “teams ‘of individuals who
were dispatched to the United States -

‘dent Kennedy.”

It was not ‘clear then-—nor is it to
day—-why Morgan’ came forward at ~
that time to bring” Rosselli’s story to
the ears of the nation’s highest law
enforcement authorities. :

It may be relevant that Rosselli had
‘serious legal problems at the time.

In May, 1966, the FBI. threatened to
deport him for living in the United

- States under an assumed name unless

he cooperated in an’ investigation of
the Mafia (his true name was Filippo

~An inquisitive American learns many things on a
visit to Cuba. One of the most surprising is that high
officials in Havana seem genuinely hopeful that the
investigation of the Kennedy assassination will be re-
opened. They are convinced that ‘there was.a Cuban
factor in the murder. wpe : ’

‘Conversations with senior officials of the Cuban :

"government, including Deputy Prime Minister Carlos.
Rafael Rodriguez, make clear that they have followed
closely the disclosures by the Senate Intelligence
Committee casting doubt upon the Warren Commis. -
sion jnvestigation. The Cubans are well aware that the
doubts cénter on the failure of the CLA and the FBI to
inform the Warren Commission of the several plots
mounted by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro. Knowledge
of these plots appears to have been withheld even
from the FBI and CIA officials who were responsible -
tor investigating the President's murder and for. sup-
porting the work of the Warren Commission. As a re-
sult, there was no special effort to explore the possi-
ble involvement of either the Cuban government or.
Cuban exiles in the assassination. Evidence developed.
by the Senate committee makes both hypotheses plau-
sible—and a new inquiry imperative. es

adequate prop for their predilections. The comunis-,
sion did not know that on Nov. 22, 1983, at about the’
very hour Oswaid struck in Dallas, an agent of the!
Central Intelligence Agency was meeting with a rank-
ing Cuban official (codenamed AMLASH and re-;
cently identified as Rolando Cubela) to plan the mur-::
der of Castro. Simultaneously, in Cuba, a French re-,
porter, Jean Daniel, was spending the day with Cas-
tro, conveying to the Cuban leader views expressed”

on two tracks but in opposite directions, and move-:

ment on either track could have provoked violent re-

_ Sponse by one or another Cuban faction. oo

Perceptions inside the Cuban government re-
sponded to both tendencies in U.S. policy. There is
good reason to suspect that the AMLASH operation
involved a double agent, or at least a singularly inept

one. Castro almost certainly knew of it. The CIA even- |
tually concluded that the AMLASH activity was “inse- |
cure” and terminated it. Among other discoveries,
within two days of the assassination it was known (but
hot to the Warren Commission) that AMLASH had-
been in contact with Soviet personnel in Mexico City, ;
where Oswald had gone in September 1963 to visit’
hoth the Cuban and Soviet consulates. Whether these_.
facts are significant or merely coincidental, one can-
not tell. In retrospect, Cuban authorities note with
‘soine relief that Oswald was denied permission to visit

', Cuba, implying that, had his request been granted;

‘the finger of suspicion would surely have pointed at.

Perhaps more suggestive of a direct leak from AM:

were based in Havana at the time and their contact
with Castro was quite limited. Evidently, the Cuban

through Harker. He charged. that the United States

‘leaders that “if they are aiding terrorist plans to elimi-

This threat of reprisals seems less inflammatory
_and more understandable now that we know what

Then and now the Cubans’ attitude toward Ken-

Could Rosselli Have Linked
Castro Plot to JFK Death? |

By RON LaBRECQUE
- Harald Stott Writer

In 1960, when the CIA was try-

‘ing to set up a delicate attempt on
.the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to

a man once described as “the big-

“gest flag-waving SOB in the coun-
‘ury” = West Coast underworld
‘figure Johnny Rosselli.

Rosselli — a seemingly improba-

-ble conspirator in a government

“plot — got the ‘flag-waving” label
-from Salvatore (Momo) Giancdna,

‘then Chicago’s top crime boss and

aman Rosselli brought into that

“same plot.

Now both are dead, murdered in
the past year, and investigators are
wondering whether their plotting
led to their deaths and whether the
CIA plots against Castro — only
recentiy made public and even kept
from the Warren Commission —
are vitai clues to the John
nedy assassination.

The aeaths of Giancana, in June
of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer,
have aroused a renewed concern in

Washington, where on Friday the

House of Representives voted to re-
open the investigation of the Ken-
nedy murder.

REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D.,
Va.), who will be chairman of the,
Panel, said he is “convinced’:a con--
spiracy was invoived-in Kennedy's:
death.

Now, in the aftermath of the vi-,
olent deaths of Giancana and Ros-'
selli, the question arises of what
‘role, if -any, the. Kennedy White
House played in the early 1960s
“deal” the CIA made with the two
underworld figures to have Castro”
‘murdered.

Whether “the Kennedy * + White’
House knew ‘about about the. CIA’s

plotting (Robert F. Kennedy found -

out after the contacts were ended),
the CIA's use of the underworld

F. Ken-

‘Seems ironic in retrospect.

+ Robert Kennedy's passionate ef-

forts to disable organized crime are

“well documented,

IN 1960 when Robert Kennedy

wrote about what he had learned
of organized crime in America
from his years as chief counsel to.
the Senate Rackets Committee, he

-too quoted Giancana to make a

point.

He told about Giancana's inter-

view at his local draft board at the
outbreak of World War Hl, when
he was asked what he did for a liv-
in
: ey steal,” Giancana is said to
have replied.
: So Sam Giancana didn’t go to
‘war and years later would boast to
Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that
‘he stayed out of the Army — la-
‘beled unfit — by telling the truth.

‘| “What's wrong with the syndi-

“cate?” Kennedy, ‘quoted Giancana.
“Two or three of us get together
‘on a business deal and everybody
says it’s a bad thing. Businessmen
,do it all the time and nobody
isquawks.""

; A Senate committee began stu:
laying the Kennedy questions more
‘than a year ago as it looked at co-
ivert CIA activities.

IN AN addendum to the Senate
‘Intelligence Committee’s interim
weport last November, Sen. Howard
(Baker (R., Tenn.) said, “it is my
‘personal view that on baiance the
‘likelihood that presidents (the re-

port deait with Dwight Eisenhower”

and Kennedy) knew of the (Castro)

_ assassination plots is greater than

the likelihood that they did not.”

- dust to trace Rosselli's history

awith the CIA is mind-boggling for
‘the investightors. Yet, it is just one
‘aspect of the search for his killer.
* Johnny Rosselli —- born on the
fourth of July in Esperia, Italy, and
‘71 when he died — was not first
and foremost a CIA operative.

His greater role'as evidenced by .
two convictions, his associations
and to some extent his own com-
ments, was as an influential, if
publicly lesser known, organized.
grime figure. .
te HIS ASSOCIATION with other -
identified underworld members -
was monitored by law enforcement
agencies as recently as several.
weeks - before ‘his July 28 disap-
pearance.

By all accounts, Rosselli was a-:
‘charming man, dressing in expen- -
‘sive clothes, married for only two‘
fyears in the early 1940s and
iknown most of his life as one who -
leasify’ attracted women.

+ He wag an ‘immigrant who told‘,
lin a short autubiography written ~
‘about 1967 that his “life of crime” ;

pnd Stealing $50 on his own. As new:

aveled west, finally to settle in.
ICalitornia, his attention turned to:
bootlegging, gambling and dab~
bling in the movie business.

; IT IS said that Rosselli’ guarded .
jthe West Coast gambling interests |

for Giancana’s Chicago syndicate.

Why Rosselli was chosen by the
‘CIA for a Castro plot in 1960 is un-
clear, although CIA officials have
‘since testified that they wanted the

‘ganized crime had made during the

/ The unraveling of CIA and un- ‘
derworld conspiracies, an awesome .,
web spanning decades, is left to a
1eain of nine in the, Metro Homicide

lived in Plantation, Broward Coun-
ty. with his sister and brother-in-
law. It's just that his killers chose
to dump his body in Dade.

their instincts lead them to con-
clude that the Rosselli murder was ©
an internal underworld affair, all °
on the team are aware of the pres- |
sure on them to search each clue ~
that leads back te the CIA-Castro
affair.

. With Rosselli’s death this sum-
mer, the newly appointed Senate
; committee saw its list of knowl-
edgeable witnesses further trim-
med. Some of those witnesses have
died violently and some from natu-
~ ral causes. .
-: When Giancana was murdered in
June of 1975, before he could even
be questioned by the committee
staff, authorities attributed it to an
internal gangland struggle — even
though. the murderer is still un-
known. |

The death of Rosselli, who had
appeared before the committee
three times in the past year with-
out immunity, caused greater con-

cern on Capitol Hill, -

THE SAME night Rosselli's body
was identified — the legs hacked
off and stuffed along with the body
into an oil drum — Baker, vice
chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, called for the FBI to
‘get involved in the case. (Several
days later, Attorney General Ed-
ward Levi ordered FBI involve-
ment.) a :

It wasn't until several weeks
later, however, that what was
known to Baker became public
knowledge. :

A section of the former commit-
tee’s April report told of a Wash-
ington attorney who in 1967 went.
to Supreme Court Chief Justice
Earl Warren (chairman of the:
then-disbanded Warren Commis- .
sion) to say that two’of his clients .
believed they knew about Cuban
agents in the United States who.

. came public, .

“There was never the slightest
doubt in John's mind that Castro

was responsible for the assassina--

tion of Kennedy,” said Edward P.

Morgan, the attorney referred to in

the report.
Morgan is an attorney of no
mean stature in Washington. He
“! served as chief counsel to the joint
congressional " committee — which
studied the Pearl Harbor attack,
counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and for seven
years was .chief inspector of the
FBI. .

ROSSELLI told Morgan about

the CIA plot in 1967, when the De-

partment of Justice was vigorously
attempting to deport Rosselli for
being an illegal alien.

Rosselli, Morgan said, “was cer- .
tain that the people he (Rosselli).

put around Castro in the CIA plot
turned right around and killed Ken-
nedy. The people he still knew (in
1967) did it.”

Rosselli, according to Morgan,,
decided to talk about his CIA activ- ;

ity in hopes of decreasing the pres«

. Sure from the FBI and Department .

of Naturalization and Immigration,.
both Justice Department agencies.
Several friends of Rosselli, in-

cluding Morgan, say they are con- .

vinced the FBI tried to get Rosselli
to become’ an organized crime. in-

formant by threatening to have:
him deported if he didn’t coopera-.

te. ;
IN 1961, through a bungled,

. Wiretap” effort, the FBI* became:
aware of Rosselli's CIA activities. ~
- While Giancana ‘and Rosselli:
were in Florida planning the opera-
tion, Giancana wanted to return to
Las Vegas to check on his girl
friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he
suspected of dating comedian Dan
Rowan. To keep Giancana in Flori-
da, it was agreed that a bug would
be placed in her hotel room and her
conversations monitored.
But the private detective they
hired, with CIA money. it has since
been learned, was discovered and

arrested. Eventually the police in- :
vestigation led back to the Castro.
_ plotters. .

Prosecution was avoided when
the CIA intervened and said the
“national interest” would be dam-
aged if the plot information be-

WHEN THE wiretap case was
again to be investigated in 1966,
this time by a Senate committee
headed by the late Sen. Edward
Long (D., Mo.), the CIA again step-
ped in to stop it.

Morgan was told about the pend-
ing investigation by Rosselli and
Robert Mahue, a former FBI
agent-turned Howard Hughes aide
who was the CIA’s. initial link to

- Rosselli. :

Mahue told Morgan that both he
and Rosselli had been subpenaed to.
appear before the committee. Mor-:
gan said he called Lawrence Hous-:
ton, the CIA general counsel. Hous-
ton went to Long and the investi-.
gation was dropped.

. MORGAN SAID he knew, as the:
Senate committee recently empha--
sized as well, that all information
- about the CIA plots — which could
have been the incentive for pro-*
Castro forces to kill Kennedy —-
had been kept from the Warren:
‘Commission.

“Iwas an admirer of Earl War--
ren,” Morgan said. “(His) report:
said that ... Oswald alone killed,
Kennedy. It kept bugging me after -
sO gruesome a detail from Rosselli
that the Chief Justice could put his
name on a report which didn't as-
sess the ‘most significant piece of
evidence bearing on the killing of
Kennedy.” - : ; :

The information Morgan had
‘was passed to Warren via colum-

nist Drew Pearson, a mutual
friend. Eventually, it reached the
FBI, but, remarkably, even after di-
rect orders from President Lyndon
Johnson in the spring of 1967, in-
vestigation was not vigorously pur-
sued... - . .

THE SENATE Intelligence Com-_
mittee compared that apparent. in-
action with a statement former FBI
director J. Edgar Hoover made to

. the Warren Commission on May 5,.
1964. Hoover said, “well, I can as-
~ sure. you so far as the FBI is con-.

cerned the case will be continued:
in an open classification for. all-
“time. That is, any information com-
ing to us or any report coming to:
‘us from any source will' be thor--
oughly investigated, so that we
Ywill be “able"to prove or disprove!
? the allegation.” , ¥
’__ A Senate Committee staff mem»
ber commented recently, “what is
‘really happening is that the investi-
gation which the FBI should have
done in 1967 — and no one can
come close to explaining why it
wasn't-— is actually being done
now.” .
HART, AS have local investiga~
. tors, has established three possible
. Scenario’s for Rosselli’s death: his
recent organized crime activity, re-
taliation for his Castro assassina-
tion efforts or the information he
held concerning the JFK assassina-
tion.
HW 50955 DocId: 32423630

“Maybe Roesélli's ~ information

was the vital nerve of the Kennedy”

assassination,” a Senate source. told .
The Herald. °
High officials in the Cuban gov- |
ernment also reportedly feel there -
- was a “Cuban factor’sin the JFK
: death, but they see it as a result of

' exile politics, according to a recent
article by Alton Frye, a senior fel-,
low of the Council Foreign Rela-:

tions in Washington.
._ Frye wrote that he visited Ha-
vana recently and met with Cuban,
; Officials including Deputy Prime
. Minister Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.
“.,. they volunteer the suspicion
that the recent murders of Sam Gi-
“ancana and Johnny Rosselli ...
surely have some connection with
} Cuban exile politics and the 'Kenne-
dy murder,” Frye wrote. .

THERE HAVE been theories re-
cently propounded to show why
both pro and anti-Castro forces
could have wanted to get JFK out
- of power in 1963.

On the one hand, there is the re-

‘ port of French journalist Jean Dan- .

_ del, who was the bearer to Castro
of an offer from.JFK for calmer re-

» dations. Castro was reportedly -

agreeable, The report stated that .:
fDaniel ‘later was’ Junching with. |
, Castro when word came that Ken-_

; nedy had been shot. Daniel de-
scribed the Cuban leader as genu-
inely shocked by the news.

It has since been learned that
probably in the very hour JFK was
shot, a one-time Castro supporter
was receiving a poison pen device
from a CIA agent in what was a
long-running anti-Castro effort.
That Cuban agent was code-named -
AM/LASH, and he has since been
identified as Rolando Cuebala, now
imprisoned in Cuba for his assassi- °

: nation Plotting.

WHETHER JFK had knowledge
of, or perhaps even approved, any:
, of the assassination piots will .prob-:
ably never be known.
His closest advisers, who testi-_
‘fied before the Senate Committee,”
‘all said he had no knowledge of
such plots and would never have
+ approved of them.

‘The same month Rosselli was.

. passing poison pills to his Cuban
contact at a meeting at the Fon-
? tainebleau, March of 1961, former
Florida Sen. George Smathers, a
friend of Kennedy, said he and

Page 406

Kennedy discussed the ramifica-’

tions of a Castro assassination.

Smathers has since said Kennedy
rejected the idea and that the dis-
cussion was more of a “brain-pick-
ing” session.

AT LEAST one high-level CIA
official did testify he believed the

White House was being briefed on-

the plots but according to Richard
Bissell, one of the officials who
originally decided to use Rosselli, it
was through the method of “plau-
sible deniability.”

That, according to the recent
Senate report, “can also lead to the
use of euphemism and circumlocu-’
tion, which are designed to allow
the President and other senior offi-
cials to deny knowledge of an op-
eration should it be disclosed.”

Another alleged link between!
the White House and the under-

‘world plotters, first made public by

the Senate Committee, has also
been denied by virtually everyone
involved. Judith Campbell Exner,
the woman who claims to have
been friend and lover to both Gian-

‘cana and JFK, introduced to both
by Frank Sinatra, was not a link in_
the Castro plotting, those close’ to *
both Giancana and Kennedy have °
said. ,

A MAN with acéess to Kenne-~
dy's closest advisers told The Her-
ald recently, “The Giancana-Ros-
selli thing is unrelated to the Exner
thing. I was there. Sure JFK knew
her, but he was naive about those
kinds of things.”

There is documentation to show
that om March 22, 1962, Hoover.

_lunched privately with Kennedy

and presumably gave him his first
information linking Exner with the

gangsters. The final’ recorded <
, phone call between the White -
: House and Exner was made only ai
few hours later. ; ‘

Another possible tink discussed

: in the Senate report shows that the !
same unidentified Cuban to whom ;
Rosselli passed the poison pills.’
prior to the Bay of Pigs operation ©

in April of 1961, was among a

group of Cuban exile leaders who :
met with JFK following the inva- ;

sion fiasco.

Cubans - with whom _ Rosselli
worked have been identified, but
investigators say that not ali are
known.

The decline of John Rosselli ap-.

1967, he was convicted jn a card--
cheating scandal at the posh, celeb- |
rity-filled Friar’s Club in: Los An- .
geles where the influence of Sina-
tra had made him a member ac-;:
cording to investigators. °

Deportation pressures were aiso
mounting at this time.

” ROSSELLI entered prison on the
conviction in 1970 where he would:
serve three years of a five-year,
sentence. - .

In 1971; he was brought td a.
federal grand jury in Los Angeles
which was probing whether some

indentified Detroit organized crime :

leaders conspired with the Emprise:

wide race track and sporting event}
concessions — ‘to: hide financial in-;

Rosselli, too, had, an interest in
the Frontier, which opened i in 1967.
He owned the gift shop concession®
along, with a partner named Joe:
Breen. How Rosselli obtained the
concession is unclear, but” Breen.
said it gave Rosselli an‘ income of
about $60,000.

ROSSELLI at one time hdd been:

a major influence in Las Vegas.

Several sources sajd that when the
owners of the Desert Inn wanted |
Howard Hughes to move out of the
penthouse — because. his special
needs were costly and ‘putting
NW 50955 DocId: 32423630 Page 407

some “high rollers” in would, be
more profitable — it was Rosselli
-who patched things up.

Hughes eventually bought the
Desert Inn, as well as the Frontier.

What Rosselli told the federal
grand “jury about the Frontier, in
i971 is unknown.. Rosselli didn’t

testify fater at the trial at which:

Anthony J, Zerilli and Michael Pol-

izzi and the Emprise.Corp., among -

“others, were convicted.

ZERILLI and Polizzi are still in

jail. In 1973, the House of Repre-
sentatives Select Committee on
Crime probed | the influence of or-
ganized crime in sports — and one
area they looked at was Emprise
and the Frontier Hotel case.

At the time.of the conviction, the
federal prosecutor asked that Poliz-
zi and Terilli be jailed immediately,
because monitored, wiretapped
conversations showed that the two
had talked about “murder,- the kill-
ing of certain individuals.”

An intimate associate of Rosselli,
however, discounts the possibility
that Rosselli’s grand jury appear-
ance could have led to his death.
“They know Johnny didn't talk to
the grand jury,” the associate said.

JOE BREEN said “Rosselli hadn’t
been to Las Vegas for nine years,
that “he’s never even seen the gift
shop.”

Since his prison release and
move to Plantation, Rosselli wasn’t
trying to regain power; according
to his friends. “He had no muscle,”
said an associate.“I can’t believe
Rosselli was getting back into’ mob
stuff.”

But at the same time, ‘many of
the associates were surpised to
learn about Rosselli's recent visits
with alleged organized ¢rime fig-
ures on the West Coast.

Several associates speculate that
Rosselli. wanted to get involved in

. casino gambling, preferably in the
“Middle East, and was looking for
someone with money to back him..

“MY IMPRESSION was that he
was broke,” Morgan said. “He told
me last year, ‘Tm. in. bad. financial.
straits. aa :

Scheer said Rosselli’s income in-
cluded about $60,000 from the gift
_shop and about $3,500 in social se-
curity, most of which went for
back fees to attorneys and for gov-
_ernment fines.

——

One friend said! that just before
Giancana’s death, |Rosselli had ac-
cepted Giancana’s|offer of money.
The friend was tojact as-the inter-
mediary. “Let me/figure out what
my next (attorney's) tab will-be,”
the friend. quoted! Rosselli as |
ing. . ‘ i

Rosselli is described as a man
with a sense of humor who did lit-"
tle offending.

A California woman who had
known Rosselli for about 40 years

_told ‘The Herald,! “If you’ were.

around him for 30 minutes you'd
like him because he would regard
you as a human being.”

“If you had a headache he would”
either get you an laspirin or send
someone to get one. I said: some-
thing significant there — he would
get it or he would gend someone —

“he wasn't a pansy, but he wasn’t a

tough guy either.”

ON THE ASSASSINATION OF "~~ l-Mr. Malley /¢ 7 _..
PRESIDENT KENNEDY 1-Mr. Shroder . ky

PURPOSE:

a . & eo ae
To advise you that an Agent of the Secret Service, when om
testifying before the President's Commission, denied making certain :
statements to FBI Agents which were subsequently reported to the
Commission. « : :

«

DETAILS: t aa

° 2 In Volume XI of the hearings before the President's
-' CommisSion commencing on page Gl there appears the testimony :
of Roy H. Kellerman, Assistant Special Agent’, White House Detail, ad
U. 1S. Secret “Service on 3-9-G64, - *In Charge '
. ~~ Under questioning by a Commission member, Kellerman
was asked about certain statements reportedly made by him on i
11-22-63, to SA's Francis %. O Neill, Jr. and James WJ. Sibert, i
of our Baltimore Office, which appear in the 12-10-63 Dallas
report of Special Agent Robert P. Gemberling (page 3, paragraph or
4). SA's O'Neill and Sibert were under orders to be observers
during the autopsy of president Kennedy at the National Naval _{
_-Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, which commenced on the ~ ;™
evening of 11-22-63, to be of assistance to the Secret Service,
and to look after the Bureau's interests.

- A, fosen te Mr. Belmont Hemo
RE: PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION

: The Commission in questioning Kellerman made specific : tee
‘reference to the underscored portions of the above paragraph
. as it contradicts some of Kellerman's testimony. Kellerman et

claims he did not.hear the President. nor Mrs. Kennedy say
these things and had never told our Agents that he had. In
part of Kellerman's denial he stated "I don't know where they
+got those quotes,"

OBSERVATIONS:.

Kellerman is claiming oux Agents furnished inaccurate ra
accounts of a conversation with him. It is to be remembered
that at the time this conversation with our Agents reportedly

took place 11-22-63, Kellerman had been a security guard in
the Presidamt's car and more than likely was upset and feeling
remorse over the days episode, In his testimony before the
Commission hetendeavored to give the impression that he’ acted.
* calmly and immediately took command, issuing logical instructions |
after the Presiddat was hit. The conversation reported by. Bia -
“—~ our Agents made it appear Kellerman reacted normally to the L..
tragedy and not dramatically as indicated in his testimony, -
as he didn't order the driver tothe hospital until after the _—
: President had so directed. 4

‘tt is felt our Agents reported accurately what
Kellerman told them on 11-22463, and that Kellerman's testimony
33 months later is the result of considered deliberation, on
his part, to paint the most favorable picture possible, under | 1
the circumstances, for the Secret Service. j

Consideration has been given to discussing this matter | ==
with Chief Rowley of Secret Service, however, since it is the :
word of our Agonts against Kellerman’ s, it is not felt any good
purpose would be served by this course of action.

RECOMMENDATION: ‘

Affidavits are being obtained from our Agents Sibert
and O'N@tl1l attesting to the accuracy of their report and
refuting Kellerman se that we will be in a position to show
any future inquirer that we recognized this contradiction and
did ees about it.

1. The following CIA Staff Employees, all of whom
are now retired, participated in the preparation of DIR
86054 on 30 November 1963: .

Originator: Mr. Louis Armstrong

Coordinators: Mr. John M. Whitten, Mr. William
. _B. Tyng, Ms. Sue L. Darling

Authenticator: Mr. William B. Tyng ("for"
Desmond FitzGerald)

Releasor: Mr. John M. Whitten ("for’ J.C. King)

: 2. We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana
flight No. 465 on 22 November 1963 from Mexico City to Havana,
Cuba, was Mario MAURI who was accompanied by his wife, Maria
Antonieta MAURI. We have been unable to determine who trans-
mitted the ‘information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we

-have not been able to locate any documents relating to this
matter in Latin America Division files or the Oswald files.

3. We have been unable to locate any documents which
would indicate that there was a response to DIR 86054 from
Mexico City. :

4. Assuming there was no -response to DIR 86054, the
originating Headquarters componeng should have initiated
follow-up action if a response was not received.

5. We have been unable to find any further information
relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.

The ‘a

By Jack Anderson
and Les Whitten
The FBE withheld from the

Warren Commission hundreds
of documents about the

assassination’ of President .,

Kennedy. © :
“These are raw FBI files,
which the commission

requested but never received,
They contain no startling
information that will overturn
the commission's verdict, but
they reveal intimately how the
FBI handied its most im-
portant case. .

In the margins of some
suppressed memos, the late
FBI chief, J. Edgar Hoover,
scribbled caustic comments in
blue ink. He was critical of
almost everyone involved in
the investigation, from Dallas
police chief Jesse Curry to

. President Lyndon Johnson.

Confidential notes kept by
sone top FBI official, for
‘example, quote Hoover as
warning: ‘‘Johnson may
become very dictatorial. We
{must keep our guard up.”

- 3 Sources familiar with the
' suppressed documents say the
contents were summarized
and submitted to the Warren
Commission. But there were
some subtle, perhaps
deliberate, omissions,

The documents show that
Hoover brought pressure on
his subordinates to rush out a
preliminary report on the FBI
investigation before the
murdered President’s
brother, Robert F. Kennedy,
returned to his desk as
Atlorney General.

‘LS TEST 1427 pf Be

’. As a former defector, he also

ungten Merry-Go-Round

The confidential notes queie
floover as instructing
subordinates to get the report

{out of the Justice Deparimicat

“before Bobby gets back.” -
Apparently, the FBI chief

also feared Deputy Attorney -

General Nicholas deB. Kat-
zenbach might, tamper with
the report before forwarding it
to the’ Warren Commission.
Hoover told his aides to alert
President Johnson's major-
domo, Waiter Jenkins.

“Let Jenkins know after
report is out of our hands,”
Hoover directed. ‘Let Jenkins
know what Katzenbach is
doing, Might cause long delay.
Must not consider any
alteration.” °

Thirteen days after
President Kennedy was
gunned down in Dallas,
Hoover delivered a detailed
report to Katzenbach naming
Lee Harvey Oswald as the.
assassin. Katzenbach kept it
four days before submitting it
to the commission.

The crusty old G-man was
furious at the Dallas police
chief, meanwhile, for leaking
the story that the FBI had
investigated. Oswald but had
failed to alert the Secret
Service. .

“This is the lowest level in
history of Bureau since I have
been director," Hoover
lamented, according to the
confidential notes.

He contended that Oswald
had never been seen with
firearms, had written no hate
letters against U.S, leaders.

knew he was a marked man
whom the FBI was watching.
“With that background,”

Page 447

zruinbled Hoover, “how could
he be security risk? No in-
dication of violence so far as

our records show. . . Oswald
could have hollered false
arrest if we had arrested
him." :

The FBI chief commented
that: Chief Justice Earl
Warren, who headed the
commission, ‘would have
been first one to holler” about
Oswald's rights. Citing the
criticism of the FBI, Hoover
commented: “This is one of

the rough ones.”
He felt, therefore, that
President Johnson should

have endorsed the FBI report.
“President should: have
backed up report,” com-
plained Muvver, “based on
eviderze gathered by the
FRi” °

in private remarks that .

were never intended to be
repeated outside his inner
circle, he made deprecating
remarks not

Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-
Ariz.), who was then
preparing to run against LBJ
for the presidency.
“Goldwater has no sound
advisers around him,” Hoover
noled. But his comment on

Johnson was more deadly:

“LBJ's speeches are dull.”
The ‘Warren Commission
adopted a resolution,
meanwhile, calling for -“the
Taw materials upon which any
reports given to the com-
mission are based, together

only about .
’ President Johnson but about

- and

BI Withheld Deta on JFK Slaying

with all raw materials and
reports relating to the work of
the commission since the date
of any and all earlier reports."
¥, Lee Rankin, the general
counsel, followed up with a:
Dear Edgar” letter to. the »
FBI chief requesting the full ‘
files “as promptly as.
possible.” But’ they were ‘
never delivered. ' :
A commission lawyer, -
remembering those days ;
more than a decade ago, ,
told us: “Nobody ever got the -
FBI's own files.” In 1963-64, «
another staff member pointed
out, the FBI “could do no-

“wrong,” So no one pressed too

hard for
records. .

Now 12 -years after the °
‘Kennedy assassination, a,
fascinating story is still locked , |
in FBI files awaiting a public:
reopening. We will tell part of
the story in future columns.
Sen. Richard Schweikér (R- an
Pa.), chairman of the Benate , ;
intelligence subcomthittee .
investigating | ‘the 4;
assassination, is seeking the
full story from the FBI.

Footnote: FBI spokesmen

their internal .

- stoutly defended the FBI's
~ findings and the thoroughness

of the investigation. They
conceded that “informative” -
“deliberative” memos
were not given to the com
mission. But “everything they
needed was given them. They
had all they wanted to make
their findings."’

He became fascinated, say our

CIA Withheld Data in JFK Probe

After President John F. Kennedy
was struck down on Nov. 22, 1963, the
Central Intelligence Agency received
evidence suggesting that Cuban Pre-
mier Fidel Castro arranged the assassi-
nation in retaliation for. attempts on
his life.

Yet sources privy to the secret dis-
cussions at the highest levels of the
CIA during those hectic days now tell
us that the CIA deliberately withheld|
the evidence from the Warren Com-
mission investigating Kennedy’s death.

Our sources cite two reasons for
holding back this evidence. One was a
resolve to cover up the secret that the

’ CIA had enlisted Mafia mobsters to kill
Castro.

There also was a legitimate concern
that the Castro revelations might in-
flame the American people, whose
grief could have turned into a terrible
wrath that might have precipitated
some rash action.

Only a few key people knew. about
the CIA plot to assassinate Castro. One
was Attorney General Robert F. Ken-
nedy, who was his brother's personal
watchdog over the CIA. It has now
been established that Robert Kennedy

, was briefed on May 7, 1962, about the

attempt to use underworld killers to
knock off Castro.

Two days later, Robert Kennedy cau-
tioned the CIA not to go ahead with
the assassination without consulting
him. Since Robert Kennedy rode herd
on the CIA, it must be assumed that he

‘| --was kept advised of subsequent assassi-

nation attempts. However, there is no
documentary evidence of this.

Records now available show that
Robert Kennedy informed FBI chief J.
Edgar Hoover of the piot on May 10,

. DROPOUTS

1962. Yet neither Kennedy nor Hoover
later divulged this important informa-
tion to the Warren Commission.

Of course, various CIA officials also ~
knew about the assassination scheme. |

Not the least of them was the late CIA
chief Allen W. Dulles, who approved
the original plan. He later served on
the Warren Commmission, yet he sat

silently throughout the investigation -
. without mentioning the Cuban angle.

Within hours of President Kenne-
dy’s death, the U.S. embassy cabled in-

formation from Mexico City suggest-

ing that the Cubans may have been be-
hind the assassination. Our sources say
that the CIA developed similar infor-
mation in Washington.

The first person to reach Robert
Kennedy's side after the shooting was
CIA Director John A. McCone, who re-
mained alone with the Attorney Gen-
eral at his McLean, Va. home for
nearly three hours.

McCone swore to us that Castro's
name was never mentioned during the
three hours. But CIA records show
that the next day. McCone not only
mentioned Castro to the new Presi-
dent, Lyndon B. Johnson, but briefed
him on the information from Mexico

connection to the attention of the War-

Mafia mobster John Roselli may
have taken the secret of the John F.
Kennedy assassination with him to his
death. He was brutally murdered a
few weeks ago, his backed-up body
Stuffed into an oil drum and dumped
into Miami's Biscayne Bay.

Before he died, Roselli hinted to as-
sociates that he knew who had ar-
ranged President Kennedy's murder.
It was the same conspirators, he sug-
gested, whom he had recruited earlier
to kill Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.

By Roselli's cryptic account, Castro

"learned the identity of the underworld
contacts in Havana who had been
trying to knock him off. He believed,

“not altogether without basis, that Pres-

“ident Kennedy was behind the plot.

The Cuban leader, as the supreme
irony, decided to turn the tables and

nedy’s assassination, according to

Roselli's scenario. To save their skins,

- the plotters lined up Lee Harvey Os-
wald to pull the trigger.

Roselli could never be pinned down

cult to assess whether he knew what
he was talking about or whether he

‘are the fascinating highlights.

They were under the loose control
of Florida's Mafia chieftan,- Santos
Trafficante. His gambling enterprises
in Havana had been closed down by
Castro after the 1959 revolution. In
fact, Trafficante had been lodged fora
period in a Cuban jail, an indignity
that didn’t endear Castrotohim,

After Trafficante made it back to his
. Florida haunts, he left part of his or-
ganization behind in Havana. Some of
his henchmen even managed to de-
velop contacts in Castro's inner circie.
These Were the people Roselli wanted
to use to knock off Castro.

But Roselli didn't have the stature
inside the Mafia to make the necessary
arrangements with Trafficante. So
Roselli, called in his patron, the Chi-
cago godfather Sam (Momo) Giancana,
to deal with Trafficante.

As Roselli’s associates tell it, he per-
suaded!Giancana that it would be to
their advantage to win the good will of
the CIA. Convinced, Giancana flew
down to Florida to make the prelimi-
hary arrangements. -

Once Giancana and Trafficante set it
up, Roselli used the Havana under-
world to plot Castro's demise. At first,
they tried to plant poison pills, sup-
plied by: the CIA, in Castro’s food. The
pills would have made it. appear that
he died- of natural causes. When this
failed, snipers were dispatched to a
Havana rooftop. They were caught. .

The word reached Roselli that some
of the plotters had been tortured and
that Castro had learned about the
whole operation. ;
. The CLA called off the Roselli Opera-
tion in March, 1963, but recruited a
Castro associate, Rolando Cubela, to
murder Castro, . .

The plot to kill Cuban dic-
tator Fidel Castro, hidden for
10 years from the publle, raises
some ugly questions that high
officials would rather keep
buried deep inside the Central
Intelligence Agency.

1. Has the CIA tried to as-
sassinate any other leaders?
John McCone, who headed the
CIA during the six attempts
to knock off Castro, denied
emphatically that the CIA has
tried to kill anyone. But ex-
Sen. George Smathers, one of
John F. Kennedy's closest
friends, told us the late Presi-
dent suspected that the CIA
had arranged the shootings of
‘the Dominican Republic's Ra-
fael Trujillo in 1961 and South
‘Vietnam's Ngo Dinh Diem in
11963,

: 2. Did President Kennedy
personally. sanction the plot
jagainst Castro? The prepara-
‘rations to assassinate the Cu-
‘ban dictator began during the
:last months of the Eisenhower
‘administration as part of the

Bay of Pigs scheme. All six

attempts, however, were made
“during 1961-63 when Me. Ken-

nedy occupied the White

House. Smathers told us he
;once spoke to the late Presi
“;dent about assassinating Cas-
‘tro. Mr, Kennedy merely

‘rolled back his eyes, recalled

Smathers, as if to indicate the

‘idea was too wild to discuss.
Subsequently, Mr. Kennedy
told Smathers of his suspicion
that the CIA may have been

assassinations. .

3. Did the late Robert Ken-
nedy know about the assassina-
tion attempts? After the Bay
of Pigs fiasco, President Ker-
nedy swore to friends he

would like “to splinter the CIA

ter it-to the winds.” He put
his brother, Robert, in charge
of the CIA with instructions
to shake it up. The CIA made
five attempts on Castro’d life
after the Bay of Pigs while
Robert Kennedy waa riding
herd on. the agency. .
4. Could the plot against
Castro have backfired against
President Kennedy? The late
President was murdered nine
months after the last assassi-
nation team was caught on a
Havana rooftop with high-
powered rifles. Presumably,
they were subjected to fiend-
ish tortures until they told all
they knew. None of the assas-
sination teams, however, had
direct knowledge of the CIA
involvement. The CIA  instl-
gators had represented them-
selves as oilmen seeking re-
venge against Castro for his
seizure of oil héldings.

PLOT BACKFIRE?

Former associates recall
that Robert Kennedy, deep-
ly despondent, went into semi-
seclusion after, his brother's
assassination. Could he have
been tormented by more than
natural grief? He certainly
learned that the assassin, Lee
Harvey Oswald, had been ac-
tive in the pro-Castro move-

ment and had traveled to
Mexico to visit the Cuban
Embassy a few weeks before
the dreadful day In Dallas.
Could Bob Kennedy have
been plagued by the terrible
thought that the CIA plot,
which he must at least have
condoned, put. into motion
forces that may have brought
about -bis brother's martyr
dom? wow :

The last surviving brother,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass),
could give us no insight. His
brothers had never spoken to
him .about any asgassination
attempts against Castro, he
said. He was aware, he volun-
teered, only that Sen. Smath-
ers had talked to the late
President about eliminating
Castro. .

Smathers told us that Prest-
dent Kennedy seemed “horri-
fled” at the |dpa ‘of political
arasintond ‘| ‘remember
him saying,’ recalled Smath-
ers, “that the CIA frequently
did things’ he di@n't know
about, and he was unhappy
about It. He complained that
the CIA was almost autono-
mous.

“He told me he believed the
CIA had arranged to have
Diem and Trujillo bumped off.
He was pretty weil shocked
about that. He thought it was
a stupid thing to do, and he
wanted to get control of what
the CIA was doing.”

But McCone, disagreeing
vigorously, told us that “no
plot was authorized or impie-
mented” to assassinate Castro,
Trujillo, Diem or anyone else.

“During those days of ten-

sion, there was a wide spec.
trum of plans ranging from
one extreme to another,”
McCone admitted. “Whenever
this subject (assassinating Cas-
tro) was brought up—and-{t
was — it was rejected imme-
diately on two grounds. Firat,
it would not be condoned: By
anybody. Second, It wouldn't
have achleved anything.”
There was also talk in high
places, McCone acknowledged,
of supporting a coup to oust
Diem. The former CIA di-
rector sald he had argued
against ¢his at a secret session
with both Kennedy brothers.
He bad contended that there
was no one strong enough. to
take Diem’s place and that a
coup, therefore, would bring
“political upheaval.” .
“{ told the President and.
Bobby together,” recalied Mc.
Cone, “that if I were running
a baseball team and had only
one pitcher, I wouldn't take
him out of the game.” os
The November, 1963, coup
caught the United States com-
pletely by surprise, he sald.
While the plotters were mov-
ing on the palace, he said,
then-Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge was visiting Diem.
Adm. Ulysses Sharp, then our
Paclfie commander, had also
been present, but had left
early to ge to the airport.
McCone said President ©
Diem escaped through a tun-
nel but was caught in nearby
Cholon and “shot in a station
wagon.”

By Jack (Anderson

Locked in the darkest re-
cesses of the Central Intelll-
gence Agency is the story of
six assassination attempts
against Cuba’s Fidel Castro,

For 10 years, only a few key
people have known the terri-
ble secret. They have sworn
never to talk, Yet we have)
learned the details from

sources whose credentials are
beyond question.

We spoke to John McCone,
who headed the CIA at the
time of the assassination at-
tempts. He acknowledged the
idea had been discussed Inside
the CIA but insisted it had
been “rejected immedi-
ately.” He vigorously denled
that the CIA had ever partici-
pated In any plot on Castro's
life. Asked whether the at-
tempts could have heen made
with his knowledge, he re-
plied: “It could not have hap-

teams were sent to Cuba. The
last team reportedly made it
to a rooftop within shooting
distance of Castro before they
were apprehended. This hap-
pened around the last of Feb.
ruary or first of March, 1963.

Nine months later, Prest-
dent Kennedy was gunned!
down in Dallas by Lee Harvey
Oswald, a fanatle who pre-
viously had agitated for Cas-
tro in New Orleans and had
made a mysterious trip to the
Cuban Embassy in Mexico

Long before his recent murder,

John Rosselli, the CIA’s underworld
recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-
tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in retall-
ation, were involved in the assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy.
Rosselli’s belief in a Cuban connec-
tion to the Kennedy assassination was
expressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long
ago as March, 1967, and also in private
conversations with a longtime’ associ- .
ate of Rosselli. who participated in
meetings between Rosselli and the
CIA. : .

MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT: Sabotage against Castro

Three small-scale sabotage operations have been approved by the
Special Group, but this recommendation is based on a routine con-
tinuation of broad policy guidance which I think you may wish

to review. The three operations involved are:

(1) a commando sabotage operation against a coastal
warehouse and pier;

(2) a sabotage attack jagainst naval or patrol vessels in
a harbor; and :

(3) a sabotage operation against a fuel barge proceeding
in coastal waters,,

All of these operations would: have been approved three months ago,

and indeed one of them is a rescheduling of an operation aborted

because of high seas, While itis always hard to predict the noise

level in these matters, these operations seem comparable to the :
small attack on a Cuban naval patrol which occurred in late December “
which Castro promptly blamed on you (in fact it was an operation :
approved before November 22 and not cancelled thereafter because it :
seemed to fall within the guidance you expressed, in your first review (

of the Cuban problem). \

The policy question now is this: If we continue these éven small

sabotage operations, Castro will certainly know it. Equally, | if we

call them off, he will know it, and so will the Russians.° n We thus ;
have an opportunity to choose. SN : ;

I doubt if this choice should be made on momentum alone,

I therefore recommend a Cabinet-level review of the whole principle
of covert sabotage against Cuba, I know that Rusk has never liked it
and that McNamara thinks it does very little good. . McCone and the CIA i
are for it, and so are most of the middle-level officers dealing with the
\ Castro problem. I myself consider the matter extremely evenly balanced,

but before hearing full argument, my guess is that in your position
I would stop sabotage attacks on the ground that they are illegal,
ineffective, and damaging to our broader policy. I might then wish
to make a little capital from this decision with the Soviet Union.

SUBJ: Connection Between Amlash Operation ‘and Investigation
of JFK Assassination
Background oo _ a

The staff's memorandum of January 5, 1976, postulated that the
Amlash operation might have had some effect on CIA's response to.
the investigation of President Kennedy's assassination. On January
9, 1976, the.staff dsked for access to the Amlash file at CIA; and
after a delay which was not explained, the staff was permitted to
review the file on January 23 and 26.

,

y Summary of Amlash File . . a 5

Amlash initially contacted by CIA in 1961 met occasional ly with
case officers through August 1962, at which time he was given instruc-
tion in secret writing and explosives. Interest in Amlash continued.
after the August meetings, but there was no further direct contact by CIA
agents until mid-1963. Why’ there was a year lapse in contact with Am-
' lash cannot be determined; the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962
undoubtedly made CIA cautious in dealing with Amlash.

In any event, DIR 48198" to Rome of 19 June 1963 states that
Amwhip , a Cuban exile who assisted CIA, had sent a letter as part of
an “activation effort to reluctant dragon. "Presumably, Amlash was
“reluctant dragon" and was, iby this letter, asked to recontact CIA.

In. late August, ‘amlash: traveled with a large contingent of Cuban
officials and athletes to Porto Alegre, Brazil. He cabled Amwhip
about his arrival on August 29. This cable apparently was the signal
that he was prepared to meet Amwhip in Porto Alegre.

Amwhip and two CIA case officers met with Amlash in Porto Alegre
between September 5 and 8. The two case officers have testified to
the Committee about their understanding of events at this series of
meetings which they viewed essentially as a get acquainted session.
CIA-messages tell a different story. Porto Alegre 0704 to DIR 6f 7
September stated that Amlash told Amwhip he felt’ there were only two
ways of getting rid of Castro. The first was an invasion by U.S.
forces which. Amlash knew was out of the question and the second was
an “inside job." Amlash indicated he was awaiting a U.S. plan of action.
He referred to the explosives demonstration CIA gave him a year earlier
as "too cumbersome" for his purposes.

At the conclusion of the meetings with Amlash, Headquarters

cabled on 9 September that, based on what little feel Headquarters
had, Amlash appeared hopeless as an intelligence performer and should
be approached as a chief conspirator allowed to recruit his own co-
horts. He should be urged to recruit a few trusted friends to assist
him, initially in "FI and Ops reporting" and then progress to sabotage
and more serious matters on an orderly basis. (DIR 67110 to Porto
Alegre, JMWAVE and Rio.) ae

On 11 September, Porto Alegre 0708 to DIR summarized the intel--

ligence information Amlash had given on Soviet units in Cuba, saying

-all IRBM and bombers had been removed. By this time Amlash had left
Brazil apparently heading for a vacation in Europe. i

A document in the file dated 16 September and marked OFPA 72775
appears to be a transcript of a conversation obtained by covert means.
There is no indication as to where the conversation takes place, but
it - Probably is in the Cuban Embassy in Paris.

7 "Mary: I don't want. to imagine ‘things but
this thing of Amlash. :
Moreno: It is either a tremendous secret or a x,
top secret matter (unreadable) then the
word "treason" or "reason").

Betty: I believe it is a top-secret matter."

By letters of September 14 and September 16, Amlash. stayed in
contact with Amwhip. Paris station apparently was picking up responsi-
bility for Amlash at this “time, since Paris 0706 to DIR dated 19
September asks for some background material on Amlash.

On 19 September, JMWAVE 4580 to DIR warns: that Amlash is part of
an anti-communist group in Cuba and details the membership of his group
as well as a communist group The message also notes that Fidel is
allegedly aware of the two groups and acts as moderator between them
in order to maintain cohesion in the Government of Cuba.

Neverthéless, Amwhip is asked to continue to work with Amlash
and is assigned to accompany him around Europe. According to Paris
0934 to DIR dated 7 October, Amlash met, with case officer O* on 5
October. Case officer g sat and-listened permitting Amlash to get
everything off his chest. Amlash seemed to be complaining about the
-low level espionage matters that had been discussed at the September
meeting in Brazil, implying he had a more valuable role. Case officer
0 "provided. necessary assurances his feelings not in fact true and
that his case receiving consideration highest levels. (emphasis added)‘!"
“With this problem which had undoubtedly been bothering Amlash con-

fee and Ry, however, were the principal case officers.

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 476 __ ~ oo ; ee
siderably, off his chest, a much more relaxed Amlash departed restating
his desire return Cuba to undertake ‘the big job.t"

On October 15, London 5224 to DIR states case officer O met with
Amlash and Amwhip on 13 October. Although. the case officer had been
forewarned by Amwhip, he was not successful in discouraging Amlash's
request for a high level meeting. "Amlash convinced that if such meet
does not take place at this time it will be almost impossible come out
again and we will be in same situation as last year with no definite
decision. Also finds it difficult to believe why RFK who receives many
Cubans would refuse to see a major" such as Amlash. ‘The message notes
the fact remains that Amlash does “have excellent entree to highest
target level which believe we cannot afford overlook." 3

This message seemingly moved Headquarters to re-evaluate Amlash's
role. DIR 75683 to London ‘on 15 October directed case officer 0 to -
return headquarters, soonest for discussions of all phases of the case.

The next meeting apparently took place on October 29. One case
officer met Amlash holding himself out as the personal representative
of RFK. He informed Amlash, according to a 13 November MFR, that
the U.S. was prepared to render all necessary assistance to any anti-
communist Cuban group which succeeded in neutralizing the present Cuban
leadership and which assumed significant control to invite the U.S.
to render assistance. He emphasized that U.S; support could come only |
after a successful coup. Amlash responded by saying that without Fidel,
the military would break up into 4 or 5 groups and the regime would
disintegrate. He also said he was satisfied with the policy discussion
but desired to know what technical support he could get.

Since Amwhip was closer to Amlash than the case officers, he was
asked about Amlash's reaction to the meeting. His reactions are
summarized in Attachment A to Amwhip's Memo of Meeting dated 14 Novem-
ber. Amwhip said Amlash was still not pleased with support from U.S.
government. While Amlash was satisfied on policy grounds, he was not
at all happy with the fact that he still was not given the technical
.assistance for the operation plan as he saw it. Amlash could not under-
stand why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which promised
a final solution to the problem, while, on the other hand, the U.S. gave
much equipment and money to exile groups. for their ineffective excursions
against Cuban coastal targets. Atlash had accepted the fact he had to
work with the CIA, but CIA might lose him if it continued to procrastin-»

“ate. Amlash talkéd about going to the Trench térrorist organization,
the OAS, but realized that was not feasible. The memorandum ends with
what apparently is the author's conclusion: “It is hoped that he does
realize that Havana must first be taken. ...-or failing that, a
truly sizeable piece of land (say, almost an entire province) which

-could be true rallying point." ;

Ly

In a Memo for Record dated 19 November, one case officer summarized
the actions to be taken at the next meeting with Amlash. Amlash was to
be told the U.S. was prepared to give full support to Amlash's coup.

He would be shown President Kennedy's speech in Miami of November. 18
and told this reaffirmed support for Amlash's proposal. Headquarters
had approved giving Amlash scopes and rifles and other equipment. The
memo ended by stating that’ "C/SAS* requested written reports on Amlash
operation be kept to a minimum."

Pari 1564 to DIR of 20 November indicated Amlash had been called
on the night of November 20 and had agreed to postpone his return to
Cuba in order to see case officer O "if it something interesting." The
CIA-officer said he could not assure it was interesting but -that it was
to be a meeting which Amlash had requested. (Obviously, CIA wanted to
give Amlash the “technical support" he felt he had not been promised in
the 29 October meeting.)

Case officer O flew from the U.S. so as to arrive in Paris on the morn-_

ing of November 22 for this meeting.

Pari 1607 to DIR received at Langley at 6:25 a.m. on 23, November
is the only message in Amlash's file reflecting the fact the meeting
had taken place. It indicated that Amlash was anxious to return to
Cuba and that case officer O was to arrive in Washington at 1810 that

day.

The file contains no outgoing cable to Paris on November 23 or
any other time telling Paris to break contact with Amlash.**

On 25 November, a contact report was prepared. There is reason
to question the authenticity of this document which is three pages
and reports the 22 November meeting with Amlash. The first two pages
have dark type as though prepared on a typewriter with a new ribbon.
The type on the third page is much lighter as though prepared on a

“typewriter with an old ribbon. Itimade no mention of the passing —
gf a poison pen to Amlash. : oo .

On November 27, Pari 1669 to DIR reports information obtained
in October possibly by clandestinely listening devices. A source com-
plained bitterly about official (Cuban) visitors to Paris and how they
denigrate the revolution.. The source said she wished she had a con-
cealed tape recorder to record these conversations. She named Amlash
as.one of these visitors.

* Desmond Fitzgerald

** In its 1967 report, the IG stated such a message had been sent
but could not be found. a

.
On 3 December, Headquarters furnished JMWAVE some details on the
Amlash meeting including the fact that he had been promised "full U.S.
support if he is successful in a real coup against the Castro regime."
He was also promised arms which will have to be furnished through
JMWAVE's operations. ; :

A series of confusing cables passed between Headquarters and JMWAVE
on December 6, 7, and 8. Apparently, Headquarters first gave JMWAVE
authority to drop a cache of arms in Cuba. Then Headquarters called
off the operation. In DIR 87615 of 7 December, it is noted “major
top level Cuban/Caribbean policy review scheduled early next week which
should provide basis for decision." : : I

JMWAVE complained about the change in orders in a cable of 8
December.  JMWAVE 8702 pointed out that one Headquarter's message .
indicated December infiltration operations were approved by higher. author
ity but a second message indicated a scheduled operation should be de-
layed and not run in December.

|

Headquarters responded in DIR 87880. Headquarters procedure
was to present infiltration operation plans to “higher authority"
even though there is a reasonable chance operation may be postponed -
or delayed as. was gase with the scheduled operation. "This procedure
will secure approval for the operation with only telephonic reconfirma-
tion needed when previously relaxed. operation finally mounted." Head-
quarters recommended delay until January after considering and equating
objectives against risk factors for Amlash and others. "Believe by
January, CIA should be in position better evaluate status of internal
assets," ;

By Pari 1914 of 13 December, Paris reported that Amlash left
Paris for Prague on November 27 but did not seek recontact with case
officer. DIR 90966 to JMWAVE of 23 December reported that Havana radio
on 2 December stated Amlash arrived Cuba on 1 December. ;

; The last document in Amlash's file for the period ending December
1963, is a long report on Amlash,-but it does not contain information
relevant to the October-November activities. Nevertheless, in red pen
on the cover page appears: "Dec 1963 Not to leave this office on Nestor’s
(Sanchez) orders."! followed by initials that appear to be ''GM."

One later document in the Amlash file contains’ more information
about the November 22, 1963 meeting. That document, a rough draft of
a biographical information sheet on Amlash (no final draft was found)
appears to have been preparediin 1966 at the time of Amlash's arrest
for a later plot against Castro. It states: "22 Nov. 63 Mr. Fitzgerald
and Mr. Sanchez assured subject that this Agency would give him every-
thing he needed. (telescopic sight, silencer, all the money he wanted).
The situation changed when Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Fitzgerald left the meet-
ing to discover that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Because
of this fact, plans with subject changed and it was. decided that this

?
me

Agency could have no part in the assassination of a government leader
(including Castro) and it- would not aid subject in his attempt. This
included the following. ."We would net furnish the silencer, nor scope
nor any money for direct assassination; furthermore, we would not lift

a finger to help subject escape from Cuba should he assassinate Castro."

The same document states this message was communicated to Amlash
in November 1964 by Mr. Sanchez. ;

Despite this decision,’ the CIA in fact continued to assist Amlash
through a cut-out until Amlash's arrest in 1966.

Later documents. on Amlash are also relevant to, the September-
November 1963 Amlash operation. Several such documents report informa-
tion received to the effect that Fidel Castro had long been aware of
Amlash's plots against him.. For example, Amlash's one time Cuban
mistress was believed to be working for Cuban intelligence and her
brother was known to be with Cuban intelligence. Pari 8242 to DIR
in December 1964 warns that Amlash's objective may be known to too
many Cubans. And, one CIA informant reported in-1966 on one known
double agent of Cuban intelligence working for CIA-and said the CIA's
Cuban operations had been penetrated at a high level by Cuban intel-
ligence. He identified this latter individual only as one of the Cuban

exiles who was knowledgeable-of a number of the most important opera-
tions. Nevertheless, Amlash's file contains nothing to indicate any
detailed analysis of these possible penetrations of. the CIA's Amlash

operation, although a cryptic handwritten note on at least one re~
port rejects the suggestion that Amlash was himself reporting to Castro.

One other document bears on the testimony Amlash's case officers
gave before the Select Committee to the effect that Amlash was given _
' a poison pen for self-protection. That document reports that Amlash,
and other Cuban officials in Paris in 1963, were carrying pistols for
self-protection throughout their travel in Europe.

Finally, although the staff has not reviewed all possible CIA
files to determine what other operations Castro might have been re=
ferring to in his September 7 statement, the Amlash file indicates
that some coastal landings of supplies in August were ‘the only other
CIA operations conducted against Cuba in this time period.

Scenario for B-9

This doctrine is based on the proposition that
the decision has been reached that the U.S. cannot live

with a Castro/communist regime in Cuba which continues

_its present course of ‘Subversion and aggression in Latin

America and that we. are determined to take appropriate

action to put an end to these acts.

1. In the Venezuelan arms cache case now before
the OAS hold out for a "blank check” resolution. Settle
for a 13 vote majority regardless of Mexican, Brazilian,
or Chilean support. F

2. If, despite 1. above, OAS waters down resolu-}
tion, vote against the watered-down version.

3. %If "blank check” resolution passed, proceed
to 5. below,

4. If watered-down resolution passed over our
protest, announce publicly that CAS no longer represents
an adequate hemispheric safeguard and therefore that the
United States must unilaterally declare (see 5. below).

5. Declare publicly that further aggression and
subversion by Castro in Latin America would be intolerable

to the United States and, in the event of a new act on the

part of Castro of the nature and magnitude of the Venezuelan

6.. Explain carefutiy through diplomatic
channels to the Soviet Union that the United States
finds the present behavior of the Castro/comunist
regime in Cuba intolerable, that Cuba's activities in
Venesuela prove this to be s0 and that further acts
of violence of comparable danger or potential danger
on the part of Cuba will cause the U.S. to feel no
longer bound by any inhibitions against invasion or
other appropriate action. Urge the Soviet Union, in

‘the U.S, to live peacefully with the Castro/conmunist
regime in Cuba, to assure that Cuba is restrained
from repeating its dangerous practices. Make it plain

7. Decide upon the. type of action on the part
of Castro which would trigger action on the part of the
U.S. .A rule of thumb could be: such action as would

_ represent serious, realized or potential, danger to the
stability of a Latin American state, By this criterion

- 20 Castro-trained men and four tons of arms introduced
into northeast Brazil might not constitute a trigger,
whereas the same effort by Castro ina Central American
country might. The judgment can be unilateral and
subjective on the part of the U.S.

8. Formulate a program for a post~Castro Cuba

giving full weight to the real changes which have taken

Cc : place there during the past five years and, full recog~
nition to the need for channeling Castro's unfinished
revolution into constructive lines. .

The above scenario should net be commenced unlesa
it is recognized that, although these actions are
prinarily designed to deter Castro from his present course,
he may very well persevere in his policy. Under such
circumstances the U.S., having publicly embarked on the

. doctrine, cannot then withdraw from the consequences.

SPECTRUM OF COURSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO CUBA

!
i
‘

|

Accepting as valid the Attorney General's statement
that there is no point in discussing courses of action
with respect to Cuba until the fundamental decision is
made ag to whether or not it is possible for the United .
States to live with Castro, the following possibie
; courses of action are listed under the headings "Can
a Live with Castro" and "Can't Live with Castro." Neither .
of these headings is absolute; the courses of action
listed under each are indicative of degrees of accepta-
bility of the Castro regime or conversely the urgency
to overthrow it. . oO
’ j
¢

COURSES OF ACTION

A. Can Live with Castro

1. Negotiate a detente with Fidel looking towards
full recognition of his regime and unlinite rade
between the United states and tuba. The negotiator of
the detente would endeavor to Secure fron Castro, com
mitments not to engage in subversive activities in
Latin America and not to engage in polemics against
the United States. He would also endeavor to reduce
or eliminate, as a result of our concessions, Soviet
presence in Cuba and reduce the Cuban military machine
to one compatible with the requirements of a peaceful
Latin American island republic.

No covert activities would be undertaken and
intelligence operations would be of a nature compat~
ible with our relations with a neutral power. .

2. Do nothing. No specific efforts will be made
to arrangs a rapprochement with Fidel but we would.
remain receptive to any advances made by him, No
covert operationg would'be undertaken and intelligence
operations would not include black maritime operations

into Cuba,

It would be hoped that Fidel, recognizing

the good faith and good. will of the new Administration,
would make his own advances leading towards a satis-

factory detente,

-: feasible pressures on Cuba and at ereating and exploiting’
‘gituations in Cuba calculated to stimulate dissident elements
: vs whtbin the regime, particulariy in the amced forces, to carry
tm, . -@as @ coup. The objective of the ceup would be to remove .
"la. + the Cagstvo/Comm=mists from the regime and to elininate the
~ entire Soviet presence from Cuba, Reeognizing that the U.S.
- dg engeged in a rate agninst time with Cuba and ita Soviet
ally to obstruct the congolidation bf Castro's regine at hong
. @ad to prevent bin from achieving his echitions in Latin
“ America, we set the time frame for this program at stent
eighteen meaths from June 1363. ,

ms Aa originally concetved and approved in June 1963, the -
 gowert action prosram waa based on the assumption that U.S,
““. pelicy precludes a military invasion or a full blockade of
(:.. Gaba which could lead to a confrontation with the Soviet Unions
“-° En addition, the covert action prograa was and ig prediested |
“... @m the thesis that its chance of success would depend heavily
. @% & sustained aad intensive effort in ether sectors, parti<-
eularly the overt economic denial and political isolation
. prograzs, by ail elements of the United States Goverment.

” (Silefee.) Then, a last comment:
“The continuation of the blockade depends on the con-
tinuation of subversive activities.

The interview was over, I did not really wish to sug-
gest anything, since I had never been to Cuba and,
on the other hand, I had heard from ail sides tales of
the privations the Cuban people were suffering owing
to their isolated economic situation. But I could see
plainly that John Kennedy had doubts, and was is seeking
away out.

That same evening I recounted this conversation in
detail to an American colleague — an intimate friend of
President Kennedy, through whem I had obtained this
interview ~and to the editor of The New Republic.
Both my confidants, who knew the President a thou-
sand times better than I, agreed that John F. Kennedy
had never before expressed hisrmaiéso specifically and
with such feeling on his understanding of the first
phase of the Castro revolution. They hesitated to draw

"any political conclusions from his remarks. However,

they were .not surprised at Kennedy's © invitation to
come and see him again when I returned from Cuba.
In effect, John Kennedy displayed two basic charac-
teristics in his exercise of power: first, an overwhelming
degree of empiricism and realism. -A man without a
particular doctrine, he reacted decisiv ely to events, and
only to events. Nothing but the shock of collision with
a problem was sufficient to make him come to a deci-
sion, and because of this, his decisions were unpredic-
table. At. that point he had a consuming need for
information, and this need had increased a great deal
since experience had taught him not to rely solely on
official channels.

est: he pulled at his beard, yanked his parachutist’s
beret down aver his eyes, adjusted his maqui tunic, all
the while making me the target of a thousand maliciow.
sparks cast by his deep-sunk, lively eyes. At one point -
I felt as though I were playing the rale of that partner
with whom he had as strong a desire to confer as to do
battle; as though T myself were in a small way that
intimate enemy in the White House whom Khrushchev
described to Fidel as someone with whom “it is pos-
sible to talk.” Three times he had me repeat certain re-
marks, particularly those in which Kennedy expressed
his criticism of the Batista regime, those in which Ken-
nedy showed his impatience with the comments attrib-
uted to General. de Gaulle, and lastly those in which
Kennedy accused Fidel of having almost caused a war
fatal to all humanity.

When I stepped ta Iking, I expected an explosion.
Instead, | was treated to a lengthy silence. and, at-the
end of that silence, to a calm, composed, often humor-
ous, always thoughtful exposition. I don’t know wheth-
er Fidel has changed, or whether these cartoons. cari-
caturing him as a ranting madman which appear in the
Western press perhaps correspond to’a former reality.
T only know that at no time during the two complete
days I spent with him (and during which a great deal
happened), did Castro abandon his composure and
poise. Here too, I shall let Castro speak for himself,
reserving only the possibility of correcting certain judg-
ments on these two political leaders based on my own
experiences in Cuba. :

Communisyy. But I feel that he inherited a difficult
situation; I don’t think a President of the United States

is ever really free, and I believe Kennedy is at present

feeling the impact of this lack of freedom. I also believe
he now understands the extent to which he has been
misled, especially, for example, on Cuban reaction at
the time of the attempted Bay of Pigs invasion. J also
pink bejsa realists he is now registering that it im
possible to simply wave a wand and cause us, and the
explosive situation throughout Latin America, to dis-

appear.

Why the Missiles Were Installed

“There is one point on which I want to give you new
information. right away. 1 have refrained from doing
this until now; but today an attempt is being made to
frighten all mankind by propagating the idea that
Cuba, and in particular I, might provoke a nuclear war,
so I feel the world should know the true story of the
missile emplacement.

Adzhubei, came to pay us a visit before going on to
Washington at the invitation of Kennedy's associates.
Immediately upon arriving in Washington, Adzhubei
had been received by the American Chief Excculive,
and their talk centered particularly on Cuba: A week

ing

after this interview, we received in Havana a copy of -

Adzhubei’s report to Khrushchev. It was this report
which triggered the whole situation.

“What did Kennedy say to Adzhubei? Now listen to

this carefully, for it is very important: he had said that

— the new situation in Cuba was intolerable for the Unit-

and States, that the American government Hid decided

upon and [at this point Castro emphasized his’ state-
ment by pronouncing each sysemele separately] Ken-
jedy reminded the Russians that the United States
had not betervened in Hungary, which was obviously
a way of demanding Russian non-intervention in the
event of a possible invasion. To be sure, the actual word
(jnussion —as-—hol- mentioned and —Adzbubel—atthe

time, lacking any back
draw the same couslusions as we did. But when we

communicated to Khrushchev all our previous informa-
tion, the Russians too began to interpret the Kennedy-
Adzhubei conversation as we saw it and they went to
the source of our information. By the cad of a mont a
the Russian and ban governments
definit iction that an invasion
from one mome xt This is the truth.
“What was to be done? How could we prevent the
invasion? We found that Khrushchev was concerned
about the same things that were worrying us. He asked
us what we wanted. We replied: do qwlhiatever is needed

Tace

to convince the United States tat duvet bL bal dimbedd 1A

is the sme ass ‘ doh ion. And how
to realize this objective? All our thinking and discus-
sions revolved around this point. We thought of a
proclamation, an alliance, conventional military aid.
The Russians expisined to us that their concern was
twofold: first, they wanted to save the Cuban revolu- -
tion (in other words, their socialist honor in the eyes
of the world), and at the same time they wished to
avoid a world conflict. They reasoned that if conven-
tional military aid was the extent of their assistance,
the United States might not hesitate to instigate an
invasion, in which case Russia would retaliate and this °
would inevitably touch off a world war.”

At this point I interrupted to ask how Cubs could
have been absolutely certain of Soviet intervention.
After all, I said, Stalin certainly “let down” Markos,
the Chief of the Greek Communist Resistance, because
such help would have conflicted with prevailing zones

* of influence.

“I know,” Castro replied, “but the two situations ;
cannot b& compared.” Then he continued:

“Russia was much too deeply committed to us. More-
over, since then we have had every proof of the im-
mense. solidarity of the Soviet people and its leaders.
You can s¢2 for yourself how clearly this solidarity is
manifest here. Then there is. something else, specifi-
cally apropos of Stalin. When I was in the USSR and
others, outside Russia, were reproaching Khrushchev
for taking a more conciliatory stand4han Stalin toward
the capitalists, Khrushchev confided to me several ex-
amples, which I will not repeat to you, illustrating the
prudence, even the abdication of Stalin. He told me-
and I believe him = that Stalin would never have em-
placed missiles in Cuba.
“Tt is true that it was said then by other factions
that the real reason for installing the missiles was
because certain.internal problems were driving the Rus-
sians to use us to provoke the United States. | am here
to tell you that the Russians didn’t want and do not
today want war. One only need visit them on their
home territory, watch them at work, share their eco-
nomic concerns, admire their intense efforts to raise the
workers’ standard of living, to understand right away
that they are far, very Far, from any idea of provocation
or domination. However, Soviet Russia was confronted
by two alternatives: an absolutely inevitable war (be-
cause of their commitments and their position in the
socialist world), if the Cuban revolution was attacked:
or the risk of a war if the United States, refusing to
retreat before the missiles, would not give up the at-
tempt to destroy Cuba. They chose socialist solidarity
and_the risk of war. . : , -

“Under these circumstarices, how could we Cubans
have refused to share the risks taken to save us? It
was, in the final analysis, a question of honor, don’t
you agree? Don’t you believe that honor plays a role
in politics? You think we are romantics, don’t you?
Perhaps we are. And why not? In any event, we are
militants. In a word, then, we agreed to the emplacc-
ment of the missiles. And I might add here that for us
Cubans it didn’t really make so much difference
whether we died by conventiona! bombing or a hydro-
gen bomb. Nevertheless, we werd * gambling with
the peace of the world. The United States was the one
ta jeopardize the peace af mankind by using the threat
of war to stifle revolutions. ;

“And so in June, 1962, my brother Raoul and Che
Guevara went to Moscow to discuss ways and means
of.installing the missiles. The convoy arrived by sea in
three weeks. The United States was able to find out
that weapons were being shipped in, of course; but it
took them two months to discover that these weapons
were guided missiles. Two months... in other words,
longer than we had éalculated. Because, of course, we
were seeking intimidation, not aggression,”

‘Alliance for Progress

The. conversation now. turned to the Alliance for Prog-
ress. ‘In a way,’ Castro said, “it was a good idea, it
marked progress of a sort. Even if it can be said that it
was: overdue, timid, conceived on the spur of the
moment, under constraint... despite all that fam awvill-

“ing to‘agree that the idea in-®#t @nstituted an effort

to adapt to the extraordinarily rapid course of events in
Latin America. Such as, for example, what we read in

will cause more commotion on the sev York stock
evchange than Castroism! The Catholic and military
conservatives of Argentina, the factions’ most closely
linked with’ American interests! There is talk of na-
tivnalizatidn of industries there, of agrarian reform
there... well and good! If the Alliance for Progress
provokes these developments, then it’s not doing so
badly; all these things are consonant with the aspira-
tions of the peaple. I can look back to the days of
Eisenhower, or rather of Nixon, and recall the furore
which broke out when the United States and Cuba to-
gether decteed an agrarian reform which was to apply,
mark this well, only to landowners of over 200,000
hectares! Yes, 200,000! Yet the reaction of the trusts
was terrible at that time. Nowadays, in the other Latin
American countries, because the Communist banner is
used as a bogeyman, the reaction of the American

. trusts is shrewder. They are going to choose strawmen,

so as to rule indirectly, But there will be difficulties.
“This is: why Kennedy's good ideas aren’t going, to
vield any results. Tt is very easy to understand and at

“this point he surely is aware of this because, as I told

you, he isa realist. For years and Years American policy
~not the government, but the trusts and the Pentagon
~ has supported the Latin American oligarchies. All the
prestige, the dollars, and the power was held by a class
which Kennedy himself has described in speaking of
Batista. Suddenly a President arrives on the scene who
ties to support the interests of another class (which
has no access to any of the levers of power) to give the
various Latin American countries the impression that
the United Sates no longer stands behind the dictators,
and so there is no more need.to start Castro-type revo-
utions.” What happens then? The trusts see that their
interests are being a little compromised (just barely,
but still compromised); the Pentagon thinks the strate- .
gic bases are in danger; the powerful oligarchies in all
the Latin American countries alert their American
friends; they sabotage the new policy; and in short,
Kennedy has everyone against him. The few liberal or
alleyedly liberal presidents who were chosen as instru-

ments of the new policy are ‘swept out of office, like

Bosch in Santo Demingg, or else they are transformed.
Betancourt, for example, was not a Batista; now he
has become one.

“In view of all these things, how can the American
government seriously believe that Cuban subversion is
at the root of explosions taking place all over the”
South American continent? In Venezuela, fox,example,
are you familiar with the situation there? Dou think
the Venezuclans need us to understand what's going
on in their country? Do you think we don’t have
enough problems of aur awn? Right now T ask only
one thing: Leave us in peace to better our country’s
economic situation, to put our planning into effect, to

This doesn’t mean we
do not feel solidarity toward nations that are struggling
and suffering, like the Veneeuclan people. But it is up
to’ those nations to decide what they want, and if they
choose other regimes than ours, this isn’t our business.”

educate our young conipaticres,

“We Have Always Lived with Daviger”

Tasked Fidel where is this all going to end? How will
the situation develop? Even if the United States uses
against you what you call the alibi of Communism, it
still remains true thet you have chosen Conmuatisii,
that your economy and your security depend on the
Soviet Union, and that even if you have no ulterior mo-
tives in this, association, still the United States considers
that you are part. of an international strategy, that you
constitute a Soviet base in a world where peace depends
on mutual respect for a tacit division of zones of in-
fluence.

“T don’t want to discuss our ties with the Soviet
Union,” Fidel Castro cut me short. “I find this indecent.
We have none but feelings of Fraternity and profound,
total gratitude toward the USSR. The Russians are
making extraordinary efforts on our behalf, efforts
which sometimes cost them dear. But we have our own
policies which are perhaps not always the same (we
have proved this!) as those of the USSR. I refuse to
dwell on this point, because asking me to say that | am
not a pawn on the Soviet chesstepgLis something like
asking a woman to shout aloud in the public square
that she is not a prostitute.

“Tf the United States. sees the problem as you have
posed it, then you are right, there if no way out. But
who is the loser in the last analysis? They have tried
everything against us, everything, absolutely every-
thing, and we are still alive and getting better day by
day; we are still standing upright, and we plan to cele-
brate with greater festivities than usual, on January 1,
1964, the fifth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution!
The United States’ policy of isolating us economically
is less effective with each passing day; we are increas-
ing our trade with the rest of the world. Even’ with
Spain! We have just sold a shipment of 300,000 tons
of sugar to the Spaniards. Far from’ discouraging us,
the blockade is maintaining the revolutionary atmos-
phere we need to stiffen the country’s backbone. Are we
in danger? We have always lived “With danger. To say
nothing of the fact that you have no idea how many
friends one discovers in the world when one is perse-
cuted wd by. the United StataaggamN ste truly, for all these
reasons, we are not suppliants, we ask nothing. Vi
tell you something else: since the rupture and the
blockade, we have forgotten the United States. We feel

which diplomatic relations with the United States
would pose! The Swiss Ambassador #epresenting the
Us at present. I prefer to do business with him than

with 200 members of an Embassy among whom surely

some spies would be spotted.

“T have just talked to you as a Cuban revolutionary.
But I should also speak to you as a peace lover, and
from this viewpoint [ believe the United States is too
important a country not to have an influence on world
peace. I cannot help hoping, therefore, that a leader
will come to the fore in North America (why not Ken-
nedy, there are things in his favor!), who will be willing
to brave unpopularity, fight the trusts, tell the truth
and, most important, let the various nations act: as
they see fit. T ask nothing: neither dollars, nor assist-
ance, nor diplomats, nor bankers, nor military men --
nothing but peace, and ta be accepted as we are! We
are socialists, the United States is a capitalist nation,
the Latin. American countries will choose what they
want. All’'the same, at a time when the United States
is selling wheat to the Russians, Canada is trading with
China, de Gaulle respects Ben Bella, why should it be”
impossible to make the Americans understand that _.
sacialism leads, not to hostility toward them, but to co-
existence? Why am | not Tito or Sekou Touré? Because
the Russians have never done us any injury such as”
the Yugoslavians and the Guineans have complained
of in the past, and because the Americans have never
given us any of the benefits for which these two nations
congratulate themselves today.

“As to this matter of fearing Soviet intentions in
Latin America through Cuba’s. subversive activitic:,
this is just attributing to: others one’s own desire to

dominate. You said yourself just a little while ago tha:

the Russians have had enough of their Cuban involve-
ment. Economically this is obvious. This is why, speak-
ing from a military viewpoint, it is better not to force
nations to turn to the Russians for help. Really, it
seems to me that 4 man like Kennedy is capable of
secing that it is not in the United States’ interest to
pursue a policy, which can lead only to a stalemate. So
far as we are concerried, everything can be restored to
normalcy on the basis of mutual respect of sover-
cignty.”

In conclusion, Fidel Castro said to me: “Since you
are going to sce Kennedy again, be an emissary of ©
peace, despite everything. [ want to make myself clear:
[ don’t want anything, I don’t expect anything, and
as a revolutionary the present situation does not dis-
please me. But.as a man and as a statesrffen, it is my
duty to indicate what the bases for understanding
could be.” :

All this was said two days before President Ken-
nedy’ s death.

The minutes of the June 18, 1964, meeting (dated June 22, 1964)
contained the following: | OBTAIN COPY] (signed by Peter Jessup)
"A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve
the underworld to assassinate certain Cuban leaders.
Mx. McCone was somewhat skeptical of the reported plots and
stated that he would like to go into the matter further.
Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was
being put on notice and should do everything in its power to
ascertain promptly the veracity of the reports and then under-
take prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy would call the
Matter to the Attorney General’ s attention as a matter of law
enforcement.”

Mr. ‘McCone's personal memorandum for the record on this
meeting (dated) June 18, 1964, contains substantially the same

information. [OBTAIN COPY] It refers to a June 10, 1964, CIA
memorandum “reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate
leading Cuban government leaders. This memo apparently had
een sent to Special Group members and the Attorney General.
[OBTAIN COPY] McCone's memo contains the following:

"ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms steps we
should take to establish the credibility of the report; also
communicate with the FBI ithrough Mr. Papich. Also I should

call the Attorney General personally."

FON
3 A)

‘Ic was around 1:32 in the afternoon, Cuban time. We
were having luncit in the living room of the modest
summer residence which Fidel Castro owns on magni-
feent Maradero Beach, 120 kilometers from Havaina.
For at feast the tenth time, I was questioning the Cuban
icader on details of the negotiations with Russia before
the missile installations last year, The telephone rang,
a secretary in guerrilla garb announced that Mr, Dar-

ticds, President of eont

‘Gmmunication forthe Deine Mivishon Fidel wicked|up’

the phone and [ heard him say: “Como? Un atentada?”
(What's that? An attempted assassination?”) He then
turned to-us to say that Kennedy had just been struck
down in Dallas. Then he went back to the telephone
and exclaimed in a loud voice “Herida? Muy grave-
viente”” (“Wounded? Very seriously?”)

He came back, sat down, and repeated three times
he words: “Es tna mala noticia.” (‘This is bad news.”)
He remained silent for a moment, awaiting another gall
with firther news. He remarked while we waited that
there was an alarmingly sizable lunatic fringe in Amer-
can society and that this deed could equally well have
ve“ he work of a madman or of a terrorist. Perhaps a
Vietnamese? Or a member of the Ku Klux Klan? The

~econd call came through: it was hoped they would be .

abie to announce that the United States President was
“ll ative, that there was hope of saving him. Fidel
Castro’s immediate reaction was: “If they can, he is
eady re-elected.” He pronounced these words with
satisfaction. , i

This sentence was a sequel to a conversation we had
acid on a previous evening and which had turned into
an all-night session. To be precise, it lasted from torn
the evening until 4 in the morning. A good part jof
the talk revolved about the impressions I recounted
to him of an interview which President Kennedy
granted me this last October 24, and about Fidel
Castro’s reactions to these impressions. During this
nocturnal discussion, Castro had delivered himself lof

+ relentless indictment of US policy, adding that in, the

recent past Washington had had ample opportunity

to normalize its relations with Cuba, but that instead ;

ithad tolerated a CIA program of training, equipping
and organizing a counter-revolution. He had told the
smat he wasn’t in the least fearful of his life, since

danger was his natural milieu, and if he were to become :

1 victim of the United States this would simply en-

ha. his radius of influence in Latin America as well

as throughout the socialist world. He was speaking, he

said, from the viewpdtt of the interests of peace jin

in, Vallero would translate it for. Fidel:

Heard | the S News

ree

both the American” continasts meteeachieve this goat, a

leader would have'to arise in the United States capable
of understanding the explosive realities of Latin Amer-
ica and of meeting them ha alfway. Then, suddenly, he
had taken a less hostile tack: “Kennedy could still be
this man. He still has the possibility of becoming,
in the eyes of history, the greatest President of the
United States, the leader w ho may at last understand
that there can be coexistence between capitalists and
socialists, even in the Americas. He would then be
an even greater President than Lincoln. 1 know, for
example, that for Khrushchev, Kennedy is a man you
can talk with. I have gotten this impression from all
my conversations with Khrushchev. Other leaders nave
assured me that to attain this goal, we must first await
his re-election. Personally, | consider him responsible
for everything, but I will say this: he has come to
understand many things over the past few. months;
and then.too, in the Jast analysis, I’m convinced that
anyone else would be worse.’ Then Fidel had added
with a broad and boyish grin: “If you see him again,
you can tell him that I’migsglling to declare Goldwater
my friend if that will guarantee Kennedy's re-election!”

This conversation was heid on November 19.

Now it was nearly 2
the table and settled ourselves in front of a radio.
Commandant Vallero; his physician, aide-de-camp, and
intimate friend, was easily able to get the broadcasts
from the NBC network in Miami. As the news came
Kennedy
wounded in the head; pursuit of the assassin; murder
of a policeman; finally the fatal announcement: Presi-

; dent  Rennedy is dead. Then Fidel stood up and said to

“Everything is changed. Everything is going to
change. The United States accupies such a position in
world affairs that the death of a President of that
country affects millions of people in every corner of
the globe. The cold war, relations with Russia, Latin
America, Cuba, the Negro question ... all will have to
be rethought. I'll tell you ong thing: at least Kennedy
was an enemy to whom we had become accustomed.
This is a serious matter, an etremely serious matter.”

After the quarter-hour of silence observed by all
the American radio stations, we once more tuned in
on Miami; the silence had only been broken by a re-
broddcasting of the American national anthem. Strange
indeed was the impression made, on hearing this hyma
ring out in the house of Fidel Castro, in thé midst of a
of worried faces. ‘“Now,’” Fidel said, “they will
hav to find the -assassin quickly, but very guickl y,

Sierra there were some an:
other) who wanted to kill Batista. They thought they
could do away with a regime by ecapitating it. I have
always been violently opposed to such nicthods. First
of all from the viewpoint of political self-interest, be-
cause so far as Cuba is concerned, if Batista had been
killed he would have been replaced by some military
figure who would have tried to make the revolutionists
pay for the martyrdom of the dictator. But I was also
opposed to it on personal grounds; assassination is
repellent to me.” Oo i

The broadcasts were now resumed. One reporter
felt he should mention the difficulty Mrs. Kennedy
was having in getting tid of her bloodstained stockings.
Fidel exploded: “What sort of a mind isithis!” He re-
peated the remark several times: “What sort of a
mind is this? There is a difference in our civilizations
after all. Are you like this in Europe? For us Latin
Americans, death is a sacred matter; not only does it
mark the close of hostilities, but it also imposes de-
cency, dignily, respect. There are even jstrect urchins
who behave like kings in the face of death, Incidentally,
this reminds me of something else: if:you write all
those things I told you paeraday against Kennedy's
policy, don’t use his name now; speak instead of the
policy of the United States government./’

Toward 5 o'clock, Fidel Castro declared that since
there was nothing we could do to alter the tragedy, we
must try to put our time to good use inspite of it, He
wanted to accompany me in person on a visit to a
granja de pueblo (state farm), where hd had been en-
gaging in some experiments. His present obsession is
agriculture. He reads nothing but agronomical studies

and reports. He dwells lyrically on the soil, fertilizers, -

and the possibilities which will give | Cuba. enough
sugar cane by 1970 to achieve.economic! independence.

oO “Didn't | Tell You" .

1

We went by car, with the radio oh. The Dallas
police were now hot on the trail-of the assassin. He
is a Russian spy, says the news commentator. Five
minutes later, correction: he is. a spy married to a
Russian. Fidel said: “There, didn’t I teil you; itll be

Tmy.turn next.” Bubsesh yea, The next word was: the

assassin is a Marxist deserter. Then the word came
through, in effect, that the assassin was a young man
who was a member of the “Fair Play for Cuba Com-
mittee,” that he was an admirer of Fidel Castro. Fidel
declared: “If they had had proof, they would have said

|
|
{

hi Ubiie

he was an agent, an accomplice, a hired killer. In
saying simply that he is an admisgc, this is just to trv |
and make an association in people’s minds between the
name of Castro and the emotion awakened by the
assassination. This is a publicity method, a propaganda
device, It’s terrible. But you know, I’m sure this will -
all soon blow over. ‘There are too many competing
policies in the United States for any single one to be
able to impose itself universally for very long.”

We arrived at the granja de pueblo, where the farm-
ers welcomed Fidel. At that very moment, a speaker
announced over the radio that it was now known that
the assassin is a “pro-Castro Marxist.” One commen-
tator followed another; the remarks became increas-
ingly emotional, increasingly aggressive. Fidel then
excused himself: “We shall have to give up the visit
to the farm.” Wenwenton toward Matanzas fromhere
he cou a macbicoa, On the way he
had questions: “Who is Lyndon Johnson? What is his
reputation? What were his relations with Kennedy?
With Khrushchev? What was his position at the time of
the attempted invasion of Cuba?” Finally’ and most
important of all: Wh it ercise
over_the CIA?” Then abruptly he looked at his watch,
Taw that it would be half an hour before we teached
Matanzas and, practically on the spat, he dropped off to
sleep.” :

After Matanzas, where he must have decreed a state
of alert, we returned to Varadero for dinner. Quoting
the words spoken to him by a woman shortly before,
he said to me that it was an irony of history for the
Cubans, in the situation to which they had been re-
duced by the blockade, to have to mourn the death of
a President of the United States. “After all,” he added,
“there are perhaps some peopie in the world to whom
this news is cause for rejoicing. The South Vietnamese
guerrillas, for example, and also, I would imagine,
Madame Nhu!”

“I thought of the people of Cuba, accustomed to the
sight of posters like the one depicting the Red Army
with maquis superimposed in front, and the screaming
captions “HALT, MR. KENNEDY! CUBA IS NOT ALONE... .”
I thought of all those who had been led to associate
their deprivations with the policies of President John
F, Kennedy. . :

At dinner I was able to take up all my questions.
What had motivated Castro to endanger the peace of
the world with the missiles in Cuba? How dependent
was Cuba on the Soviet Union? Is it not possible to

- envisage relations between Cuba andthe United States

along the.same lines as those betwéen Finland and the
Russians?’ How was the transition made from the
“humanism of Sierra Maestra to the Marxism-Leninism
of 1961? Fidel Castro, once more in top form, had an
explanation for everything. Then he questioned me

intellectual qualities of the “ssassinated President, |
awakened the keenest interest in him.

The Cubans have lived with the United tates in

Kennedy said. It seemed now somehow a special grace

Just as Secret Service men reacted instinctively, rushing to protect the
presidential party, reporters reacted instinctively to get the news—sketchy
as it was at first-to the world. United Press International's Merriman
Smith, dean of the White House correspondents, describes on pages 32-33
his frantic rush to call the Dallas UPI bureau. Reproduced here is the result
of Smith's first efforts—the actual Teletype copy that almost immediately
clacked -out of hundreds of UPI machines in newsrooms, radio and
television stations, pressrooms, and business offices all over the world.

Minneapolis murder trial.

The Dallas bureau, alerted by
Smith over radiotelephone from
the press car as it careered
toward the hospital, sends out
the first sparse news.

Minneapolis starts to add more
details on the murder trial. The
New York bureau, knowing

that ace reporter Smith is covering
the President's trip, tells all
bureaus to “uphold”—get off the
wire. “Dallas, it’s yours.”

Atlanta tries to interrupt, but is
quickly squelched by the
New York bureau.

The Dallas operator begins
sending the rest of Smith’s account
from the press car. :

At the hospital, Smith sees the
President’s limp body in the cai

12:39, nine minutes after the
shooting, the grave news flashes

Smith rolls on, swiftly and

fluently, adding fresh details as

“pandemonium” breaks out
in the corridor outside his
telephone niche.

Searching his mind for
impressions of the shooting,
Smith adds all he can remember
to the story. The shaken wire

As yet nothing is known of the

Dear Mr. Heacock: OD Sp >5975

Thank you for writing to me regarding your knowledge of
the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. I understand
that you have discussed these questions at length with members
of the Committee staff.

On March 1 the Committee reported S.. Res. 400 ereating
a Senate Committee on Intelligence Activities. The legislation
which was before us concerned only the establishment of a new
congressional committee; it did not involve revisions that. would
significantly modify the Structure or the powers of the CIA it-
self. The Committee has not been authorized to hire additional |
staff personnel for the purpose of this legislation. Further-
more, we were under instructions from the Senate. to report out a.
formal. recommendation in the form of legislation by March 1.

I am, however, deeply concerned with the charges you
have made because, if true, they represent grave examples of
corruption and criminality. It is my hope and intent that the
new committee created by. the legislation we are considering,
once it is established, will have the jurisdiction and the re-
sources to explore the kind of issues which you raise.

I assure you that the entirety of the information you
have submitted to my committee will be made available to the
new Congressional oversight committee.

I am sure you understand the constraints on the Govern-
ment Operations Committee which prevent us. from undertaking the
investigations you suggest, but I shall forward the material
you submitted to the new committee as soon as it is established. :

‘For your information, I am enclosing a copy of S. Res.
400 and a copy of the committee's report on this measure.

Sincerely,
Che its wil

Dear Senator Ribicoff:

Destiny has chosen you tha second tina in seven years to chair a come
mittes with capability of establishing legislativa remedies to prevent
domestic and foreign agsassinations, have corruption uithin military
supply streams, multi billien doller currency manipulation and massive
intervention of the CIA in demstie covert operations,

On or about March 6, 1959 you were the acting chairman of the Permanent
Investigations Subcommittee that heard Cornelius Hawkridge, my witness,
. deseribe a mubtd billion dollar currency manipulation racke® in South
Viethan Carmine Esllino, staff investigator, prevented Hawkvidya from .
algo testifying about truck convoys of stolen military arms and supplies
that he ooserved heading toward the Canbedia border, the "fence" for :
these stolen arng was the fabulous Soviet KGB agent Jarque3 Yang, dos~<

The Soviet KGB let a contract with orgaaized erime’s CAA assavsdnation

Williaa $. Wood, alias Williaa Poxley, CIA alias Willice Harvey and
double agont for KGB fingered Hawkridgs ond his wite Aigela, a ‘baby
sitter agent for wast German and CIA intelligence. Ji the contrived
track-car “accident™ Hawkridge was crippled for life.

I met with CIA'a Yarvey as Boxley in Novexbor, 1968, 4: New Ovleans
pursuant to my counterintelligence investigations. Harvey, witness
before the Sonate Intalligence Committea, has admitted his rolo a3
organizer of the ZR/RITLE Executive Action assassinatisa capabllity
and his contacts with John Roaselli and Sam Gianeana of organized erhae
to implement that capability. Harvey incorrectly gjueyed to the conclu}
gion for the KGB that Haweridge was a cooperative sourts of much of my
accurate countorintslligence on KGB. ,

Hawkridge had precipitated your investigation by appeaiing to a Troasury
official. The official pravailed upon Senator John McSlellan, thon

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 554
Chairman of your Comaitisa, to conduct it. He first exposed tha facous
"Prysumean" account in a New York bank, It was used to convert South
Vietnanese piasters to dollars, most of which ended up in three banks
in the shiekdom of Dubai on the Porsian Gulf.

My further investigation beyond the Comitiac probe, sabotar
lino, estadlished the dollars ware used to requisition gold ingots
from the U. S. fraasury at 335 per ounce, These were renelted to con-
yeniont "taels" or wafers of gold for black market trading for Indo-
china currencies again at huge discounts, ‘The conspirators enjoyed
govarmaeat facllities for converting plasters to dollars at fantasti-
cally unrealistic official exchange rates. The exchange provided huge
profits to conspirators and huge losses to the Treasurye

This inflation machine is still at work, though at a reduced rate since
the ond of the war in Southeast Asia. The entrepreneurs seek gxcencr
pastures where new wars destabilise currencies, Pernaps Angola?
Haukpidge's real nasa is Cornel Solyom. His intolligence activitles
for a decade were traced in a 64 page report in the possession of tha
Senate and House Intelligence Comaittees and your Committee.

Senator Ribicoff, had the activities of ClA-Crime double agent Carmine
Bellino and Hawkridge's testimony been exposed in the cuolic record in
1969, the trauma for you, for your Committers, for the Congrens and for
the American electorate would have been inereifully softened. Rellino
went on to’ become Catef Investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee.
He covered up tha souress of $1,050,000 of so-called political donor
funds I have traced. He went on to instruct CIA agent Aloxander But-
terfield in the ‘nite Houso to reveal the existonce of the President's
tapes, thereby insuring his dowfall.

A filo of my letters to Senator Henry Jackson in 1969 were sont by hin

to your Connittes, The intelligence was suporessed by Ballino., Although
your Connittes published eight volunes of hearings. in this investigation,
Hawkridgs's vital testinony was deleted. My intelligence was disregarded.

The legislative remedies now boing proposed to counter corruption of our
dntolligence services can only te made adequata by exposing to public :
view the depth of the problem of sccrceye I an alarmed at demands for

Dear Senator Church: . .

I commend the diligent efforts of you, the members and the staff in produce
ing and especially in publishing the Committes's report’on "Allaged Assasa~
ination Plots Involving Foreign Leadera,"

Nevertheless, I must advyiso you that over 200 pages of counterintalligence

on domestic and foreign assassinations of the CIA I have provided or made
available to staff and members hay been dlavegardsd or dalibovately with-
held from members. . - . .

Consequently, a3 members are preparing to sign a final report, 3t is timely ©
to list some of the disastrous errors ot the interla report. The errors

‘are the result of intentionsl misropresentation and deceit of the Congress
and the “Americun electorate by the CIA, its directors and employees.

(1) Tae ZR/RTFLE Executive Action program begun in 1960, headed by Wll}
diam Harvey, was designed’ as a damestic asgasgination capability.

(2) Under the direct planning and implamentation of Harvey, a number of
domostic and foreign assassinations were executed.

(3) Harvey's real nana ig William 5S, Wood, alias Willian Boxley, alias
W. Jd. Wwod, His assassinations in USA I have already reported.

(4) Among foroign assassinations with participation by Weed's domostic
team mesdera on foreign duty are those of Lumumba and Trujillo.

(5) Ordera passed by CIA for execution, rather than oxiling.or kidnapping,
caused the deaths of Ngo Diem, Ngo Nhu and Rene Schneidar.

(6) CIA gave the code naze WJ/MIN to the organized crise assassination
consultent employed to insure the killing of Patrice Lumumba. His
roal name is Michael Genovese, alias Vietor Resignio, son of Vito
Genovese, boss of bossea of the Mafia in Atlanta fedexal prison
until he died. Genoveas enjoyed assassination authority independen’
of CIA directora delegated by Moyer Lansky, boss of tha American
international crime syndicate then, Neithar President Eisenhower nor
Presidant Kennedy confurced as3azsination authority upon OTA.

(7) Genovese, as Victor Resignio, directed an arma and supplies diversion
and currency manipulation racket in South Vietnam in 1966-67 that cost
the Treasury $51.8 billion, Executive Departments! total, not ndnos

(8) Wood's crime team member that aided Genovese to assure Lumunbats death
was’ code named WI/NCGUE, He is Frank Sturgis, Watergate burglar.

The 1949 act authorized CIA to coneoal huge portions of its budget and

When Cornelius and Angela Hailertdge were hit by the CIA's domast tic
assassins on January 10, 1959): my ager overrode my caution, I wrote
all fifte en members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee February

~ 23, 1969. I demanded that Hawkridge be heard by the Senate. Although
I reveived no replies, this forced Caraine Bellino's hand and Hawk-
ridge was subpocnaed, The recipients referred sone letters to your
Comnittacs — 7

Six months earlier my lotter. of August 14, 1968 to the Foreign Relations
Comnittee enclosed a 606 pagejstudy entitled "Assassinations of the
Tadusteial State." It concluded with the startling preaise I am now
propared to prove to the Senate:

"It is my firm prediction! that when the Foreign Relations.
Committess get to the botton of the CIA's conspiracy to
usurp Congress! foreign policy authority. they will also
have solved the conspiracies behind the continuing
assassinations of the industrial states".

I rely upon your fairness for opportunity to refutes the clains of
William Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, to testify and to aid
your Committas to draft legislation that will effectively prevent
abuses of power by the governent!s intelligence agencies,

As an Air Force officer befora, during and after World Way II, I am
concerned, as I know you are, that our country's security will be pro-
tected. I will testify for more offective legitimate intelligence and
counterintelligence services, Perhaps the most effective testimony I
can give is that which will establish that the CIA has been thoroughly
infiltrated and corrupted by double agents who owa their prinary
loyalty to the Soviet KGB. |

Appraisal of Content:3 . i

t
1. Agents of the Servicio de Inteligencia Militar (SIM, Cuban Military Intel licence |
Service) are reported to have identified cefinitely the assassins of Lt. Cel.
Antonio BLANCO Pico, former chief of SIM killed on 22 Octcber 1956 at the Mont- coe
martre nightclub. On 29 Noverber 1956 SIM agents interrogated Dr. Armando CARDENAS =
Aranguren, ‘instructor of patholosy at the University of Eabana, end succeeded Re
in obtaining an admission fron CARDENAS that Juan Pedro CAR2O Servid end Rolarca
CUSELAS Secades‘had sought refuge at his. house after the assassinaticn of ELA‘CO
Rico and had remained there epasroximately three or four days. CARDENAS stated ;
' during interrcgation that CA839 had arrived at his house carrying a sub-rachine
. gun. On the basis of CARDENAS’ adaissions, SIM officiais are convinced that
-CAREO and CU3ELAS were the ones who killed €LANCO (Rico.

2. Implication of CARDENAS and CUSELAS resulted from the interception of a cable

by SIM sent from Miami, Florida, by a friend of CUBELAS to Virginia SECASES, bd

“ mother of CUBELAS, in Habana. On. 27 November 1956 Virginia SECADES was arrested
by SIM and taken.to SIM headquarters for questioning concerning her son's parti-
cipation in the essassination of BLANCO Rico.. SIM agents were unable to obtain
_any information from SECADES concerning her son' s role in the killing but suc-

“ ceeded in learning that CARDENAS was a close friénd of her son. On 29 November
1956 SIM agents picked up CARDENAS ,who, under pressure, admitted that he was

Sa homosexual, that CUSELAS was his intimate friend, and that he had nidden
CUBELAS and CARBO in his home for about four days. These admissions were made
at SIM headquarters in the presence of Colonel Irenaldo GARCIA Baez, deruty
chief of SIM, Lt. Col. Marcelo TASERNILLA, who was wounded during the shooting.
of BLANCO Rico, and other high sim officials.

“3. interrogation of CARDENAS failed to. reveal the destination of CARBO and CUBELAS
after they. left the home of CARDENAS. - On the basis of the intercepted cable,

4. SIM has transmitted the results of interrogation of SECADES and CARDENAS to .
President Fulgencio BATISTA, but the latter's reactign to these new cevelop-
. ments is not known, further action by the Cuban-authorities is complicated
by the fact that the Governnent's main witness, CAPRCENAS, is of dubious re-
Tiability, because of his homosexuality. CARDENAS is also reported to be
the doctor of the family of Santieco VERDESJA Neyra, Minister of Cefense, who
vouched for him when he was arrested by SIM. : :

Field Comments:

J. Office files contain no previous record of CARDENAS in connection with
anti-BATISTA activities. A Dr. Armando CARDENAS was listed 'in Hoy (cefunct
newspaper of the Cuban Cormunist Party), issue of 22 April 1949, as one
of the persons who sent greetings to the World Corgress of Peace Partisans,
scheduled to begin in Paris on 20 April 1949. :

2. Both CAR3O and CUSELAS have been the subjects in the past of denunciations
and arrests by the Cuban authorities as a result of their anti-BATISTA
activities. They were accused in August 1955 by Colonel Orlanco PIEDRA,
chief of the Department of Investigations, of having fled from the police
from the site of an arms cache. In February 1956 CUBELAS was arrested and
tried on charges of participating in student disorders, according to articles
which appeared in’ local newspapers on 15 March 1955 and 1 April 1956. CARBO
was denounced by the Cuban police as one of BLANCO Rico's killers imzediately
after the shooting incident at the Montmartre nightclub.

3. Office files contain no previous record of Virginia SECADES, Habana news- |
papers of 29 November 1956 carried an item in which the University of Habana

Student Federation protested against the detention of Virginia SECACES by
SIM. ; . a :

4 Files of the Consular Section, United States Embassy, Habana, revealed

that CARBO was issued a tourist visa on 3 June 1954 and that CUBELAS re-
ceived a similar visa on 15 October 1954. The files do not indicate :
whether these visas were valid for a single entry or multiple entries, but
they could still be valid, on the basis of the dates of issue.

rd

“5. Epa officials announced immediately after the assassination of BLANCO
' rg, <° that they had information as to the identity of the two assassins,
AIG TS Beaming CARBO but not his accomplice, and that they were on the trail of
f the latter. The police have failed to find the killers, however, and re-
CG} portedly, under pressure from President BATISTA and General Francisco
TADERHILLA, Chief of Staff, Cuban Armed Forces, SIM and the police have
been making desperate efforts to salve the BLANCO Rico killing. It is

possible that CARDENAS may have been forced by SIM interrogators to make
statements implicating CARBO and CUBELAS which were not altogether true.

: 6. The local press and radio reported on 29 and:30 Novenber 1956 that United
States authorities were looking in hew Orleans for two Cubans who were sus-
pected of being the killers of BLANCO Rico. They were identified by name as -
Rolando CUSELAS Secades and Guillermo GARCIA Riestra. The latter, wnile a
student et the University of Habana, was eccused of having participated in
an attempt against the life of Rolando MASFERRER in September 1949, accord-
ing to office files.

7. Avance, Habana-afternoon newspaper, published the official SIM version of
‘CERDENAS' arrest on 30 November 1956; other newspapers carried it subse-
quently. It contained substantially the same information as resorted —

in the assassination OF BLANCO Rico, alleging that PRIO had helped CAREO
and CUBELAS to escape from Cuba.-

SUBJECT: SSC Request : : a

REFERENCE: - RS 76-0083/A (14 January 1976)

1. Re question number 1 of reference: Attachment "A" contains
the names of Agency personnel who were in ilexico City, Mexico, during
“the period 1 September 1963 through 31 December 1963 and who are still

on duty. Attachment "B" contains the names of Agency personnel who
were in Mexico City during this same period but are now retired or no
longer on duty. It is understood that these attachments will be
retained in the Headquarters building for use by the Committee Staff.

2. Re question number 3(a) of reference: For your background,
‘the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) was a Cuban student
exile entity founded in September 1960 as an anti-Communist revolutionury
organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Castro regimes The parent
organization of the DRE was the Directorio Revolucionario (DR), a revolu-
tionary organization of Cuban students opposed to the Batista regime
which actively joined the Castro forces by organizing a guerrilla move-
ment which contributed greatly to tie collapse of the Batista regime-
The Castro government, themselves of student origin, recognized the DR
power and by-passed them politically by forming the new regime without
their participation. The original DR became Communist controlled and
directed. While the Agency had no role in the founding, the DRE was an
entity used by the CIA as a unilateral asset in pursuing U.S. policy
objectives. CIA support to the DRE ceased on 30 September 1966 and formally
terminated on 1 January 1967. At that time DRE files were reviewed and
material dealing with CIA support and operations were either destroyed
or turned over the JMWAVE Station. The DRE was expected to continue as
an organizational entity and continue its activities independent of CIA.

3. The DRE files of both Station JMWAVE and Headquarters that are

available have been reviewed and Lee Harvey Oswald's name does not appear i _
in these files. WAVE cable 8049 (in, 66782) of 22 November 1963, states te
in the third sentence, “according AMSPELL files, Oswald", undoubtedly Me. «

refers to the DRE‘files maintained in the DRE office in Miami, Florida.

E2 IMPDET
CL BY 099560

These entity files were independent of the JMWAVE Station files. Had
Station JMWAVE referred to its files in WAVE 8049 the cavle would have
been worded, "according AMSPELL Station files." The file of AMHINT-53,
a former executive of the DRE, has also been reviewed and no. reference
to Oswald was found. The file number which appears on WAVE 8049 is no
longer in use and the contents ‘of this former file were transferred
into Oswald's and other 201, files by the CI Staff. A tape of the radio
debate cited in WAVE 8049 is included in the Oswald 201 held by the CI
Staff. i

4, Re question number 3(b) of reference: We have been’unable to
determine if Station JMWAVE was instructed to review its files for
information on Oswald. For many years the CI Staff has been the focal
point for tne collation of any: and all information concerning Oswald
and if the JMWAVE files on any Cuban groups contained information on
Oswald such information should be reflected in Oswald 201 file.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Jim Johnston ; Paul Wallach

FROM: Dan Dwyer :

DATE : January 21, 1976

SUBJ: ©. GIA Briefing with Raymond Rocca Regarding Oswald:

Early in our investigation of CIA's handling of the Oswald case,
Raymond Rocca briefed Wallach, Dwyer and Greissing on November 11 and
13, 1975. Some of Rocco's: comments merit consideration in | Light of
our present knowledge of the case.

oi. Opening of 201

Rocca explained that Oswald’ s 201 was opened by Betty Egerter::
from a list of American defectors 1958-1960 from the State Department.”

2. Status of 201, 11/22/63

Rocca explained that @mNovember 22, 1963 all documents in the
~~. Oswald 201 were originated by other agencies; Mexico City cable
“Paktic was not included in, the 201 because it was routed through
a lcompartmentalized channel: and. therefore would not be circulated

_via™the 201. ji
|
3. Oswald's De fection to! USSR

With regard to Oswald"s defection to the Soviet Union, Rocca
said Oswald would have been, of interest to the military and the FBI
and that CIA was only interested in the “information” aspect of the
case. Rocca could not cite’ any. example of a U.S. citizen defecting
on behalf of any interest of the U.S. government.

With regard to the Hoover" memorandum. of June 3, 1960 raising
the possibility that an imposter could be using Oswald's birth certifi-
cate, Rocca believed Hoover. would not have generated it. Rocca sug-~
. gested someone at the Bureau who was familiar with Soviet technique
of using birth certificates for illegals -- Larry McWilliams, Brannigan
‘or Cregar -- would have authored the memo. (Rocca could never establish
if, in fact, Oswald took his birth certificate with him to the Soviet
Union. ) Rocea: commented that the Bureau memo, sent to State and ONI,
should have been forwarded to CLA by State, but never was.

In Rocca's determination, Oswald was the only American defector
who was allowed to stay in Russia following a suicide attempt. Rocca
said that Oswald would have. been subjected to one or two assessments
by the KGB.

HW 50955 Doold:32423630. Page 574
Rocca referred to an SB study, direéted by Lee Wigren and con-
ducted by Virginia Valpi which compared the Oswald case to other U.S.
defectors and their wives. ‘SB concluded. Oswald was not given special
‘handling by the KGB. Rocca-maintains Oswald was given special treat-
ment. He believes Oswald's relationship with the "Red Cross" (from
which Oswald received finandial assistance) and the Red Cross' relation-
ship with the KGB should be:\clarified.

Rocca also finds it peculiar that Marina married Oswald since
Marina's uncle was KGB. Rocca said that Oswald was the only defector
who married someone with a KGB connection of that kind. Rocca said that
the CIA developed this information after the assassination.

Rocca described Minsk as "not an unsensitive section" of Russia
and added that Oswald was the only American defector in Minsk, a white
Russian area. :

Rocca commented on Oswald! s.surprise visit to the American Em-
bassy in Moscow by saying that | ‘people don't do that kind of thing
in Russias’

Rocca believes Oswald's Soviet - diary is bona fide.. “Rocea ad-
mitted that although there are perceptible changes in the quality
of Oswald's written material, Oswalds' mentality seemed: conducive -
to periods of attention to thoroughness and detail.

4. Alleged Debriefing of Oswald

Rocca did not have any knowledge of an alleged debriefing of
Oswald in New York City by the DCD. Rocca said that if a debriefing
report existed, it would have been distributed in 00 series (overt
operations) of the DDI (mow DDO). Rocca also noted that a debriefing
report would not have been filed in the Oswald 201. Rocca noted that
a Dr. Froyn (phonetic) supervised DDI records. Rocca also said that-
Traveler's Aid was a legitimate charitable organization which had 1 no
ties with the CIA.

5. ° Oswald and Mexico City - |.
Rocca said that Chief, WH could clarify aspects of technical

' operations on Cuban and Soviet Embassies. Rocca said that David
Phillips organized the technical surveillance.

Y

Although the Cuban Embassy was officially closed on September
28, Rocca found nothing unusual about Oswald's visit there and meeting
Silvi ‘Duran, Cuban consulate employee.

Rocca emphasized that ‘Oswald’ s activities in Mexico City were
the responsibility of the FBI.

HW 50955 .DocId: 32423630 Page 575
6. . Possible Oswald-Cuban! Connections

‘Rocea described document gaps in the materials that the Russian
and Cuban governments forwarded to the WC via ayPromatic channels,
He described these areas as “open and relevant.'

. Rocca drew attention to Oswald's Marine duty in California in
1958. Basing most of his analysis on testimony of DelGado, Oswald's
sergeant in California, Rocca maintained that Oswald had made contact
with the Cubans at the Cuban Embassy in Los Angeles. Rocca said that
DelGado had to release Oswald. from guard duty because someone from Los
Angeles reinitiated contact while Oswald was on duty.

. Rocca placed specific.emphasis on Castro's"impromptu "comments

to Harker.at the Brazilian Embassy in Havana yon September 7, 1963

Rocca viewed Castro's comments as a "message" to American leaders

and said it was a "very important signpost,’ ' Rocca added that the.
Mexico City Station brought Castro's comments to Headquarter’ s atten-
tion on 11/25/63. Rocca also viewed Castro's comments in terms of
Oswald's possible perception of them, since New Orleans Times Picayune
ran the Harker article on September 9, 1963. (This is the Tine Slawson
adopted: could Oswald have’ read the piece?) ;

‘In regard to the Castro comments (unfortunately my notes are
sketchy here) Rocca refers to a 10/24/63 cable, memo, or letter from
"Des. to Paris." He then refers to an 11/5/63 memo for the record and
said "man never heard from again. Rocca should be: asked to clarify

these references. :

Rocca briefly outlined Cuban-Russian relations in the early 1960s.
he described 1961 as the "seed time'’ between Cuba and the USSR. Rocca
said that following the missile crisis, the KGB and DGI began a "pre-
liminary relationship.'' Rocca mentioned Srotoff (phonetic) and
Alexiev (sic) as being KGB principals involved. Rocca said that when
Castro visited Moscow in June-July 1963, Alexiev and Leonoff served
as liaison between Kruschev and Castro. Rocca referred to an escalation
of Alpha-66 activity (sporadic. revolutionary attacks on Cub an ports ,
vessels, etc.) in July-August 1963. Rocca places Castro's “warning!
of September 7, 1963 in the context of these activities.

. Rocea said that Oswald’: s activities for the FPCC in New Orleans
were apparently self-motivated. Rocca added, however, that V. T. Lee,
national chairman of the FPCC, visited Cuba in 1964. Rocca noted that
‘(fnu) Hernandez handled Lee's case and that Hernandez’ office was next
to Azcue's, who, according to Duran, argued with Oswald at the Cuban
Embassy in "Mexico City. According: to Rocca, Hernandez was mentioned
in penetration reports from Guatemala where Hernandez was running two
DGLI agents. Rocca outlined these relationships briefly to demonstrate
_DGI-FPCC connections. Rocca concluded that the Warren Commission should
have paid more attention to; /the DGL. Rocca also mentioned that the
CIA picked up a DGI defector named Mugg in April or May of 1964, who.
was handled by WH Division.

HW 50955 DocId:32423630 Page 576.
7. Oswald, New Orleans, Garrison Case

Rocca said that the cI/R and A stayed on top of the Garrison case
and "summarized overt developments.” Rocca identified the analyst
for the Garrison material as Donald Pratt. Rocca said that by NSA
intercepts and associated relationships, the CIA believed Garrison
was operating (unwittingly) under KGB manipulation... (Rocca briefly
described Soviet technique of misinformation. He recalled an inter-
view that Drew Pearson had with Kruschev in Cairo in 1964 or 1965.
Kruschev told Pearson that his "gut feeling" was that American right-
wing extremists and capitalists were responsible for thePresident's
assassination. Rocca said this typified KGB disinformation.)

Rocca characterized Oreste Pena's allegations as "absolute
fabrication." Rocca said CIA files revealed that. Clay Shaw was. a
contact of the DCD until 1956. 4

Rocca said that he was never informed in 1962. or 1963 about
a revolutionary training camp around Lake Pontchartrain. He believes
that the GIA did not know of: its existence. Rocca said there is evi-
dence that messages from the Lake Pontchartrain camp were going to a
drop in Mexico City.

8.. GPFLOOR ‘Period

GPFLOOR was the crypt ‘used to describe the investigation con-
ducted by CIA following the President's assassination (11/23-1/12- 15/63. ):
The Mexico City aspect of GPFLOOR was controlled by WH: J. C. King,
Chief; Jack Whiten, Desk Chief, and Win Scott, COS, Mexico City. Rocca

_ said that Whiten would report Mexico City developments to Helms who -
would then inform McCone.

9. . End_of GPFLOOR: Warren Commission

With the formation of ‘the Warren Commission, the GPFLOOR period
ended. Rocca explained that Helms served as the major liaison between
the CIA and WC. Rocca served as chief of research for matters of in-
terest to the WC -- mostly concerning Oswald's defection to Russia.
-Rocea's staff included: Thomas Hall, Arthur Dooley and Paul Hartman.
“Hall conducted research on Soviet service in DDO. Dooley followed all
Bureau developments forwarded to CIA. Hartman was responsible for ex- |
ploration of overt references and Soviet service. Additionally, Hartman
researched DeMohrenschildt' s relationship to the Oswalds.

Rocca reported his research staff's findings to Angleton; Rocca
had no contact with Helms. ‘Rocca explained that he had some liaison
with Slawson of the WC staff. Rocca said that any negotiation between
the CIA and WC was conducted by Helms, Dulles, and Rankin. -Rocca said
he had no knowledge of any CIA assassination attempts against Castro.

; - Rocca emphasized that the FBI was the investigative arm for the
Warren Commission. Rocca said that Sam Papich, Dick O'Niell (sic) and
Jim Hunt were the Bureau personnel involved with the. WC.

HY 50955 DocId: 32423630 Page 57?
HW 50955 DoclId: 32423630 Page. 576 ~

Rocca said that additional research’ in CI was “conducted by.
David Murphy and Bagley, Chief and Deputy: Chief of CI/SB. Rocca
said that Lee Wigren and Virginia Valpi were also involved in
Soviet R&A. |

10. Rockefeller Commission Inquiry

Rocea served as. CIA liaison to the Rockefeller Commission
in regard to Warren Commission allegations. Belin and Robert Olsen
were involved in the investigation. Belin wanted Rocca to review
documentation regarding the'!photo of the unidentified individual
in Mexico City. Belin told: Rocca that the Warren Commission was not
clued in on Cuban emigreeissues and Operation MONGOOSE. Rocca de-
veloped the impression that the Rockefeller Commission was looking
into CIA's operations aimed’ at Castro. Belin asked Rocca for the —
Castro comments of September 7, 1963. Belin was not aware of the
statements during the Warren Commission. (Slawson, however, was but
only at the conclusion of the WC.)-

Rocca also said that Belin is writing another book on Oswald
and the President! s assassination.

I then got a call from Bundy on october 2nd, and he said

i
that -- Chase, I think his name was, ‘Peter Chase, one of his
assistants -- is the person to be ain with, and to keep
him apprised of all developments. —~__ .

I later, again got'a word from Jean Daniel, the’ French *:
. |
correspondent who had come back from Havanna saying Cuba seemed
ripe for a conversation. So this aisp came from another source,
a Greek town planner named Doxiati;,,. who said that Castro was

very much interested in some kind of normalization relation,

but that’ Che Guevera and Raul. were opposed.

October 2ist, I got a call again from Bundy's office asking
me what was new. I said, well the ball is now. in the Cuban's
court. ~~ : | .

On the 28th, I saw Tochuga again at the UN who said that
Havanna didn't see exactly how a talk would be useful now, but
he would be glad to maintain continuous contact with me anyway.

The 4th of November I briefed Stevenson on these develop~ .
ments and meanwhile, Miss Howard had been on the ‘Phone with
Rene Valao who was Fidel. Castro! s aide at that point, and who

was one of the so-called pro-Americans in the group and who

suggested that I get in touch with him by telephone.

i

I then briefed Bundy on this:om the Sth of November

Bundy told me that the President was fore in. favor of pushing

towards an opening toward Cuba than was the State Department,

‘the idea being -- well, getting them out of the Soviet fala and

I reported this to Bundy on the; 19th of November ~~ by the

way, my call to Valao: was the 18th -- he said that after their

agenda had been received, the President wanted to see me at the

we should do next. That was the 19th of November, three days

before the assassination. : .

On the 29th of Novembar, LaChuga had seen: Miss Howard
and he wondered where things stood now. I passed the word to
him that I didn't know, but that until we were told differently
that we would continue our conversation.

On the and of December he confirmed. getting a letter from
Valao and hae wanted to know if «things nad changed again. He
said he was authorized to talk to me in general terms,

the ball was now in our court. . |
On December 4th, LaChuga again looked me up at the UN;
said he now had a Latter directly from Castro approving the

detailed talks and an agenda. Again, I informed Chase.

He said the decision would take some time now because all
our policies were under review.

This went on. I kept seaing LaChuga and LaChuga would say
he was waiting for an answer, and I kapt saying well: the door

memo recapitulating the events or the discussions in the fall
with interest and that was that. And I then was in Washington.
Averell Harriman asked me about the Cuban project. I said I
didn't know, that it was lying down in Chase's office in the
White House and that he told me he'd get back to me after the
holidays.

Well, that ended my diary in ‘63. TI then went to Kenya

some time in January I again called Chase and I said, well, if

this thing is going to be continued I would suggest either
John Case or someone on that mission. He said, well, it doesn't
look as though it's going to be continued now because it's an
election year, or whatever the reason was, and anyway we'll keep
it in mind but that it was a dead issue.

The interesting thing, I think in terms of your investiga
tion is that whatever “was going on in terms of assassination
plots, certainly ther’ seemed to. be two tracks, because it seems
hard for me to believe that the Executive would be approving thi
type of negotiation while other covert oparations were happening},

Subject: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS RELATING
TO PLOTS TO ASSASSINATE CASTRO

On May 20, 1975, I reviewed one file of documents
in the office of the Assistant Attorney General/Criminal
Division. The file was about one-half inch thick, was marked
-"#82-46-5 —- TOP SECRET." It contained documents relating to
the October 31, 1960, wiretapping incident in Las Vegas.

‘fhe documents in this file indicated the following
items of interest: :

1. The IRS investigated Rosselli from December 1, 1962, to
March 1, 1963. :

2. IRS report attached to March 19, 1963, memo to Herbert J.
Miller, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
‘Indicates Maheu told FBI that Rowan tap had been placed
to determine whether McGuire had leaked any classified
information she had obtained from Giancana.

3. Letter from Miller (Assistant Attorney General) to U.S.
Attorney in Las Vegas of January 17, 1963, instructed ~

that prosecution of Balletti should be dropped.

4. Memo for the Record, dated May 14, 1962, Subject: arthur
James Balletti et al - Unauthorized Publication or Use of

Memo to Attorney General, from Herbert J. Miller, of
April 24, 1962, Subject: Arthur James Balletti - Wiretap

Case ~ Sam Giancana - This memo recommends prosecution in
this case would be against national interest. It contains
no mention of assassination.

The file contained several memos to and from FBI Director
and Miller of January, February, and March, 1962, re
Las Vegas case. They did not mention assassination.

Other Department of Justice documents of December 1961,
relating to possible prosecution were filed. They basically

“outlined facts of the Balletti matter.

FBI reports on Las Vegas incident, dated September 12,
1961, August 18, 1961, and July 28, 1961... The last one
indicated Maheu installed bug to determine whether
Giancana had leaked classified information to McGuire.

There follow several FBI reports on interview during 1961
of participants in the Las Vegas incident.

Memo from Director of FBI to Attorney General, of May 22,
1961, transmits the memo dated May 22, 1961, oF an inter-

view with Shef Edwards of May 3, 1961. [We have copy of
the memo on this interview, dated May 22, 1961, Subject:
“Arthur James Balletti, et al."]

FBI report (April 20, 1961) of interview with Maheu.
It indicates Maheu said he ordered bug to determine if

Giancana or McGuire were leaking information.

There follow many FBI documents in 1961 on investigation _
of details of preparation, etc., for Las Vegas affair.

Memo, dated November 22, 1960, to Assistant Attorney
General (Criminal Division), from Director of FBI,

Subject: Arthur James Balletti, Unauthorized Publication
or Use of Communications transmitted a report of an FBI
agent at Salt Lake City dated November 10, 1960. The
agent's report stated that Balletti was arrested on
October 31, 1960, at the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas. This

“report contains the details of the arrest.

file on the Las Vegas Incident.)

14. Documents from late 1960's and early 1961 indicate Maheu
did not implicate CIA initially but instead said he had
been asked by a Los Angeles attorney to arrange investi-

gative work in Las Vegas. Maheu declined to name the
attorney. :

Maheu first mentioned CIA connection in an FBI interview
on April 18, 1961 [after the Bay of Pigs] (detailed in an
agent report of April 20, 1961, transmitted by a memo to
Assistant Attorney General on April 25, 1961). He said
he was working with CIA and the Las Vegas bug was ordered
to determine if Sam Giancana was leaking information.
(Maheu did not tell FBI about nature of activities he
undertook for CIA.)

WASHINGTON—A fantastic tale of attempted Cuban espionage involving
Chicago gang boss Momo Salvatore (Moc) Giancana and the Central Intelli-
gence Agency was revealed Thursday to The Sun-Times.

Giancana never did any spying
al all for the CIA.:

Giancana, according to these
sources, merely pretended to
go along with the CIA in the
hope that the Justice Depart-
ment's drive to put him behind
bars might be slowed—or at
least affected—by his ruse of
co-operation with anuther gov-
ernment agency,

If this was Giancana’s mo-
tive. his scheme was a failure.

But Justice Department
sources expressed belief that

Chicago led directly to the ex-
posure of the La Cosa Nostra
(“our cause”) brotherhood and
the Commission.

With his connections in

Cuba, Giancana declared he
would be able to sneak intel-
ligence out of the island for
the CIA, *
* A high government source
gave The Sun-Times this ac-
count of how Giancana stepped
into the rele of a government

The CIA made its first con-

Commission, in traditional gang
bipartisanship, had — dollars ,

Cuban revolt:

The Commission was said to
have given financial backing to
Castro—only to have him shut
down the gambling casinos.

And the former Cuban dic-
tater, Fulgencio Batista, re+
portedly fled Cuba with mil-
lions he received from Com-
mission hoodlums. ;

In his dickering with the
CIA, Giancana reputedly boast-
ed that he had contacts with

“CONFIDENTIAE
COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

_Weshington, © DC 20500 : 2
May 21,1975 C Pa ae
MEMORANDUM !
To: File
From: Mason Cargill Me ae a .

Subject: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOCUMENTS

On the afternoon of May 20, 1975, I briefly
examined the Justice Department files on the Kennedy assassi-
nation, ranging from February 18, 1969, to January 28, 1971.
According to Mr. Keeney and his secretary who has reviewed

these files in detail, they contain no memo from any State

Department employee who was in Mexico in 1963. Basically these
files consist of letters from citizens, some referred from
congressmen, and press clippings relating to the assassination.

Mr. Keeney's secretary referred me to several
entries in these files respecting allegations by people who
claimed to have been involved in the Kennedy assassination.
One claimed to have been a CIA agent. There are also many
letters from assassination "nuts." Other documents relate
to court proceedings to force FBI agents to testify in the

- Clay Shaw trial in Louisiana.

One document: is ‘an FBI report, dated February 2,
1972, stating that one Richard von Kleist had contacted the
‘FBI claiming he had information on. the John F. Kennedy .
assassination. Kleist claimed certain people conspired in
the Hotel Luna, Mexico City, in July, 1963. Kleist was not
a State Department employee. . He appeared to be a free-lance
magazine writer. : ; : :

:

ze: Assassination of the President

“that before looking at the FBI as to possible "leaks, " he should carefully examine his
own house. I told him I wag quite thoroughly familiar with the way Guthman and
.Rosenthal dealt with the press and that as he well knew the wire service people stayed
‘constantly in Guthman's private office.; I told him it was quite obvious to me how the
AP had learned that the report had been sent over to the Department,

. Katzenbach reiterated that he had no complaints against the FBI. He
stated again that the purpose of his call was to tell me about Senator Russell's feelings.

He added that he had another reason for calling and that was to determine
if we could give him any ideas as to how Warren Olney could be dropped as Chief
Counsel of*the Presidential Commission. I told Katzenbach of our feelings concerning

‘Olney. He. stated that‘he was presently: working through Congressman Hale Boggs and
ihe thought he was going to pe successful in getting Olney's name removed from
| consideration, He told me that Boggs was very sympathetic.

i Katzenbach mentioned that Waggoner Carr, the Texas State Attorney

General, would like very much to see the Director on Friday, 12-6-63, I asked him

“what for. He stated that Carr had no‘particular motive in mind other than to indicate

to the press later on that he had discussed matters with the Director. I told him I could
see no percentage in the Director's seeing Carr, that we were the investigative

‘agency and that Carr's dealings should be with the Department and the Presidential
Commission. Katzenbach indicated that the White House might think otherwise. He
stated that the President was most anxious for Carr to be given attention in Washington
inasmuch as Cagr was running for office next year. Itold Katzenbach I knew this,
howéveér, I still felt that the Director should not be injected into this matter.
Katzenbach stated he would attempt to disuadée Carr from seeing the Director, however,
‘Carr was quite persistent. - :

ACTION: .
Ty view of the close friendship which Carr obviously has withthe = yaaa
President, the Director may desire to just shake hands with Carr without sitting down
and discussing facts concerning our report. ; {

dous help to the President's Commission, that an extremel larze voluse of "7

_ ~ He commented that recently there had been quite an increase in the ws
that there would be many more =

number of requests and there was a possibility
additional requests. Mr, Rankin’ stated this was not intended as a criticisu
of the Bureau's work but instead: was the following through of the Commis-
cion's desire-to complete the Commission's record and leave no unanswered

questions

In this. regard, fir. Rankin went on to say that the Bureau, in.
conducting its investigation had an extrenely difficult and enormous tisk
to perform and that he as weil as other members of the Comaission staff had.
been amazed at the amount of detailed information which had been developed
by the Bureau in its investigation, We commented that the Commission in. -
performing its tasks was of necessity making a most minute study of the ~ =
Bureau's work as well as that of other Government asencies with the idea of. | |
picking the investigation to pieces to the extreme degree so that wherever 4
it was possible to clarify any item, this could be handled while the ; -:
Commission was in existence. : ‘ fe

Mr, Rankin advised that in connection with the letter which had oo
just recently Qcen transmitted to the Bureau requesting an explanation con-
cerning information relative to Special Agent Janes P. Hosty's name being
omitted from a report prepared in the Dallas Office (report of Special Agent: |

that Agent. Ilosty's name appeared in the book along with the office telephone

to the Comission (dated 1/27/64) set forth full information for. the. —

An Extract From Kennedy's Address to Press’ ;
Washington Post, Tuesday, November IJ, 1963, p. Al5
(AP). Nov. 18 -- The following is a text of President Kennedy's address
tonight before the Inter-American Press Association:

oo * *
“The genuine Cuban revolution -- because it was against the tyran-
ny and corruption of the past -- had the support of many whose aims and

concepts were noble.
"But that hope for freedom and progress was destroyed.
"The goals proclaimed! in the Sierra Maestra were betrayed in Havana.

"It is important to restate what now divides Cuba from my country
and from all the American lcountries: It is the fact that a small band
of conspirators has strippéd the Cuban people of their freedom and hand-
ed over the independence and sovereignty of the Cuban nation to forces
beyond the hemisphere. ‘They have made Cuba a victim of foreign imperial-
ism, an instrument of the policy of others, a weapon in an effort dic-
tated by external powers to; subvert the other American republics. This,
and this alone divides us;}/' As long as this is true nothing is possible.
Without it everything is possible. . ; ;
.t

Ready and Anxious

"Once this barrier is) removed we will be ready and anxious to work
with the Cuban people in pursuit of those progressive goals which, a few
short years ago, stirred their hopes and the sympathy of many people
throughout the entire hemilsphere. :

:

"No Cuban need feel trapped between dependence on the broken prom-
ises of foreign communism |and the hostility of the rest of the hemisphere.
For once. Cuban sovereignty,has been restored we will extend the hand of
friendship and assistance,|to a Cuba whose political and economic insti-
tutions have been shaped by. the will of the Cuban people."

Unoffi

cial Envoy
An Historic Rebor' from Two Capitals

-—

A recent trip. to the United St ies, fol lowed by a jorrney to Cuba, made it

possible for me to establish a “di
Prime Minister Fidel Castro. Sint

gue” betiwoun the late President Kennedy and
ny arrival in Mexico, where this article is

being written, | have been, asked nohether the impressions I derived from these
interviews could shed any light on the assassination of the President and on

future relations between Lynd

B. Johnson and Castro.

Last week in these pages | answered the first question by describing the re-

actions of Fidel Castro, with dbhon I was visiting at the time, te John. Ken-

_ nedu’s death, Here T shall explore the second question by reconstituting the
Kennedy- Castro dialogue from iste viewpoint of one who was a witress to it.

oa
President Kennedy received me at the White. House
on Trucsday. October 24. My appointment had been
scheduled for 5:30. I waited in the Cabinet Conference

“oem, and at 5:45 the President, following his usual
custom, came to look for me himself so that he’ could
escort me into his office. He apologized for the. delay,
not so much as a courtesy or to flatter me, but to ex~
plain the scheduling of his time, which seemed to be
very strictly organized. As we passed through the small
room where. his secretary was working, we catight a
glimpse of Mrs. Kennedy leaving by a French window

n her way to the private garden of the White House.
The President called her back to introduce me.::

"It was. still Indian summer in Washington. i The
weather was very warm, and both the President and
Mrs Kennedy were very lightly dressed, thus enhanc-
ing the impression of youth, charm, and simplicity
which was in rather surprising contrast to the solemnity

of entering these august chambers.. The President.

(athletic looking in his well-tailored suit, speaking: with
quick, abrupt gestures and a mobile expression but, at
times, freezing up and becoming disconcertingly, al-
most, | would say, completely expressionless) ‘invited
me to be seated on the semi-circular sofa which was in
the middle of his office. He sat ina rocking chair op-
_ posite the sofa. The interview was to last from zo to 25
minutes, and it was interrupted only by a brief. tele-
phone call. .
The President immediately asked me how the French
situation was developing. After my reply, h¢ spoke
about General de Gage. He talked in a relaxed fashion,

THe AUTHOR

like someone who has at last found solace in indiffer-
ence after having long been exasperated and fascinated.
John Kennedy was a iian who liked to get to the heart
of.a matter quickly, “Siabmake decisions even more
rapidly. But this was not possible in dealing with de
Gaulle, who is more difficult to handle than Khru-
shchev. One day, impatient at not understanding the
General’s reasoning and intent upon convincing him,
Kennedy telephoned de Gaulle direct All in’ vain. Odd-
ly enough, however, since the recent visit of de Gaulle’s

foreign, minister, Couve de Murville, to Washington

Mr. Kennedy had ceased to be so deeply concerned
about Franco-American relations. The truth is, he had
made up hig mind not to worry about them any more.
According to him, it was a waste of time.

“Mr. Couve de Murville and | both verified that we
didn’t agree on anything,” the President told me. “And
we agreed that,such total disagreement was hardly cal-
culated to create a flourishing friendship between two
great Western nations. I came to the conclusion that
General de Gaulle’s strategy, which is: rather incom-
prehensible to me, requires a certain amount of tension
with the United States. It would seem that only through
this tension is it possible to restore to Europ. the desire
to, think for itself and renounce its torpi endence
on American dollar aid and political guida .

President Kennedy went on to sum
ciseness and vigor, the points of disayre
the United States and France. On the <
many, nuclear policy, Europe, the :1

knowledye. He added, however, that France had
strange way of manifesting its independence, part.c-
ularly, for example, on the subject of jVietnam and
Cuba. It seemed ironic and irritating tovhim that the
French Chief Executive was apparently. bent on telling
him how the Unised States should proceed, without
assuming any risks himself. Fle told me that no one was
more appreciative than he of advice, information, and
even criticism; but that these were all the more valued

mitted to a program of action. .

I then asked Mr. Kennedy what could be expected
from General de Gaulle’s proposed visitlto the United
States next February. He replicd: ’ “Absolutely nothing.”
But he followed this up immediately and with a broad
grin, as though savoring in advance the pleasure of
the impending meeting: “Tt will be exciting, just the
same. General de Gaulle is an historic figure; he is de-
cidely the strangest great man of our jtime.”’

if the friends proffering them were io com--

Relations with Cuba

Taking the initiative at this point, I brought up the

subject of Vietnam and Cuba, saying, that the Gaullists
were not the only ones in France who deplored certain
mistaken US policies. | pointed out that the first time
Thad the opportunity of meeting John Kennedy, he
was a Senator and had just made a resounding speech
on the subject of Algeria. 72 Mmthe ideds set forth in
that speech been faithfully applied i in Saigon and
Havana? Here my notes are very specific, and I shall
let the late President speak through thefn: .

“We haven't enough time to talk ‘bout Vietnam,
but I'd like to talk to yeu about Cuba. Incidentally, our
conversation will be much more interesting when you
return, because Ben Bradlee [of Newsweek] tells me
you are on your way to Cuba now. ;

“Every now and then T read articles in the European
press pointing out that we Americans | were blind to
what was happening in the Cuban situation. T have just
learned that General de Gaulle himself regarded’ Com-
munism in Cuba as nothing but the| hecidental and
temporary form of a will to independence from the
United States. Of course it is very.easy| to understand
this ‘Swill to independence’ around President de Gaulle.”

John Kennedy then mustered all his persuasive force.
He punctuated each sentence with that jbrief, mechan-
ical gesture which had become famous:
~ “T tell you this: we know perfectly:

in Cuba, to the misforsemre of all, From the beginning

policies during the Batista regime. | believe that we
created, built and manufactured the Castro movement
out of whole cloth and without realizing it. I believe
that the accumulation of these mistakes has jeopardized
all of Latin America. The great aim of the Alliance for
Progress is to reverse this unfortunate policy. This is
one of the most, if not the most, important problems in
American foreign policy. I can assure you that I have
understood the Cubans. I approved the proclamation

which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, when *

he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to
rid Cuba of corruption. I will go even further: to -some
extent it is as. though Batista was the incarnation of a
number of sins on the part of the United States. Now
we'shall have to pay for those.sins. In the matter of the
Batista regime, f am in agreement with the first Cuban
revolutionaries. That is perfectly clear.”

After a silence during which he was able to note my
surprise and my interest, the President continued: “But
it is also clear that the problem has ceased to be a
Cuban one, and has become international — that is, it
has become a Soviet problem. | am the President of the
United States and not a sociologist; I am the President
of a free nation which has certain responsibilities in the
Free World. I know that Castro betrayed the promises
made in the Sierra Maestra, and that he has agreed to
be a Soviet agent in Latin America. ] know that through
his fault'— either his ‘will to independence’, his unad-
ness or Communism — the world was on the verge of
nuclear war in October, 1962. The Russians understood
this very well, at least after our reaction; but.so far as
Fidel Castro. is concerned, I must say I don’t know
whether he realizes this, or even if he cares about it.’
A smile, then: ”
you come back. In any case, the nations of Latin Amer-

way, I mean through Communist subversion. They
won't get there by going from economic oppressidn to
a Marxist dictatorship which Castro himself denounced

a few years ago. The United States now has pos-
sibility of doing as much good in Latin Ame as it
has done wrong in the past; I would even sa twe
alone have this power — on the essential cond hat

Giancana. Because of the} fvents that followed we never

reached the point of bringing before the Committee the ques-
tion of whether Giancana should be subpoenaed to testify.
After the initial phone call from Bennett to Shea, I
telephoned Bennett on two’ different occasions. My telephone a
contact with. Bennett was for the purpose of our locating
Giancana and a telephone number at which I could reach him.
Bennett initially | indicated to me, as described earlier in
this memorandum, that Giahcana was in the hospital. My recol-
lection is that on “my second telephone ‘call with Bennett, he
‘informed me that Giancana: was now out of the hospital and

staying at the Warwick Hotel. Finally, I recall calling the.

Methodist Hospital in Houston and asking to speak to Mr.

Giancana. I recall that the hospital authorities indicated —
that they had no such person by that name in the hospital.

I do not recall the precise ‘date of this telephone communication

to the hospital. It is ny recollection that the name used by
_Giancana was Doc Brown. iam uncertain whether Bennett told me

Giancana was using "Doc Brown" at both the hospital and the

hotel, but I believe he said that the alias was used at the

hospital. Bennett advised. that Giancana had been visited by

. yb . .
several relatives and gave'me the names of a@uple of persons

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 636

who he thought were Giarléana's sons-in- law. The only name

= oe ome

I remember is that of Tilsci.

In either the seco r possibly a.third conversation

with Bennett, he told meithat Giancana had now. checked out
f

of the hotel and was, either on his way back’ to his home in

Oak Park, Illinois, or with his daughter in California. He —
“provided me with the telephone number of the daughter in
California and suggested I obtain Giancana's home number from
the information directory, in Illinois.

The telephoné conversations with Bennett occurred, to
the best of my recollection, during the week of June 16, 1975.
It is possible, however, that the first conversation occurred

later in the week of June: 9. It is my recollectimthat my

second telephone conversation with Bennett occurred on Thurs-

day June 19. In any event, I am certain that I attempted to-
contact Giancana by telephone on Thursday, June 19. I was
unable to. get anyone. to answer the telephone in California
and did not have an opportunity ‘to attempt ‘to obtain the.
Iilinois number. I learned Friday, June 20 that Giancana had

been shot and killed in his home in Oak Park, Illinois on:

the evening of June 19.

Long .before his recent murder,
John Rosselli, the CIA's underworld
recruit in attempts to kill Fidel Cas-
tro, had been privately claiming that
agents of the Cuban premier, in‘ retali-
,ation, were involved in the assassina-
‘tion of President John F. Kennedy. ©

Rosselli’s belief in a-Cuban connec-

tion to the Kennedy assassination was-

:expressed through his attorney, Ed-
ward P. Morgan, to the FBI as long.
ago as March, 1987, and also in private.
,conversations with a longtime associ-
ate of Rosselli who’ participated in
meetings between Rosselli ‘and the
CIA. os

: an FBI “blind “memorandum” on
-an interview with Morgan | dated.
March 21, 1967, was included, without -

identification of the interviewee, in.
last June’s Senate Intelligence Com-°

mittee’s report on the role of the in-

telligence community in the Kennedy

assassination investigation.

Morgan told -the FBI that Rosselli
and another Morgan client had in-
formed him that Castro became aware
of CIA assassination conspiracies
against him and “thereafter employed
teams of individuals who were dis-

> patched to the United States for the .
purpose of assassinating Mri Ken: .

counted at the time it was published }

in June, before. Rosselli’s disappear-

- ance and the subsequent discovery of
his body in an oil drum in Florida
waters. The Washington Post,. however,
has confirmed that Morgan.and Rosselli
. were the sources of the testimony, that

Because neither. Morgan nor Ros- |
selli was identified in the Senate re--
port, the significance of that portion '

suggested a Cuban role in:. -the Ken- .

nedy murder.

Morgan’s account, | according; to a
summary of the FBI interview, ‘was.
that Rosselli had reached his conclu-
sion about a Cuban connection to the:
Kennedy assassination: from
“feedback” furnished by sources close
to Castro who were involved in the CIA
plots to assassinate the Cuban leader.

: to:

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 636

“this (Morgan’s) clients were aware
of the identity of some of the individ-
uals whe came to the United States
for this purpose and he understood
that two such individuals were now in
the state of New Jersey,” the FBI in-

. terview summary stated. .

A long-time associate. of Rosselli-

who was interviewed separately’ by
‘ The Washington Post, said there was
‘no question in the slain mobster’s

:mind that President Kennedy was -

‘killed on Castro’s behalf in reprisal

‘for the CIA schemes against the Cu-.

ban leader..

“He was positive; he was sure.” said
, the associate, who knew Rosselli well
_and was in contact with him before
Rosselli disappeared from his Florida
‘home on July 28. The associate, who
‘ does not want to be identified pub-
; licly, is scheduled to be interviewed
; this week by Dade County, Fla.. homi-
‘cide detectives. He was a party to Ros-
‘selli’s contacts in the early. 1960s with
.CIA case officers overseeing the at-
_ tempts to assassinate Castro. '
Despite occasional speculation, the
collective conclusion of all official
U.S. government investigations into
- the Kennedy assassination—including
- the Warren Commission, the FBI and
the CIA~-has been that there was no
evidence: that implicated the Castro
: government ov any of its agents.
However, the CIA’s inyolvement in
.the schemes to assassinate Castro
-was not divulged to the Warren Com-
mission, and knowledge of them was
confined until 1967 to a small, elite
circle of the U. 'S. intelligence commu-
i nity.” President Johnson apparently
‘first learned about the schemes only
after a March 7, 1967, column by the
ilate Drew Person, whieh prompted

‘Johnson.to order a CIA investigation

‘of the highly sensitive episode.”
Full details of the ClA-underworld

‘collusion in the plots to kill Castro .

did not surface publicly until the pub-
‘lication last year of the Senate Intelli-
‘gence Committee’s assassination re:
port and the ensuing report last June
_on the possible role of the intelligence _

tet
agencies in the Kennedy assassination ,

and investigation.
The body of Rosselli, who lived
flamboyantly in a world of mobsters, .

politicians and playgirls, was found .

two weeks ago in an inverted of] drum
,weighted with chains but buoyed by :
* gases from decomposition on the
{ocean's surface off the coast of Miami.

The specific cause of death was deter- -

mined by an autopsy, to be asphyxia-
‘tion. ¢ :

+ Last year, an “underworld colleague
‘ef Rosselli, Sam (Momo) Giancana,
who also had been recruited. by the

-CIA in-the effort to kill Castro, was ..

-found shot to death in his Chicago
home-in what police described as a
highly professional job by assailants!
:who penetrated the ‘mobster's per-
‘sonal security screen. Giancana was
due to testify before the Senate Intel-
iligence Committee shortly after his.
idemise.

Neither murder has been solved.
+ The possibility that Rosselli’s mur-
der might have been related to his
Senate testimony on the CIA schenies
to kill Castro has brought the FBI
‘into the investigation at the request
_of Attorney General Edward H. Levi.

The involvement of Rosselli, Gian-
cana and other underworld figures—
principally Santos
Tampa, Fla, whose one-time Havana
gambling enterprises fell hostage in
1959 to the Cuban revolution—in plots

against Castro had been a elosely held |

secret within the top echelons of the
CIA and FBI until recently.

The tangled chronology of suppres-
sion and eventual disclosure, although |
detailed in the June report, has re-
ceived little public attention. Rossel-
li's murder adds significance to those
events.

Here is the sequence, pieced to-
gether from the testimony given to
Senate intelligence investigators:

Columnist Drew Pearson went to

“the late Chief Justice of ‘the United”

States Earl Warren late in.: January,

1967, and told him that a Washington.
lawyer had confided to him that one~

of his clients said the United States
“had attempted to assassinate Fidel
Castro in the early 1960s and Castro.
had decided to retaliate.”

Warren declined Pearson’s sugges: -

tion that he see the lawyer, who was
Edward Morgan. Warren referred the
matter to then Secret Service Direc-

tor James J. Rowley, who on Feb. 13,-

1967, wrote.FBI Director J. Edgar Ho-
over, informing him of the allegations.

Trafficante of -

' fs Hoover sent the Rowley letter to six
senior bureau officials on an “eyes-
,onty” basis. There is no record of FBI

gations. At that point the sensitive Jet-
tH ter bounced back and forth’in the
higher reaches of the FBI bureauc-
, yraey.

; The job of responding, to Rowley’s
letter was assigned to the supervisor
‘of the FBI’s General Investigative Di-

; Incetings or discussions of those alle- -

the overall assassination investigation
“in March 1964.

. This official’s job was complicated
‘;. by the fact that he had never been in-
formed of what Hoover and his closest
circle of confidants in the FBI learned

». nent American underworld figures, in-

sination of President Kennedy. This
‘bureau is not conducting,;any investi-

-. Drew Pearson went ahead and pub-
lished acolumn on March 7, 1967, ref-
erring to reports that CIA schemes
against Castro’s life in 1963 “may

* have resulted in a counterplot by Cas-
tro to assassinate President Kenne-
dy.”

Ten days later, Marvin Watson, one
of Lyndon Johnson's chief deputies,
. called FBI. assistant director Cartha
DeLoach with the message that “the

-’ President had instructed that the FBI’

interview (Morgan) concerning any
knowledge he might have’ regarding.
the assassination “of President Ken;
nedy.”

peared Morgan “did not want to be in-
“terviewed, and even if he was inter-
‘viewed he would probably not divulge
the identity of his sourcés . . .” . Wate
son persisted, however.
. “Under the circumstances.” De.
*. Loach concluded in. a memo for the.
. files. “it appears that we have no al-
ternative but to interview (Morgan)

-4 So on Feb, 15, 1967, the FBI official,
“ prepared a draft reply to the Rowley~
letter for his superiors saying “our in-°

DeLoach told Watson, that ‘it ap:

and then furnish the results to Wat. :

son in blind memorandum form.”

The interview was assigned to two
agents from the FBI’s General Investi-
gative Division, which the Senate

=

_ committee concluded was “puzzling”

because it was the Domestic Intelli-
gence Division which had heen as-
signed responsibility for investigating
possible foréign involvement in the
assassination.

Neither agent was privy to the
knowledge, confined to Hoover and
his top aides, of the CIA's assassina-
tion plots against,Castro. Both agents
testified eight years later that they
were “surprised” when Morgan al-
luded during the interview ‘to U.S. at-
tempts to assassinate Castro.

“These agents stated that they

could not evaluate the lawyer's
“(Morgan’s) allegations or question him
in detail on them, since they, had not
been briefed-on the CIA assassination
efforts,” the Senate committee ob-
served.
+ On March 21, 1967, the FBI's Wash-
ington Field Office sent headquarters
ten copies of a blind memorandum
summarizing the interview with Mor-
gan... °

Ina Senate Intelligence Committee
summary of the FBI interview, Mor-

* gan was reported to“have acknowi- .

edged that his clients' were “on the
fringe of the underworld” and that
they faced “possible prosecution in a‘

crime not related to the assassination

Morgan said: his clients “were ealled
upon by a governmental agency to as-
sist in a project which was said to .
have the highest governmental ap-
proval. The project had .as its purpose
the assassination of Fidel Castro.
Elaborate plans were made. includjng

. the infiltration of the: Cuban Govern: -

ment and the placing of-informants
within key posts in Cuba.”

Morgan also told the FBI, according
to the summary, that Castro had em-
ployed “teams ‘of individuals who
were dispatched to the United States.,
for the purpose of assassinating Presi-

‘dent Kennedy.”

It was not“clear then—nor is it to”
day—why Morgan: came forward at °
that time to bring’ Rosselli’s story to
the ears of the nation’s highest law.
enforcement authorities. :

it may be relevant that Rosselli had’
‘serious legal problems at the time.

In May, 1966, the FBI. threatened to
deport. him for ‘living in the United
States under an assumed name unless
he cooperated in an investigation of
the Mafia (his true name was Filippo
Saco). At the time, he reached’ a CIA
contact from the anti-Castdo conspir-
acy days, CIA security director Col.

__ Sheffield Edwards, who informed the
FBI that Rosselli wanted’ to “keep -

square with the bureay” but was

afraid that the mob might kill: him for’ :
talking. f°

In 1967, after he was: arrested * Hor
gambling fraud at the Friars .Club!in
Beverly Hills, Rosselli approached his
former CIA case- officer, William Har-

vey, who sought unsuccessfully oO" ‘int

tercede in the prosecution.

It was against this background that -,
Morgan went, first. to. Drew Pearson, ‘3

and then the "FBI, with Rossélli’s Sen- .
sational allegations of CIA plotting

against Castro and the Cuban counter- ‘
_ espionage directed against President :

_ Kennedy.
Last April. Rosselli told the Senate

Intelligence Committee te had no ‘ree. =:

ollection. of either recelving informa-
tion that Castro retaliated against -

President Kennedy or of. having “dis- .
cussed it with Morgan. This meant ei- -:

ther that Rosselli suffered a dramatic -

memory loss or that Morgan’s state-
ment to FBI agents nine years earlier
was a pure invention, 4. Serious risk
for an established Washington lawyer.

No committee source. could explain
the discrepancy, and Morgan declined
to confirm that Rosselli was the client
in question or to discuss either his
allegations against the Cuban govern-
ment or his recent testimony.

The internal FBI memo on the 1967
interview with :Morgan was sent, to
headquarters with a transmittal slip
saying: “No further ‘investigation is
being conducted by the Washington
field office unless it is advised to the
contrary by the Bureau.” ° : *

The Senate intelligence committee,
in commenting on this position, said
that “had the interviewing agents .
known of the CIA-underworld plots -
against Castro, they wouid have been.
aware that the lawyer had clients who-

; had been active in the assassination
plots.” '

On March 21, \FBI headquarters for-
warded the Washington field office
memo to the White House the attor-
ney general and.the Secret Service. Jt
did not recommend any further in-
vestigation of Morgan’s allegations.

On the evening of the following.
day, President Johnson called CIA Di-
rector Richard M. Helms to‘the White
House. The next morning; March 23,
Helms ordered the CIA inspector gen-
eral to prepare a report on the CIA
involvement in the assassination plots +
Operation ° Mongoose—of which : fy

. U.S. leaders aiding terrorist plans to
eliminate Cuban leaders would them-
: selves not be safe.

A U.S. government committee coor-

dinating policy toward Cuba at the

~, time agreed there is a strong liklihood
that Castro would retaliate in some
fashion. Howeved, it concluded Castro
would not risk a major confrontation
with the US. by attacking U.S. lead-
ers.

On the same day Kennedy was as-
sassinated, a CIA officer met with a
high-ranking Cuban official, who had-
said he would kill Castro, to tell him.
the U.S. would provide him with ex. :

- plosives and a poison pen device.

While the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee said it found no evidence suffi-
cient to justify a conclusion that the
Kennedy assassination was part of a
conspiracy, it also said U.S. ‘agencies
did not properly investigate the assas- -
sination,or tell the Warren Commis-

: sion about the CIA plots on Castro’s
ife.

“There is No indication that the FBI :
or the CIA directed the interviewing
of Cuban sources or sources within
the Cuban exile community,” the Sen-
ate committee said.

According to a former FBI official
in charge of key aspects of the FBI's
probe of the Kennedy murder,. the
FBI, never satisfactorily determined
what Oswald planned to do in Cuba or
what he had done in Russia. .

MEMORANDUM

TO: FRITZ AND BILL

FROM: MIKE EPSTEIN
DATE: JUNE 20, 1975

SUBJECT: GITANCANA

I expect that no one will write off the alleged Giancana murder as a

i
i
i
|
t
t
'

"third-rate homicide," and that.it will grow and grow and grow.. It is clearly
the most volatile media isehe of the season.
Given the parest outlines of what allegedly happened, and taking them

en

at face value, we have a responesbility to take action under 18 U.S. Code,

Section 1505:

Whoever ... by ... force ... endeavors to ... impede any
witness ... in connection with any inquiry or investigation
being had by ... any committee of either House ... or
Whoever ee. by ... force ... obstructs, or impedes or
endeavors TO wee obstruct, or impede ... the due and proper
: exercise of the power of inquiry under which such inquiry
or investigation is being had by ... any committee of
either. House ...

Shai1 be fined not: more than $5, 000 or imprisoned not more
than five years, or both.

“In short, if Giancana Was a "witness" (which status he might have
achieved by mere location contacts made by staff) and he was killed to
prevent his éppearance; or “indeed even if he wasn't yet a "witness" but
this was a "message" to all, witnesses to keep quiet (e.g. Roselli and Maheu),
there is a violation of law'which we might have the responsibility to investigate.

Beyond what our responsibility is, it seems clear to me that most extreme

possibilities of what might actually have happened dictate that we come up

with a well- reasoned position and : plan -~ after careful, deliberate, intensive

HW 50955 Bocld:32423630 Page 643
1 ‘-2-
consideration of all avenues/of approach, pitfalls, suspected motives, etc.

Most important of all, it deths to me, is our acceptance of the fact that.
maybe we don't even have anyone on our staff with sufficient experience,
sophistication, background,- and investigative maturity to deal with this
situation. .

As a first step, I urgeiyour decision to convene a planning session to
decide what the second step will be.

I can't emphasize enough the need for well-thought-out planning here.
Who knows where this will lead? And at a minimum, some months from now,
Senator Church may be asked, “at did you do the day after you learned
that’ Giancena hed been Killed?" °

My stream of consciousness on kinds of things to consider would
include: - What our public etotenent on this should or should not be,
security for other witnesses) imnediate contact with other key witnesses
(to reassure them), secrecy of witness lists and immunity applications,
secrecy of place, time and even fact of interview, meetings with Justice
organized crime section, Chicago strike force, local law enforcement people
in Oak Park. and Tlinois, obtaining all FBI investigative reports (they're
in it per tonight's-Star) , getting background on all law enforcement officials
in Illinois who will be involved. (whom do you trust?), is this a diversion
which we're being sucked into, how do we avoid that (hire someone just for

this), how do we show we care so other witnesses (known or unknown) won't

dry up, etc. etc. etc.

NOTE: Mike can be reached efter 6:45 tonight at (802) 863-2652.

FROM: Ed Greissing
DATE: August 13, 1976 ;
SUBJECT: Mention of Carlos Mar
John Rosselli. :

Lie in the 4/23/76 transcript of

On April 23, 1976 during Mr. Rosselli's appearance before the
-Schweiker-Hart Subcommittee, we}took the opportunity to question
him about any information he might possess regarding the New Orleans
Mafia Chieftan, Carlos Marcello.. \

Our interest in Marcello developed from 1).:the allegation that
Marcello was tangentially involved with both Clay Shaw and David
Ferrie; the fact that Marcello was deported by Attorney General Robert
Kennedy and that the assassination of President Kennedy was a possible
retaliation, ward .

In my telephone conversation with Jim Jotinston, 8/13/76, he could
think of no other reasons why we questioned Rosselli about Marcello.

If you would like to talk to Jim about this matter, his telephone
number is 780-6203. oe ,

from Roselli and Maheu indicating the use of a chef. The pills

were sent down and again returned when this plot failed.

place before the Bay of Pigs. He indicates ,. however, the use of

Varona to be after the Bay of Pigs.

being in the Miami airport.

Dan Rowan. Maheu said t et he had been. requested to place a tap
for Giancana and that Giancana might "stop helping” on the assassina-
tion plot if this tap was not placed. O'Connell checked with
Edwards and received the go-ahead. O'Connell indicates that
Maheu was authorized to pay for DuBois out of the month given him

on the assassination plan.

O'Connell states that! he recalls November 1960 as the time

period of the delivery of the pills for Roselli through Trafficante?
O'Connell recollection that "chef" incident after Bay of Pigs.

O'Connell states that Varona's price was $50,000 -- $10,000

worth of communications equipment in addition.

O'Connell introduced by Roselli to Varona as "Mr. Olds."

Harvey Testimony

Harvey places the fall of 1961 as the time period in which
ZRRIFLE was to be applied to Cuba.

Harvey reference to pressure from the Kennedys to topple the
Castro regime clandestinely and not by means of any attack.

Roselli's hearsay knowledge of this?

Harvey states that he recalls firearms in the truck, possibly

“sniper-scope rifles."

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

“I am west ing you today on behalf of. the Select

Committee about the recent death of Samuel Giancana. As
you are no doubt aware, his name “has been raised in the
context of allegations concerning the Central Intelligence
Agency's possible involvement in so-called political
assassinations.

Based on information available to the Committee,
it was obvious that: ‘he might be knowledgeable about the
political assassination matter. Although Mr. Giancana

had not actually been subpoenaed to testify by this Com-

“?mittee, he had been approached by members of the staff

for a possible interview. Since this might involve viola-
tion of federal statutes pertaining to obstruction of a
Congressional Committee investigation, the Select Committee
is requesting that you instruct the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to keep it fully informed of all information
“coming to the Bureau's attention pertaining to Mr. Giancana's
_ death. In making this request, the Committee is not soneed~
9 Ang its right to conduct its own investigation of this
matter However, it is acting in the spirit of cooperation

on a question of mutual concern to the Executive and Legis-

lative Branches of government.

HW 50955 Doela32423630, Page 654
\,

yt

The Committee is also concerned about the
safety of several other possible witnesses. Therefore,
we request 24-hour-a-day protection by the United States.
Marshall Service for the following witnesses which the

Committee has subpoenaed, intends to subpoena, has inter-

viewed, or intends to interview:

(Alternative paragraph:

) The Committee is also concerned about the
safety of several other possible witnesses. We would
like to discuss with members of your staff the necessity
for special arrangements by the United States Marshall
Service to ensure the safety of witnesses who have. or
might have to contact with the Committee pertaining to

these matters.)

520) ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir. ;

The Cirarraan, Very well. And then Sergeant de la Liana, will
you identify yourself, please, sir?

Mr. ve ua Liana. Jack de la Liana, Tampa Police Department. I
have been with the police department for 9 years, and attached to the

homicide division for 4 years before starting the criminal intelligence ©

‘unit of the Tampa Police Department.
The Crrairman. Have you had previous police service?

Mr. pe ra Liana. My first experience was 9 years ago, when I -

started first with the force,

The Cuarraan. Chief Brown, do you havea statement, a prepared
statement?

Mr. Brown. Yes, I do, Senator.

The Cuamsran, Ihave a copy of it before me, and I see it has several

pages. Do you wish to read all of it?

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir; I would like to read it to the committee.

The Cuaman, Very well, then, you may proceed.

Mr. Brown. Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, I am
‘Neil G. Brown, chief of the Police Department of the city of Tampa,
Fila.

T have been a member of the Tampa Police Department for the past
16 years, and I have been chief of the department for the past 4 years.
Prior to my appointment as chief, I served as inspector of detectives.
I am a graduate of the National Police Academy of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and a member of the Tampa Bay Area Chiefs
of Police Association and of the International Association of Chiefs
of Police.

With me here today is Sgt. Jack de la Llana who, at my direction,
formed our department’s first criminal intelligence unit in February
‘of 1962, and has been its director since that time. Sergeant de la
Liana also holds the important post of chairman of the Florida In-°
telligence Unit, a statewide agency which coordinates information —
amongst intelligence units in cities throughout the State of Florida, .

In addition to Sergeant de la Llana, whose diligent work and knowl.’
edge of criminal operations has provided much of the foundation for
my statement to you, I feel fortunate in being accompanied also by .
Sgt. William Branch of the intelligence division of the Orlando Police -
Department. Sergeant Branch is presently attending the National
Academy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Tle has been s :
member of the Orlando Police Department since 1951, and a detective
sergeant since 1956. He is particularly familiar with organized gam.
bling operations in the central Florida area, and I believe his presenta
tion of that situation will be of material value to this inquiry. <

I feel privileged to be able to testify before you today. TI believe
that the facts I can present here about organized crime operations in
Tampa will help you and the American public realize the seriousness. :
of this problem, and our Nation’s emergent need for further Federal
legislation to combat an evil that has clearly expanded beyond the.

powers of municipal law enforcement to contain, suppress and elimi.
nate it.

a notoriety greatly disproportionate to their numbers, because of their
continuous activity in criminal and racketeering enterprises. The
people of our city refer to this group as “the Sicilian underworld” or
‘the Mafia.”

Our growing concern with this criminal group was crystallized in
1956 when a Hillsborough County grand jury was empaneled in
Tampa to investigate and determine the truth of allegations that
the Mafin was then operating in Tampa. The pertinent part of that
grand jury’s report stated: 7

* * * there are séme individuals who believe that a Mafia or Black Hand
exists and operates in this community, but they are in the minority. * * *
The evidence presented, the volume of written material examined, and wit-
nesses interviews point to the existence in this community of an organized crime
clement whose methods of operation are similar to the pattern of the Sicilian
Mafia as we understand it. * * *

The Cirammayn. Chief, let me ask you, prior to this development.
before the grand jury, before the grand jury made this finding, were
you the law enforcement officials or in the police department?

Mr. Brown. No, sir. .

The Cuamrman. Were you suspicious that such an organization
existed in your city ? :

Mr. Brown. Oh, yes; law enforcement has been aware that this has
been there.

The Crrairsan. There was something, you felt confident, but you
were unable to bring it out in concrete proof; is that correct?

Mr. Brown. That is correct. :

The Citarraan. So you had been trying to combat it without being
able to get it out in the open? :

Mr. Brown. That is exactly right.

The Cuarrman, Allright. Proceed.

Mr. Brown (reading) : ,

* * * our records indicate that the vast majority of our unsolved crimes stem
from underworld activity involving persons of Sicilian or Italian ancestry * * *

The Cuatrman. We had some startling information here the other
day from the Chicago chief of police with respect to some 976
murders, gangland style, that had been committed over a period of

years, and only 2 of them had been solved. ‘That is, officially solved by
court determination or court action.

Mr. Brown. That is typical.

The Cnamman. What is the ratio in your community, if you can
give us some idea about it?

Mr. Brown. I will bring that out in my statement, but it is just
like Chicago.

. The Ciaran. Something along that line?

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.

The Crrairwan. That. struck me as one of the most frightening
developments of information that I have heard regarding crime. I
just. couldn’t believe that 976 murders, and apparently just murder
in the first-degree fashion, could be committed in an area like Met-
ropolitan Chicago over a period of years, and only 2 of them could
be solved. It thoroughly demonstrates to me the great menace and
the danger of organized mobs committing crime.

You say: “Well, they probably killed each other pretty much.”
That may be true, but they kill each other because of the extortionate

? 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 661

operations that they are engaged in, to the detriment of the public
at large, and to the detriment of innocent people who can’t help
themselves. It focuses and emphasizes how serious this menace is,

Very well, you may proceed.

Mr. Brown. Notwithstanding these findings, the grand jury con-
cluded that there was no national or local Mafia in Tampa. I would
Tike to submit ag exhibit 1a certified copy of the report of the grand
jury dated March 80, 1956.

The Crrainatan. Very well, this report of the grand jury will be
received and it may be made exhibit No. 44, and exhibit 1 to this
witness’ testimony.

I may later direct it be printed, but as of now we will just let it be
filed as an exhibit for reference.

(The document referred to was marked “Exhibit No. 44” for refer-
ence, and may be found in the files of the subcommittee.)

Mr. Brown. It seems likely to me that the grand jury failed to
acknowledge without qualification the presence of the Mafia in Tampa
because it sought a pattern of Mafia operations similar to the historical
Sicilian tradition of primitive and direct extortion, rather than the
sophisticated and polished control of rackets that now characterize
that organization. .

The CuatRMAN. I take it from that last statement that you feel
that they have considerably improved their technique.

Mr. Brown. Very much so.

The Crrarraan. Of crime operations.

Mr. Buown., Very much, .

Senator Musxir. May I ask a question, Chief, there?

‘As T understand what you have just testified relative to the grand
jury’s report, they acknowledged that there was some evidence of the
existence of Sicilian Mafia in the community, but apparently felt
that evidence was not conclusive; is that a correct summary ?

Mr. Brown. That is correct; yes, Senator, The Tampa Police De-
partment, however, has long been aware that many criminals in our
area have local reputations as Mafiosi. My staff and I have made a
careful evaluation of those reputations, based upon personal knowl-
edge, criminal records, surveillance reports, personal histories, familial
relationships, statistical analyses, reports from confidential inform-
ants, information from Federal and local law-enforcement agencies,
and other éustomary police intelligence sources.

It is our considered conclusion that the Mafia exists in Tampa, that
it controls most illegal gambling in Tampa and central Florida, and
that its members have interstate and international ties to other Mafia
groups,

° Tie organization of the Mafia in the Tampa area is best understood
from a chart we have formulated which I submit to this subcommittee”
asourexhibit No.2. ~ .

Senator Musxin. Before we get to that, Chief, may I ask another
question? The grand jury to which you referred sat in 1956, am I
correct ? ; .

Mr. Brown. That is correct, sir.

Senator Musxrr. That is 7 years ago. Do you think you have
accumulated additional evidence as to the existence of the Mafia in
Tampa which would justify a new reference to the grand jury?) ~~

Mr. Brown. Yes; I believe so. :

Senator Muskin. Are you planning that?

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.

The Curaimaan. Very well. This chart may be received as exhibit

far as it can be. ‘Lhe title of it is “The Mafia Organization in the 7

Mr. Brown, By all means; the entirearea.

The Cusirman. All right. This chart is now a part of the record :
and, if you wish to comment about it, we will proceed with your state-
ment.

Mr. Brown. The chart is keyed to show only the criminal, business,
and familial interrelationships and activities of the persons named,
although other criteria figured in our categorization of these persons,
OF course, this chart cannot be considered as a definitive “table of
organization” of the Tampa Mafia, because it is but a simplified repre-
sentation of an organization that is ina constant state of flux, and about
which we know we still have many things to learn.

JIowever, I believe it is completely accurate in showing that Santo
Traflicante is the boss of this criminal group. Indeed, it is to Santo
Traficante that Tampa owes the dubious distinction of having been
represented at the notorious crime convention at Apalachin, N.Y.,

Senator Musxtz. What do they need to do to become members in
the Tampa area?

Mr. Brown. Well, | think T can clarify that later on in the state-
ment, Senator.

The Cuatrman. Allright; you may proceed.

Mr. Brown. Santo Trafticante, Jr., was born in Tampa on November
14,19 He was one of five brothers. He maintains residence today
moi rie and in Miami. Tle previously lived in Havana, Cuba,

where he owned and operated gambling er the Batti
ing opera-

regime. When Fidel Cast?6 Tool: over, ‘Trallicante’s gam
“MME Tre stopped. Ile was expelled from Cuba andy

the United States. He inherited the control of the @fumbers TICs
in central Florida which his father, Santo Traflicant@*Srysehe-dret
in 1954, and he continues to head this operation.

Testimony in the | ia of the Senate Select Committee
on Improper Activities in fhe Labor or Management Field identified
Santo Trafficante, Jr., in ati j j
caging. in Havang. That testimony stated that Traflicante took over
the sane Sone: fron: the Mannarino brothers in Pittsburgh, Pa.
Gabriel Mannarino was a fellow delegate with Santo Trafficante, Jr.,
to the Apalachin crime convention in 1957.

Additional testimony named Trafficante, Jr., as the key figure in
the Mafia in Tampa, stating, as the Tampa police had long known,
that he succeeded his father as the major racketeer in the city.

Other information substantiated by our files reveals that Trafficante
is an associate of such notorious criminals as Meygr Lansky, Joseph
Bonanno, Sagan, Aniello Dellacroce, Jose ET Sam Man-
narino, Joseph Arcuri, and of Joseph Riccobono, also known as Staten
Island Joe, who had been closely allied with the elder Trafficante,
and was also discovered at the Apalachin meeting.

When Joseph Profaci’s daughter Carmella married Anthony Tocco,
con of Detroit mobster William “Black Bill” Tocco, in Brooklyn on
June 4, 1955, one of the guests at the reception in the Ifotel Com-
inodore in New York was Santo Trailicante, Jr. Among those who
also attended were 13 other persons who later attended the Apalachin
conference, as well as other notorious Mafia figures, such as Frank
ALivorsi, Thomas and John Dioguardi, Tony and Albert ‘Anastasia,
and Thomas “Three Finger Brown” Lucchese.

There have been at least two known attempts on the life of Santo
Traflicante: On January 2, 1953, he was shotgunned in a ‘car on the
streets of Tampa, receiving wounds in the arm. Later, in Cuba, four
American mobsters who intended to kill Traflicante were told by
Cuban police that they would have to do it on American soil.

Trafficante has been arrested in ‘Tampa several times for investiga-
tion, because of our knowledge that he was deeply involved in gam-
bling, even though we liave not yet been able to obtain the quantum of
proof necessary to a successful prosecution, He has also been picked
up by the police for questioning about the gangland slayings of Rene
Nunez, Angelo Giglio, and Joe Antinori. : :

Traflicante was a suspect In the Albert Anastasia murder on Oc-
toher 25, 195%, in New York because he had appeared in New York
just before the murder. He was considered a likely suspect because
there had been reports that Anastasia was then attempting to move

in on Traflicante’s gambling operations in Cuba. Traflicante, using
the alias “B. ITIU,” stayed with Anastasia in the latter’s hotel suite,
on the night of October 24, 1957, and moved out approximately 1 hour
after Anastasia’s murder ina nearby barber shop.

The Department’s evaluation of Traflicante as the hoss of the Mafia
organization in Tampa was confirmed, of course, by the positive identi-
fication of the “Louis Santos of Havana, Cuba,” apprehended at the
Apalachin conference in November of 1957, as Santo Traflicante, Jr.,
of Timpa, Fla.

Furthermore, we have witnessed and documented many visits of
out-of-town racketeers with Santo Trafficante and his fellow hoodlums
of the Tampa area. These visitors give further indications that Traf-
ficante is associated with Mafia members in other cities. For example,
Louis Coticchia of Chicago, also known as Lou Brady, has been fre-
quently seen visiting Traflicante and on one occasion they were seen
boarding.a plane together, heading for Miami.

Other known outside racketeers who have visited in Tampa with
Traflicante gang members are John Joseph Vitale, Salvatore Lopic-
colo, and Anthony Giardano, all known racketeers from St. Louis, Mo.

Mr. O’Donnety. I think at the present time, in interest of conti-
nuity, so that the record will read properly, Sergeant de la Llana bas
a statement with regard to a courier operation within the Mafia. In
the interest of time, I am not going to ask him to read it, but I would
like to have it introduced in the record.

Do yowhave that? :

Mr. peta Liana. Yes, I do.

Mr. O’Donnett. How many pages does it consist of ?

Mr. pena Liana. Itis five pages. .

The Cnamman. Give a better description of it and tell us what. it is.

Mr. pe va Luana. It is with reference to Louis Coticchia, alias Lou
Brady, and his visits to Tampa on various occasions, which first came
to our attention on April 13, 1962. This subject. has a long criminal
record. I have an FBI record which I will also submit. into evidence.

The Cuamaran. Let the FBI record be received and made exhibit
No, 46 for reference.

(Document. referred to marked “Exhibit No. 46” for reference and
may be found in the files of the subcommittee.)

The Crainman. Now, your statement, is that. a summary statement
that you have made and prepared for the record?

Mr, pena Luana. Yes, sir.

The Cuamman. Very well, it may be received and printed in the
record, cither at this point or immediately following the prepared
statement of the witness now testifying. :

(The statement referred to follows:)

SraTeMeNt or Sot. JACK pE LA LLANA

One of the clear ties of the Trafficante organization with other criminal groups
is reflected by the contacts with Trafficante made by a nan who appears to act
as a courier for the Mafia. Louis Coticchia, alias Lou Brady, FBI Ne, 1427493,
first came to the attention of our Department on April 13, 1962, when we ob-
served him, in Tampa, in the company of Augustine I'rimo Lazzara and Frank
Diecidue, two of the men on our Mafia chart. Because of this and other con-
tacts made by Coticchia, our intelligent unit developed the following informa-
tion about him which I think is of interest to this committee in giving a profile

HWY 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 665

526 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS.

of a hoodlum who ts entrusted by the Mafia to act as a courier for them between
the various groups.

Coticchia was born on February 25, 1920, in Cincinnati, Ohio, When he was
arrested a couple of years ago, he gave as his vecupation “industrial tinancier.”
He is presently reported to be interested in the operation of a company offering
wired music in the Chicago area known as Symphonalre Svund Systems, Ine.

jlis criminal record shows that he was first arrested in 1936 in Ohio for
robbery. In 1937 he was arrested in Miami, Fla. for investigation of a “shake-
down.” He was held for 4 days and released without charges. He was arrested
again in Hot Springs, Ark., in 4938 for iuvestigation aud released with the under-
standing that he would leave the city. : ;

In 1938, in Cleveland, Coticchia was arrested and charged with assault with
intent to commit rape. He was convicted and received 1 to 15 years, of which
he served 4 years, being released in 1941. Ile was arrested in 1942 in Los Angeles,
Calif., on a warrant issued in Baltimore for grand theft. He was tried in Baiti-

-more for receiving stolen goods and received 5 years in prison.

Coticchia was again arrested in Dallas, Tex., in 1961, by the U.S. marshals
for violation of and for conspiring to violate the. Federal Sec rities and Exchange
Act of 1983, which case is still pending in the Southern District Court of New
York. His last arrest known to us was on January 4, 1963, when he was ar-
rested in Tampa for investigation of grand larceny. He was released due to
insufficient evidence.

Cotiechia worked as a “pit boss” in gambling casinos in Las Vegans, Nev., and
Yiavana, Cuba. He was involved in a scandal’in 1960 in which mobsters at-
tempted to take over a nationwide bail bond business,

Coticchia has been in and out of Tampa since our first observation of him and
on every occasion he is in direct contact with Trafficante and Diecidue. On
December 31, 1962, he purchased a new automobile in Tampa, paying the dealer
$3,625.95 in cash. He then istered the car under the name of Jane Campbell.
He remained in Tampa several days and was in coustant contact with Trafficante
and Diecidue.

On January 4, 1963. Cotiechia was arrested in Tampa on suspicion of grand
larceny and at the time of his arrest he hud $1,775 in cash on his person, He
had papers on him that showed he had resided previously at the Aloha Motel in
Miami under the name Luiz Paulino Bailey from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He
also had a paper with a list of gambling equipment and the name “Empress
Lines, Ltd., Nassau—via Wappen Vor Hamburg—German boat loading pier
No. 3."

‘An investigation revealed this equipment had been shipped airfreight from
Las Vegas to Nassan and placed in a German vessel, the Wappen Von Hamburg,
which sails between Nassau and Miami. This equipment included 50 one-arm
bandits, or slot machines, and was valued in excess of $65,000, ‘The information
received was that this vessel was to travel between Miami and Nassau as a
floating gambling casino,

After Cotiechia’s arrest in Tampa, the telephone calls were checked at the
motel. It showed that he had made several calls to Trafficante, Diecidue, and
other associates of Trafficante. He had also made a long-distance call to Sonny’s
Restaurant in Miami Beach, which is owned by Thomas Altamura, FBI No.
511563, a Mafia member and another associate of Santo Trafficante, Jr.

L would like to submit for the record Coticchia’s FBI record, and a photograph
of him taken by my department when he was arrested in Tampa on January
4, 1963.

Another example of the Trafficante group's connections with Mafia figures in
other parts of the Nation is: John Joseph Vitale, FBI No. 793259, of St. Lonis,
Mo. Vitale is well known to the St. Louis Metropolitan Votice Department, and
is reputed to be the Matia leader in that area. Ue has a reeord of 13 arrests
and a conviction for violating the Harrison Narcotics Act for which he received
a sentence of 7 years’ fmprisonment. He has been arrested as a fence and is
believed to deal in anything in which there is a large percentage of profit.

Police authorities consider him among the most dangerous of Mafia principals
in the St, Louis area, and he is known to have underworld counections through-
out the country. He appeared twice before the Senate Rackets Committee
(August 19, 1958, and February 11, 1959) and each time refused to answer any
questions, invoking the fifth ninendment.

On April 17, 1963, Vitale few from St. Louls to Tampa, using the name “Jack
Howard.” Le visited the Diecidues for 4 hours and then flew back to St, Louls

using the same alias. We alerted the St. Louis police and upon Vitale’s arrival
there, he was interviewed by detectives of that city. Ile declared that he had

traveled to Tampa to settle a debt of the Lombardo Produce Co., of St. Louis,
Mo. to the Diecidue Bros. of Tampa.

To me it does not seem probable that Vitale would go to the expense and
trouble of ilying to Tampa and returning the same day in order to settle a debt
between two produce companies with which he has no known connections. More

Significantly, his use of an alias to run this errand, too, points out his own
doubts that he was engaged in a legitimate errand,

Mr. O’Doynece. All right, we will continue.

Mr, Brown. Some of ‘Traflicante’s men shown here on our chart
gave sworn testimony before the Hillsborough County solicitor in

1953 concerning gambling in Tampa. They admitted that they had
long been engaged in iUegal gambling activities. They were forced
to testify or face jail terms for contempt of court, because they had
been granted immunity from prosecution for such crimes. Among
those who testified were Frank Diecidue, Augustine Primo Lazz:
Nick Scaglione, Henry Traflicante, and James ©. Longo.

Mr. O'Donneun. Are any of these individuals on the chart that
you have introduced as exhibit 2?

Mr. Brown. Yes, they are all on the chart.

Mr. O’Donwenn. Thank you.

Mr. Brown. Santo Traflicante has himself been caught up in.a typi-
cal Mafia technique of seeking to preserve and protect-its illegal enter-
prises by the corruption of law enforcement aud other public officials.
This incident substantiated our intelligence that ‘Lratlicante was
deeply involved in gambling operations, and it showed that he had
major interests in gambling outside the city of ‘Tampa.

The case was initiated in 1954 by a veteran St. Petersburg police
officer, Detective Sgt. Harry Dietrich, who lad obtained evidence of i
the operation of the ‘Traflicante bolita ring. Bolita is a numbers us
racket of considerable importance in Florida, involving weekly payoffs ’
based upon information taken from radio reports of the weekly Cuban
lottery. MG

‘An attempt was made to bribe Sergeant Dietrich to ignore the i
operation of the ring. Ife was given a new car, a television set, some
suits of clothing, and cash. Sergeant Dietrich accepted the bribes
with the full knowledge and o s_of his superiors, to whom he
had immediately reported tl y attempt.

1 to 100 and receive a 60-to-1 return if they win. The Cuba winning
number is the last two digits from the Cuban national lottery number
which is five digits and is broadcast over a Havana radio station each
Saturday shortly after 2 p.m.

The public is contacted by “peddlers” or “sellers,” who receive.a com-
mission of 15 percent of their sales. “Pickup” men, who take the bets
“from the sellers to the “checkup houses,” receive 20 percent of what
they collect. Employees such as checkup men, adding machine opera-
tors, and supervisors above this position usually receive salaries for
their duties.

Lottery operations in central Florida prior to 1948 were dominated
first by Charlie Wall of Tampa and then by Sam Warren, an Orlando
native. In that year Harlan Blackburn, FBI No. 1026922, a con-

530 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS

It has also been obvious to us that the Trafficante organization has
controlled the Blackburn operation for at Teast the last 10 years.
From our examination of seized records, and from the fact that in
all raids on the checkup houses we have, arrested persons having
close family ties with the Traflicante organization who were acting
as auditors for his interests. In addition, there has been heavy tele-
phone toll traffic between the "Prafficantes in Tampa and the Blackburn
group in Orlando.

When Blackburn was arrested in 1953, a memorandum was found
containing telephone numbers of Augustine Primo Lazzara, Salva-
tore J. Lorenzo, J. M. Cacciatore—unele of Santo Trafficante, Jr—and
Santo Traflicante, Jr., and of the Nebraska and Flamingo Bars, both
owned by the Trafficante family.

In 1987 a search of a gambling: house in Orange County by a State
officer, with the assistance of the Orlando Police, resulted in the
arrest of several persons. One of these was Lorenzo and another per-
son by the name of Leto, from Tampa. They both gave sworn state-
ments at that time fo the county solicitor that they were working for
Santo Trafficante, Jr.

Yn November 1961, another raid was conducted by agents of the
Internal Revenue Service in conjunction with the Orlando Police
Department on a house in Orange County. There were six persons
arrested, and among those were ‘Armando. Rios and Sam Cacciatore.
These two were cousins of Santo Trafficante, Jr. .

In July 1963, a raid on a gambling house in Sanford, Fla., by the
IRS agents, with the assistance of the Orlando Police Department,
established that it was another operation of Harlan Blackburn’s,
supervised by Clyde Lee. In the records seized there was the phone
number of ‘Traflicante’s cousin, John Favata Cacciatore, and the
phone number of the printing establishment employing Stefano
Scagtione, who is also on the chart.

During the past 12 years that we know of at least three murders
that have been due to lights for control of lottery operations in the
Orlando area.

The fantastic amount of money taken in by these lottery operations
has been repeatedly established by our raids of these gambling houses.
For example, the raid in 1957 in Orange County, where Frank Ferrert
and Sam Lorenzo were arrested, disclosed that the house was doing
a gross business of $100,000 per week.

Genator Musk. What were they paying out?

Mr. Brancir. ‘The profit on this operation runs about 50 percent.

Tho November 1961 raid in Orange County where Armando Ries
and Sam Cacciatore, cousins of Santo Traflicante, were arrested re-
vealed that operation was doing a conservatively estimated gross of
$160,000 per week.

The Ciairman. With the same ratio of half applying there?

Mr. Braxcn. Yes, sir.

Senator Musxis, When you say “net profit,” this means after
deductions of the commission which totaled 35 percent?

Mr. Branci. Yes, sir. :

Senator Musnre. And the prizes.

Mr. Brancit. Yes, sir. :

The commission and also the prizes and what other operating ex
penses they may have such as automobiles, rent, telephone bills.

From those figures.

The Craman. Where was that raid?

Mr. Brancu. That was in Sanford, Fla, just 17 miles north of
Orlands. These figures are established by the Internal Revenue agents
and auditors. :

From these figures, it is easy to see why the Mafia has moved so
heavily into lottery gambling in central Florida and why gambling
revenues are universally acknowledged to be the “lifeblood” of orga-
nized -crime.

Any additional legislation that this subcommittee can promote to
further restrict and inhibit gambling will, in our opinion, be a sub-
stantial blow to organized crime.

Senator Musxts. Did they actually pay off on those lotteries or
was it dishonest in that respect, too? .

Mr. Brancu. Usually they pay off.

They don’t pay off when we pull a raid on them or arrest them.
They stop at that. But they are in operation the next weels.,

The Crarrman, You mean they do not pay off for that day?

Mr. Brancrt. No, sir; they don’t. :

The Cirairman. It is unfortunate for the fellow that won, who
cannot get his winnings.

TESTIMONY OF NEIL G. BROWN—Resumed

Mr. Brown. To understand the crime network Trafficante operates
it is necessary to examine the modern era of crime in Tampa, which
cates from the early 1920's, Its most. violent episodes were between
1937 and 1945, when the Sicilian underworld was attempting to move
inon all illegal gambling in Tampa. ‘This period in the history of our
city was referred to as “the era of blood.”

; Senator Musxu. Who coined that phrase, the gang or the news-
papers?

Mr. Brown. I think it was the newspapers, Senator.

During the 1920's, before the Sicilian underworld moved into the
rackets to any great extent, one of our most notorious residents, Charles
AML Wall, started his rise to become the acknowledged boss of most of
the egal gambling in the Tampa and central area of the State of
Florida. He styled himself “dean of the underworld,” and in 1953 he
admitted toa Hillsborough County solicitor that he had made his liv-
ing from illegal gambling. During 19 5, Wall forfeited his leadership
by entering into a partnership with Santo Traflicante, Sr,

y The elder Trafficante was born in Si ly in 1886. He came to Tampa
1904 and became a naturalized citizen in 1925, In 1950, he was one
ff the missing witnesses in the Kefauver crime hearings held in

Tampa. THe died on August 11, 1954. Police records do not show any
- arrest for Santo Trafficante, Sr. .
In 1952, Wall declared that he was retiring, although he did not

532 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC NARCOTICS

state what he was retiring from. Ti , Wall's body was
found in his home. Ile had been brute erfen and his throat had
been slashed. We have never discovered who the murderers were, nor
have we determined their motive. Perhaps Wall was murdered be-
cause the killers learned he had admitted that he was Trafficante’s
partner in illegal gambling, and that he disclosed confidential facts
about the Mafia. :

Tn 1960, Sergeant de la Llana obtained—from a confidential son
of known reliability—an astounding report about the Mafia and its op-
eration in Tampa. The report had been obtained from Charles Wall
in 1945, approximately 6 months after Trafficante, Senior, had made
himself a partner in Walls’ gambling enterprises. se

Wall declared that from 1920 through 195 he controlled gambling
in Tampa and in the Florida counties of ILillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco,
Hernando, Polk, and Orange. His rival for control of the gambling
rackets was the local Mafia organization, This was headed, he said,
by Santo Trafficante, Sr., the Diecidue brothers, James Lumia, Lgnacio
‘Antinori and Salvatore Italiano, Antinori was murdered on October
92, 1940; Lumia was murdered on June 5, 1950; and Italiano fled to
Mexico in 1951. :

Wall admitted that he had good reasons for going along with Traffi-
cante, Senior, in 1945; previously the Mafia group had made three at-
tempts on his life: the first was in 1937 as Wall was leaving a bank on
the main street in Tampa; the second try occurred as Wali was leaving
the garage behind his house; the third, in 1940, happened a few blocks
from his house. In the third attempt, a truck passed the automobile in
which Wall was riding and then stopped abruptly in front of the car.
James DeSimone and Nicola Impostato, FBI No. 2716692, each armed
with a shotgun, stepped from the truck and fired at Wall and his
chauffeur. [oth escaped with slight injuries. DeSimone and Impo-
stato were known Mafia killers from Kansas City, Mo. They were
staying with the Antinori family at the time.

The Cuaman. Is Wall still living?

Mr: Brown. No, sir; he was killed.

The Cuaimman. Later killed?

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir.

The Ciraman. ‘These three attempts failed but later he was killed?

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir. .

Wall declared that the Mafia tried to make the public believe that
the organization no longer existed in this country and that Mafia mem-
bers pointed to the end of terrorism among Italian groups as evidence

that the Mafia was gone from the underworld sceue. Wall believed,
however, that, the organization had merely changed its type of opera-
tion. Le said that other. racketeers had once used the Mafia to
monopolize rackets in major American cities. They had educated the
Mafia so well in the process that the Sicilians had taken over the rackets
themselves. Wall stated that the Mafia learned to consider extortion
from Italian businessmen a “nickel-and-dime” business. They had
discovered that public oflicials could be corrupted by bribery and that
they could organize to take over the major rackets in the United States.
Wall declared that the Mafia was not dying out, but “was bigger
and better than ever.” Ie said that his partner, the elder Trafficante,
had told him that there were some 10,000 active Mafia members in
the United States. Wall stated that the Mafia leader in Tampa was

a sizable Sicilian population. There was a national board, headed
by Joseph Profaci in New York City, which was composed of the heads
of the major local boards. Traflicante is reported to have said that
Frank Costello, Vincent Mangano, and Joe Massie were influential
members of the national board, and that Frank Nitti and Lucky
Luciano were former members.

According to Wall’s account, the Malia was composed of two dis-
tinct groups, an “inner circle” and an “outer circle.” The general rule
was that only natives of Sicily were admitied to the “mner circle,”
while American-born Italians ‘were recruiled into the “outer circle.”
Wall was told it was possible for a member to be transferred from
“outer” to “inner” status when he performed an act of special merit,
even though he had been born in the United States. ‘The restrictions
were not due to lack of trust. by native Italians toward those of Ameri-
can birth, but because the “inner circle”? usually took the major part

of the proceeds of the Mafia’s legal activities and, therefore, preferred

to keep the membership of the “inner circle” as small as possible.

Senator Muskie, Would you say that this chart represents the
inner circle, Chief?

Mr. Brown, At the very top portion, Senator, would be the inner
circle. :

Below that——

Senator Musxtm. By the “top portion,” do you mean.

Mr. Brown. I would include in that that the three top men would
bein the inner cirele and those below that would be in the outer circle.

The Cuairnman. Those would only be in the inner circle so far as
the Tampa area is concerned ?

Mr. Brown. That is right. -
The Craimwan. Not. in the inner circle overall?
Mr. Brown. No, sir; this is Just in the inner circle in the T:

i ampa area,
The Ciairman. But that gives an indication of how the overall
organization is set up.

Mr. Brown. ‘That is correct.

The Ciramatanw. You may have it in here, but I may have missed
it, but who was Wall talking to when he gave all this information?

Mr. Brown. That was a confidential informant.

The Crairwan, I see. Very well,

Mr. Brown. Wall believed the influential Mafia members in Tampa

ano, James Lumia, and the Diecidue family—Alfonso, Antonio,
Thomas, and Frank. ‘The Diecidues and their in-laws opposed the
leadership of Traflicante in the Tampa organization. ‘Trafficante told
Wall that Vincent: Mangano, of the national board, supported the

Diecidues but that he, Traffieante, was able to stay in power because he
bad Joseph Profaci’s friendship.

ence to a national organization in the Mafia, Was it referred to as
such?

Mr. Brown. This is the information as Wall has reported that it
consisted of a national board. .

‘Senator Musxix. Do you know who he identified as members of the
national board?

Mr. Brown. Well, Joe Profaci and Vincent Mangano were two of
the members of the national board. .

The Cuainman. They are shown to be leaders of families, both of
them.

Senator Musxrr. But those same people are leaders of families in
New York as testified by Valachi.

Mr. Brown. Yes, sir. .

The Cuatraan. So it is your impression that the heads of the New
York families made up a national board that had jurisdiction over
Tampa, among other places? :

Mr. Brown. That is correct; yes, sir.

Wall declared that there were approximately 40 members of the
Mafia living in the Tampa area and he believed that Trafficante’s
share of proceeds of their gambling operation was being divided with
other members of the Mafia.

Information in our files from another confidential source confirms
Wall's statement. In addition it reveals that Antonio Diecidue made
annual trips to Miami for the purpose of renting a house for Vincent
Mangano, who came down from New York every year to spend 2 or 3
months in Miami. This source stated that many important members
of the Mafia visited Mangano in Florida, but that Traflicante never
appeated.

Senator Musxir. May Task another question on the national board?
Was it your impression that the national board members shared in
the proceeds of the criminal activities in Tampa? .

Mr. Brown. Yes,sir; they hada percentage.

Senator Musxrs. Have you any idea what that percentage was?

Mr. Brown, No,sir; Ihave no idea.

The gray shadings on our chart depict the influence of each of
these men. To me, it appears to be no small coincidence that in
Tampa the Diecidue family lost stature from at least the early 1950's
when Vincent Mangano disappeared; nor that Traflicante, Jr., the
Profaci man, avas in the immediate vicinity, when Albert Anastasia
was murdered in 1957. : .

Serecant de la Llana’s intelligence unit has prepared summaries of
the men in Trafficante’s organization, along with a commentary of
relevant facts about each of them. So that our information may be
avatlable not only to the subcommittee, but to all police units to whom
your reports are so valuable, I wish to submit these summaries and

(The document referred to marked “Exhibit No. 49” for reference,
ancl may be found in the files of the subcommittee.)

The Cirarratan. Now the record is straight.

You may proceed.

Mr. Brown. Our department has always found it a most. dificult
task to obtain evidence suilicient for successful prosecution of Malia
menibers, because the witnesses who might offer such evidence have al-
ways been reluctant to do so. The paramount reason, of course, is
their fear of Mafia reprisals, since it is common knowledge in ‘Tampa
that the Mafia does not hesitate to use murder for such reprisals and
the relative infrequency with which such professional murders are i
successfully prosecuted.

We have categorized certain homicides in the Tampa area, from
1928 to the present, as “gangland slayings.” An examination of the
circumstances of some of these murders emphasizes how the Mafia
uses murder to discipline its membership, to revenge itself against vio-
lators of its code and to otherwise eliminate opposition to its criminal
activities and goals. Of the 23 homicides on the list, only 1 has been
solved. A ratio of less than 5 percent of solution—and that par-
ticular murder was cleared up because it apparently resulted from an
argument, although it is possible that the slayer deliberately provoked ;
the argument. It was not, therefore, a typical gangland slaying, al- 7
though the killer and the victim were both underworld figures.

In startling contrast to the number of unsolved gangland slayings,
an examination of all other Tampa homicides from 1958 through
1962 shows that we have had 145 murders and that only 4 are presently
unsolved, a solution ratio of better than 97 percent. From 1960
through 1962, all $3 homicides in our city were solved.

Mr. Brown. I have had these gangland slayings listed, with a few
pertinent comments about each, and submit to the subcommittee this
list as our exhibit 5. . .

The Cramman. It may be received and be made exhibit No. 50.

(The document referred to was marked “Exhibit No. 50” for ref-
erence and may be found in the files of the subcommittee.)

(At this point Senator Javits withdrew from the hearing room.)

The Ciratratan. You may proceed.

Mr. Brown. With few exceptions, those murders well reflect Joseph
Valachi’s testimony that Mafia members do live by violence and die
by violence.

At least two of the unsolved murders on our list-—that of Gus Perez
in 1936 and of Joe “Pelusa” Diaz in 1958—were, in my opinion, di-
rectly attributable to the Mafia’s knowledge or belief that the victims
had given to legal authorities evidence incriminating Mafia members.
A third murder—of Carl Carramusa, in 1945—taking place in Chi-
cago, involved some Tampa Mafiosi, and is of particular interest in
illustrating the Mafia zeal for vengeance against a member who vio-
lates its rules. It is of further significance, too, in demonstrating the
difliculty of protecting witnesses against the Mafia—and is under-
lining Attorney General Kennedy’s request for additional funds for
that purpose, which request I strongly endorse.

The Carramusa case developed in Kansas City, Mo., with certain
aspects related to the Mafia organization in Tampa. The principal
figure in the case was Carl Carramusa, known as a minor member of
the Mafia and a front man for the Mafia’s narcotics traffic operation
in Kansas City.

Carramusa was indicted in 1942 for conspiring to violate the Fed-
eral narcotic laws. Ilis codefendanis were Joseph DeLuca, Nicola
Impastato, Paul Antinori, Joe Antinori, Charles Gerrgimina, Louis
Ventola, Patsy Ventola, Charles Tiabi, Samuel Pernice, and Fellipo
Fernice. Tampa’s Mafia organization was one of the sources of sup-
ply for the Kansas City group, and at that time the narcotics trade
in Tampa was headed by Paul Antinori and Joseph Antinori, who
had inherited the narcotics leadership from their father, Ignazio An-
tinori. The elder Antinori had been murdered a few years before in
anarcotics deal. All of the defendants in the Kansas City case were
prosecuted successfully, primarily because Carramusa violated the
cardinal Mafia code of l’omerta, or silence, testifying openly against
them at their trial. After the trial, Carramusa went into hiding in
Chicago with his wife and family, changing his name and beginning
anew life under new circumstances.

Three years later, in June of 1945, while he was seated in his auto-
mobile, Carramusa’s head was blowa off by a shotgun blast. James
Lumia, an associate of the Antinoris, was a suspect in this killing,
but was himself murdered at Tampa in June of 1950. A prime suspect
was the same Nicola Impastato, who had some years before attempted
to kill Charles Wall. co

In Tampa we have suffered also the frustration I know that many
of my police colleagues in other cities have experienced—the deliberate
recanting at trial of the original statements of complaining or key
witnesses, because of their fear of Mafia reprisal, i clear instance
of this. frustration of law enforcement effort involved three of the

588 ORGANIZED CRIME AND ILLICIT TRAFFIC IN NARCOTICS

One day in 1958, one Joe Castellano went to the Italian Club in
Tampa to play cards with a group of friends. During the course
of the evening, he talked to Salvatore Scaglione privately. Scaglione
asked Castellano if he wanted to make a profit on a “hot load” of
whisky. Castellano said he was interested, and they agreed to meet
later that night.

At the meeting, Scaglione was accompanied by Joe Mistretta and
Angelo LoSealzo. Castellano got into the front seat of a car provided
by the others, and the four men drove to a thickly wooded area outside
of Tampa city limits. Castellano was then attacked with a hammer,
being hit repeatedly on the head. He managed to get out of the car,
although he was badly hurt. He broke loose from his elderly assail-
ants and ran away. ITe stumbled into a nearby house and asked to
be taken to the constuble’s house, where he gave a statement about
the incident, naming the three as his assailants. He swore to the
county solicitor that he had no idea why he was beaten. Scaglione,
Mistretta, and LoScaizo were arrested and charged with assault with
_intent to murder.

Joe Castellano disappeared for a period of time. After he was
found, the case went to trial. Castellano changed his story completely
and testified that he had injured himself while hunting on the night
of theattack. ‘The predictable result, of course, was a verdict for the
defendants of “not guilty.”

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO FIGHT
ORGANIZED CRIME

I believe firmly that it is almost impossible for the Police. Depart-
ment of the City of Tampa, or any other municipality, to cope ef-
fectively with the activities of a national or international crime
syndicate such as these hearings show exists in the United States.

ne of the main problems is that the most dedicated, well-trained,
and well-staffed police force is almost always limited legally and
financially to the territorial boundaries of its municipality. For
example, the Tampa Police’ Department is obviously interested in
and informed about the activities of Santo Trafficante. However, in
the past the department was unable to do anything about Trafficante’s
operations in pre-Castro Cuba; it has no jurisdiction or control of
his illegal affairs in Miami and elsewhere in central Florida. The
department could only record that he attended the Apalachin meeting
in November of 1957, but it could do nothing about this obvious evi-
dence that he was a high-ranking member of a national crime
syndicate.

In the light of our experience with the Mafia in our own city’s
underworld, I submit for this subcommittee’s consideration some sug-
gestions for Federal legislation which I believe would certainly help
local law enforcement agencies to fight organized crime more
effectively. ‘

1. More ample funds must be obtained by local agencies to recruit
high caliber police personnel and to retain superior personnel having
the experience and capabilities to understand, investigate, and prose-
cute organized criminal conspiracies. Because of the demonstrated
interstate nature of organized crime, Federal legislation similar to

Castro Plot to JFK Death? —

By RON LaBRECQUE

Heraid Staff Writer
In 1960, when the CIA was try-

‘ing to-set up a delicate attempt on
the life of Fidel Castro, it turned to

a man once described as ‘‘the big-

“gest flag-waving SOB in the coun-

-try”

West Coast underworld

‘figure Johnny Rosselli.

Rosselli — a seemingly improba-

-ble conspirator in a government
“plot — got the “flag-waving” label
-from Salvatore (Momo) Giancdna,
‘then Chicago's top crime boss and

a man Rosselli brought into that

" ‘same plot..
“. Now both are dead, murdered in

the past year, and investigators are
wondering whether their plotting
led to their deaths and whether the
CIA plots against Castro — only
recently made public and even kept
from the Warren Commission’ —
are vitai clues to the John F. Ken-
nedy assassination. :
The deaths of Giancana, in June’
of 1975, and Rosselli, this summer,
have aroused a renewed concern in
Washington, where on Friday the

House of Representives voted to ree:
open the investigation of the Ken-
nedy murder. .

REP. THOMAS N. Downing (D.,
Va.), who will be chairman of the
panel, said he is “convinced” a con-'
spiracy was involved in Kennedy's’
death. ° :

Now, in the aftermath of the:vi i
olent deaths of Giancana and Ros-'
selli, the question arises ‘of what
role, if any, the Kennedy* White
House played in the early 1960s

® Robert Kennedy’s passionate ef-
forts to disable organized crime are
well documented.

IN 1960 when Robert Kennedy
wrote about what he had learned
of organized crime in America
from his years as chief counsel to
the Senate Rackets Committee, he

-too quoted Giancana to make a

point.

He told about Giancana's inter-
view at his local draft board at the
outbreak of World War II, when
he was asked what he did for a live
ing. :

: oy steal,” Giancana is said -to
hhave replied. ~

+ So Sam Giancana didn’t go to
)war and years later would boast to
-Chicago reporter Sandy Smith that
‘he stayed out of the Army — la-
‘beled unfit — by telling the truth.

i “What’s wrong with the syndi-
‘cate?” Kennedy, quoted Giancana.
‘Two or three of us get together

‘says it’s a bad thing. Businessmen

‘personal view that on balance the
ilikelihood that presidents (the re-
‘port dealt with Dwight Eisenhower
and Kennedy) knew of the (Castro)
assassination plots is greater than
the likelihood that they did not.”

*. dust to trace Rosselii’s history
with the CIA is mind-boggling for
the investightors. Yet, it is just one
‘aspect of the search for his killer.

71 when he died — was not first

‘" When Giancana was murdered in

June of 1975, before he could even
be questioned by the committee
staff, authorities attributed it to an
internal gangland struggle — even
though. the: murderer is still un-
known. :

~The death of Rosselli, who had -
appeared before the committee
_ three times in the past year with-
out immunity, caused greater con:

: cern on Capitol Hill.

THE SAME night Rosselli's body
‘was identified —- the legs hacked
off and stuffed along with the body
“into an oil drum -~ Baker, vice
chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, called for the FBI to
‘get involved in the case. (Several!
days later, Attorney General Ed-
- ward Levi ordered FBI involve-
ment.)

It wasn’t until several weeks
later, however, that what was
known to Baker. became public
. knowledge.

A section of the former commit-
tee’s Apri! report told of a Wash-
ington attorney who in 1967. went.
to Supreme Court Chief. Justice...
Earl Warren (chairman: of the«
then-disbanded Warren: Commis-.
sion) to-say that two‘of his‘ clien'
believed they knew ‘about Cub:
agents in the United States wit

conspired in the assassination. of :~

THE INFORMATION: eventually
'- reached the FBI, but as the Senate,
committee concluded this year, the
. 1967 FBI probe was slipshod andj
incomplete. :

One of the clients referred to in|
“the report” has since been identified’
as Rosselli. And it has since been °
jearned that Rosselli was con-
_-vinced he held a vital clue to the
JFK murder.

“There was never the slightest.
doubt in John’s mind that Castro
was responsible for the assassina--
tion of Kennedy.” said Edward P.
Morgan; the attorney referred to in
the report.

Morgan is an attorney of no

counsel to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and for seven
years was chief inspector of the

the CIA plot in 1967, when the De-

: tain that the People he (Rosselli) .
put around Castro in the CIA plot >
turned right around and killed Ken- .

-1967) did it.”

Rosselli, according to Morgan,
decided to talk about his CIA activ--

IN 1961, through a bungled
¢ Wiretap ” “effort, the FBr~ became:
* aware of Rosselli’s CIA activities. ''
: While “Giancana: and "Rosselli.

were in Florida planning the opera-"
tion, Giancana wanted to return to

Las Vegas to check on- his girl

friend, Phyllis McGuire, whom he

suspected’ of dating comedian Dan.

Rowan. To keep Giancana in Flori- |
da, it was agreed that a bug would '
be placed in her hotel room and her.
conversations monitored.

But the private detective they’.
hired, with CIA money. it has since
been learned, was discovered and

“IT was an admirer of Earl War-.

so gruesome a detail from Rosselli-
that the Chief Justice could put. his
name on a report which didn’t as-
sess the most’ significant. piece of-
evidence bearing on the killing: of.

The information Morgan had
‘was passed to Warren via.colum-

friend. Eventually, it reached the.
FBI, but, remarkably, even after di-'
rect orders from President Lyndon
Johnson in the spring of 1967, in-:

THE SENATE ‘Intelligence Com-.

action with a statement former FBI.

‘director J. Edgar Hoover made to
- the Warren Commission on-May 5,5

1964. Hoover said, “well, I can as--

A Senate Committee staff mem*:

‘really happening is that the investi-

gation which the FBI should, have
done in 1967 — and no one can

‘come close to explaining why it

wasn't — is actually being done

_ how.” *

HART, AS have local investiga-
tors, has established three possible
scenario’s for Rosselli’s death: his
recent organized crime activity, re-
taliation for his Castro assassina-
tion efforts or the information he
held concerning the JFK assassina-
tion.
“Maybe Reosé ‘information
was the vical nerve of the.Kennedy~
assassination,” a Senate soures told
The Herald: - i

High officials in the Cuban gov- |
ernment also reportedly feel there »

' was a’“Cuban factor”sin the JFK !
death, but they see it as a result of-

” exile politics, according to a recent
article by Alton Frye, a senior fel-,
low of the Council Foreign Rela-:
tions in Washington. :

Frye wrote that he visited Ha-

" vana recently and met with Cuban,

. Officials including, Deputy Prime:

Minister Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

they volunteer the suspicion

that the recent murders of Sam Gi-
ancana and Johnny Rosselli -

surely have some connection with

) Cuban exile politics and the ‘Kenne-

dy murder,” Frye wrote. .

THERE HAVE been theories re-
cently propounded to show why
both pro and anti-Castro forces ,

~ could have wanted to get JFK out™
r Of power in 1963.

On the one hand, there is the re-*

" port of French journalist Jean Dan- :
_2 del, who was the bearer to Castro -
* of an offer from.JFK for calmer re-
. lations. Castro was reported’ |

; pareeable. The report stated. that
aniel “later was: lunching’ wit
» Castro when word came that Ken-..
““nedy had been’ shot. Daniel de-"

* scribed the Cuban leader as Benu-

_ inely shocked by the news.

It has since been learned that
probably in the very hour JFK was
shot, a one-time Castro supporter
was receiving a poison pen device
‘from a CIA agent in what was a
long-running anti-Castro ‘effort...
That Cuban agent was code-named:
AM/LASH, and he has since been
identified as Rolando Cuebala, now
imprisoned in Cuba for his assassi~.*
- ation plotting. o.. -

WHETHER JFK had knowledg

of, or perhaps even approved,: an

. of the assassination plots: ill

/ ably never be known: .

His closest advisers,” whio testi:

‘ fied before the Senate Committe:

all said he had no knowledge o

* The same month Rosselli was

ontact at a meeting at. the ‘Fon-

= tainebleau, March of 1961, former

Florida Sen. George Smathers. a

friend of Kennedy, said he and

HW 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 661

Kennedy discussed the ramifica-’

tions of a Castro assassination.

Smathers has since said Kennedy
rejected the idea and that the dis-
cussion was more of a “brain-pick-
ing” session,

AT LEAST one “high: level CIA
official did testify he believed the

White House was being briefed on-

the plots but according to Richard
Bissell, one of the officials who
originally decided to use Rosselli, it
was through the method of “plau-
sible deniability.”

That, according to the recent
Senate report, “can also lead to the
use of euphemism and circumlocu-”
tion, which are designed to allow
the President and other senior offi-
cials to deny knowledge of an op-
eration should it be disclosed.” :

Another alleged link between‘
the White House and the under-

‘world plotters, first made public by

the Senate Committee, has also

been denied by virtually everyone -

involved. Judith: Campbell Exner,
the woman who claims to have

. been friend and lover to both Gian-

cana and JFK, introduced to both

by Frank Sinatra, was not a link in.

A MAN with access to Kenne-

ald recently, ‘'The- Giancana-Ros-

The decline of John Rosselli a

“pears ‘to begin in the late 1960s. In<

; 1967, he was convicted-in. a car

cheating scandal at the posh, celeb-":

rity-filled Friar’s Club in: Los. An- .
geles where: the influence of Sina-
tra had made him a member ace
cording to investigators.

Deportation pressures were also
mounting at this time. Mes

ROSSELLI entered prison on the’

conviction in 1970 where he would;

- serve three years of a five-year,
sentence. ~

In 1971, he was brought td a,
federal grand jury in Los Angeles -
which was probing whether some ;
_indentified Detroit organized crime

‘leaders conspired with the. Emprise: —
Corp. — a giant firm with’ nation~;
wide race track and sporting event?
concessions — to: hide financial in-?
terests in the, Frontier Hote!

Rosselli, too, had, an’ interes in.

: the Frontier, which opened in 1967.

He owned the gift shop concession:

hun along, with a partner naméd Joe.

Breen. How Rosselli obtained the-
concession is unclear, but” Breen

; Said it gave Rosselli an’ income of

about $60,000.

ROSSELLI at one time hdd been:
a major influence in Las Vegas.
Several sources sajd that when: the
owners of the Desert Inn wanted
Howard Hughes to move out of the
penthouse — because his special
needs were ‘costly and putting
some “high rollers” in would be
more profitable -- it was Rosselli
-who patched things up. -
Hughes eventually bought the
” Desert Inn, as well as the Frontier.
What Rosselli told the federal
grand "jury about the Frontier, in
1971 is unknown. Rosselli didn’t:
testify later at the trial at which-
Anthony J. Zerilli and Michael: Pol-
izzi and the. Emprise Corp., among :
: others, were convicted. 4 :

ZERILLI and Polizzi are still in
jail. In 1973, the House of Repre-
sentatives Select’ Committee on
Crime Probed the influence of or-
ganized crime in sports — and one
area they looked at was Emprise
and the Frontier Hotel case.

At the time of the conviction, the
‘federal prosecutor asked that Poliz-
.2i and Terilli be jailed. immediately,
‘because monitored, . wiretapped

conversations showed that the two
had talked about “murder, the kill-
ing of certain individuals.”

. An intimate associate of Rosselli,
however, discounts the possibility
that Rosselli's grand jury appear-
ance could have ied, to his death.
-“They know Johnny didn’t talk ‘to
the grand jury,” the associate said.

JOE BREEN said -Rosselli hadn't
been to Las Vegas for nine years,
that “he’s never even seen the gift
shop.”

: Since his prison ‘release and
move to Plantation, Rosselli. wasn't
trying to regain power; according
to his friends. “He had no muscle,”

said an. associate.“I can’t believel .

Rosselli was getting back into’ mob
stuff.”

But at the same time, ‘many of
the associates were surpised to
learn about Rosselli's recent visits
with alleged organized crime fig-
ures on the West Coast.

Several associates speculate that
: Rosselli wanted to get involved in
: casino gambling, preferably in the
“Middle: East,. and was looking for:
someone with. maneyato back him.

“aMy IMPRESSION:was that he

was: broke,’ Mor id. “He told
me last ¥ ‘Vin_in. bad... financial.
. Scheer said Rosselli’ s income in-
cluded about $60,000 from the gift
shop and about $3,500 in social se-
curity, most of which went for
back fees to attorneys and for gov-
ernment fines. - .

HWY 50955 Docld:32423630 Page 682

" One friend said, that’ just “before
Giancana’s death, Rosselli had ac--
cepted Giancana’s. offer of money.
The friend was to act as.the inter-
mediary. “Let me figure out what.
my next (attorney's) tab will: be,”
the friend. quoted Rosselli as say-.
ing. .

Rosselli is. described. as a man
with a sense of humor who did lit-’
tle offending. .

A California woman- who had
known Rosselli-for about 40 years:

.told ‘The Herald, “If you were.
around him for 30 minutes you'd

like him because he would regard
you as a human being.” :

“If you had a headache he would

_either get you an aspirin or send

someone to get one. I said: some--

. thing significant there — he would

get it or he would send someone —
he wasn't a pansy, but he wasn’t a
tough guy either.” '
