is to éelineste an operational plea for the action which we.

future. In ‘summary the plan provides for ccatinuing, even
- intensifying, the intelligence effort sgeinst Cuba and for
the reorientation of the current effort into » long tera

denied ares type of operation of the highest priority.

i. ASSUMPTIONS:
A, The United States Government will give public
, assurances that, provided no nuclesr or offensive weapons re ,

B, These assurances will preclude any ‘meaningful CIA

: action ‘on a phased basis ‘to provoke a revolt inside Cube, since

unless ‘there are major changes in operational and internal con-

: ditions: in Cuba, ‘such a- revolt Af provoked would be totally

destroyed by Cuban | Sounteraction in a matter of hours or, ot

es a practical matter’ will, preclude invading Cuba on’ the pretext
- ‘ofia contrived provocation such es an attack on Guantanamo.

ag a aatter of. ‘policy.

De The Castro-communist regine will remain in power for

ithe indefinite future with its security and control apparatus
relatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing

unsupported resistance activity, ‘but of making operational

: conditions io Cuba increasingly difficult. While it is

possible that recent and future developments including the

Soviet action in removing the offensive weppons: trom Cube mey

7 serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there is as yet no hard

indication that the: control of the Castro-comnunist regine over

. Cuba has been substantially weakened,

The, United States ‘assurances of. no invasion ‘and no

Castro and his regime a certain degree of senctuary, This will

This. 46 an unrealistic objective, however, except. on a very

in Ats overt, dealings with the Cuban, exiles probably will not —

ie above, factors to then, an the context or with the

“ pluntness stated here.

°@.. ‘In view of these factors, the so-called “Irazck Tyo",

. course of action, 1.e., unlimited support of Cuban exiles

and_exile groups with no real control or objective purposes
' in ‘the hope that these groups will be able to shake the

Castro regine will, although unrealistic, become ineressing ty
Sttractive at various levels in the United States Government.

A. As & “matter of policy, political pressures ond —

i : " economie pressures, short. of blockade raids, and ‘aggressive

sabotage against Cuba will ‘be. continued.

Regardless of what other pressures are placed on CIA for -
action against Cuba, it would rppesr clear that Higher Authority
wild insist on 2 continued, even intensified, intelligence

‘coverage of Cuba.

“tg, view of ‘the policy fectora, an iocreased use of

: factiitien, real estate and basing outside the United Btates,

desirable:

Ke Adequate aerial reconnaissance of Cuba will continue.

“Based on the above sesumptions, the following objectives
‘appear to be proper for continuing CIA operations against
Cuba:
A Take all feasible clandestine action to isolate
and assist in isolating the Castro-communist regime in Cubs
from. the rest of the Western Hemisphere and the rest of the
‘ Free World. )
“B To. the maximum extent. t possible, discrevit the Castro- .

Set out below sro specifics of operational action it is
proposed to take to continue ond, as possible, incresse {n-
telligence coverage of Cubs. .
i. intelligence Exploitation < of Refugees: As you
know, with the quarantine and the cessstion of sir

/ travel the heavy’ flow of Cuban refugees has dwindled

“almost. to nothing. In view of this and in connection

‘
14-00000

“with the contingency plenning for supporting any Poreible
mijlitary action in Cuba, the Opa-Locks: Interrogation “
; Center as such was dismantled,’ ‘although. the personne)
of the ‘Center have been retained intact. In order to

s Havana -to Miami. This should be done ss soon aa .
S possible after the settlement of. the current negotintions

and UN discussions. Coincident with this, _the Opa~Locka
"refugee Anterrogation center will be re-esteblished

made, to continue to exploit to the fullest, preserve the
Z viability of. and, where necessary, re-catablish conmunica-
an ot tions. with the 131, recruited ‘agents now resident in Cuba,

) Cuban security end control sction, which it is impossible
. a8 yet to accurately forecast.
8. Third Country Operations: The priority on re-
cruiting agents in third countries for dispatch to Cuba
> will be reiterated and strengthened and every effort
will be made. to increase this coverage, both. through

‘the. Asvelopment of additional resident agents in Cubs

the {inison services who are rssisting us in the effort
against Cuba for additional coverage, including the
recruiting of egents within their own rrens for joint

operating at this poinat in this connection are the

approaches to several of these Services) either by you
personally or in your name, ps you prefer, sre

In addition, we will re-survey 11 other diaison sarvices ~~
. with which we are in contact and reiterate to those
appearing ‘to have any assets useable against Cuba our
extreme interest in maximum coverage of this problem.

our present CIA Close Support coverage from the KOLA
station in Winmd at the same Level end will continue
to press HSA for cdditionsl coverage of Cuban comauntcr-
tions. As the current situstion “nermelizes" it should

be possible for NSA to reinstitute and perhaps even

‘increase their seaborne intercept coverage of: Cuban

9. Communist Party Operations: A complete survey
has been made world-wide of all Communist Party

penetration operations and wherever any such penetration

can be directed ogainst Cuba either by dispatching the

sgent to Cuba or by pointing the agent agsinst Cubsrn
targets, this will be done, except in those cnses wheres
such action would result in unneceptabldprejudice te
the operations in the srex where the ngent is now based.
It is believed that the most lucrative field for the
redirection of such operations to the Cuban target will
be Latin America where there sre 65 penetrations of
various communist parties. Of this 65, the survey

we have conducted indicates that 23 have some direct

pertinent access to Cuban targets. All of these 22 wil!

be directed against these targets unless in uny case

examined to see if they can be diverted to Cuban trrgets.

/As feealhble, we will act to mount ss much ef this effort es

possible from areas outside the continental United States, end
particularly fron Latin America. If Higher Authority decides

“on | a “Track Two" concept. or on. any, ‘pimilar concept which

“contemplates heavy uncontrolled and only generally directad

section operations of Cuban groups against Cubs, it is belleved

that’ efforts should be mado to: transfer as much as possible
) of the responsibility, for this non-Clandestine, non~intel ligence

“type. operation into the political field, which is the province

. (of the Department of State. _In this connection, it is believed

for the most intensive feasible collection of intelligence,
the implementationof releted programs as outlined, and the

and wake ndvisrble the following:

B, Consideration of the re-positioning of Task Force W

within the Clandestine Service, possibly es s major coaponent
