Richtrich, ‘may Serlal Number 0377220, which revealed
ne adverse information mr ding Subject. it was -ene
tioned, however, by four riants that Subject's father
was suspecscd of having pro-Sermian leenings during “orld
War #1, but these suspicions were not verified by the f

Fospect to records of iis virthplace. Subject stated that: :
he had no birth certiPicate and had moved from Chituahua j :

one or two years of are. Subject stated that he hed never - .

Subject stated Murther that he gave his e :
birthplace as Yillmox, Arizona on his application fer ene } . .
listment in ROTS to eliminate conflict with any previous : .
records which wouldé.then require a..-% of “red tape” in : ; .
making what ke considered then a minor discrepancy of no { ° .
consequence, inasmuch a3 his father'a neturalizgation autos ® :
matically made him (Subject) a citizen of the United States. — .

Xt was the opinion of the offfloer mekin: the
above report on Subjuct!s birthplace, that any confiicting!
records of Subjeot's nirthplace was not due to any motives —
of subterfue, but was :iost probably due to Subject's desire ‘
