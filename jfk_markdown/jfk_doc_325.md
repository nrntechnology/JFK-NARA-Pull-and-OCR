MEMORANDUY FOR: Deputy Chief, Nestern Ilenisphere Division
suBJEcT ;

Dr. “anuel Artine Ruesa.

-1. Dr. Manuel Artine Bucsn has been a close friend of
mine since wo first set in Nicaragua in late 1966 or’ carly
1967. It was as a result of Artine's revelations at that
tine that wo recoveree several tons of A'SORLD arns and
munitions which had been secretly buried at Fl Blatt. |
last sar Artine in Tegucigalpa in July or the first days of
August 1972. .

4 2. Artine's husiness activity has narrowed down pretty
much to exporting neat fron Central Anerica and arrancing its
importation into the tmited States at Mani. Wis priccipal
artner abroad is General Anastasio Sonoza Debayle of Nicaragua.
on not sure with whem he deals in the U.S. althowceh he has
mentioned on a couple of oceasions a business connection with
Edgord Buttarri (not sure of this svelling) who, in turn, is
‘supposed to be ticd in with "Bebe" Nebozo. have. also heard
Artine. riention the “United States ‘eat Company” or the “Aner-
. dean Meat Company" (not sure which) as an importer of his
| Nicaraguan meats. ;

7 3. Artine was quite active durine the past year trying
. to get a meat export business going in ilonduras. Acting in
concert with Sonoza, and using to sore extent the Honduran
‘ _ gguimece tons of Teofilo Cnar Rabun Franco (another close friend
_of mine),
ing facility at fuerte Artnro an the north coast of Henduras
near Tela. The srineiysi motivating force in this Nonduran
venture was to hove been General Oswaldo Lopes Arellane. After
repeated attempts te pet the business rolling, Artine threw un
> his,hands in discuat abewt July 1972 owing to Lonez' failura to
. earry through on the Vonduran ond. Artime told ne that Lopez
. was "crazy". and “ahnornal" (Artime is: psychiatrist) and that

1. Attached (USC) for the information of Headquarters is a
copy of a memorandum prepared for the LNPURE Chief on 12 May 1969.
This mezorandum sets forth information rece: ved that day by the
COS from AMBIDDY-1 who is considering going into a dry dock venture
in Corinto with Jose Maria ZELAYA, private secretary to President
Somoza. ZELAYA has cabinet rank. He is believed by many to be
pro-Communist although, as in the caze of similar reports about

Francisco J. LAINEZ, no real proof of these allegations seems to
be produced. . : t
2. When shown this memorandum, the LNPURE Chief said he i
thought it quite likely that ZELAYA is strongly anti-American :
as reported by AMBIDDY. ty
3. AMBIDDY says that for the first time he recently heard 7
Somoza utter unfavorable words about the United States and : :
AMBIDDY “wondered” to the COS if ZELAYA could be exerting some i.
evil influence on Somoza. i

The Ambassador 12 May 1969
Political Attaché
Statements of Jose Maria "Chema" ZELAYA

1. n 12 May I was contacted by a close friend of mine
who is engagec in negotiations with “Chema" ZELAYA which
may lead to the twe forming a business partnership. ‘hile
gy source is not normally a source of intelligence informa-
tion, I have found him to be a good observer and to be
Feliable. He told me that ZELAYA told him the following
at a meeting on 9 May. . .
2. The ROCKEFCLLER visit is merely a political maneuver
on the part of President NIXON to furnish an excuse if
anything goes wrong in Latin America. It is preposterous
to expect Governor ROCKEFELI.ER to learn anything about a .
count in twenty four hours. ROCKEFELLER will go back to -
the United States, make his report to NIXON, and then go about
hRhie.normal duties. NIXON will adopt those recommendations
regarding U.S. policy for Latin America that are agreeable
to him, paying no attention to the rest. If anything goes
, weong, NIXON can pin the blame on ROCKEFELLER. In this way
- he has a scapegoat and also has an opportunity to lessen the
‘ss prestige of a potential political rival. Wo possible good can
4 come from this mission.

3 3. ZELAYA said that he has managed to obtain the blessing
(bendicién) of the Catholic Church. Now he is working on
. the blessing of the American Ambassador. In this respect he.
’ thas proposed setting up youth centers around the country--
.. places where youngsters can go to read food books, play :
_. ping pong, etc. -- and the American Ambassador is interested.

: 4. My friend is of the opinion that ZELAYA is strongly

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

romised to contact me again on his next trip to Managua.
je phoned se on 28 April. I picked him up that night

and drove him up to my nouse where we hada long conversaq-:
tion over a couple of steaks and a good bottle of wine.

SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa : ; 7 :
“de On 18 April I saw Subject again briefly and. i .

- told him that I would appreciate an opportunity to talk i

to him alone, As he was about to leave town, he i

%, ~.X told Subject that I had heard his.name mentioned
in connection with such unsavory. activity as fomenting
evolution in Panama and narcotics trafficking--from people | -
who don't know him. My reply to any auch dirty-mouthing .
is that Subject is a hyperactive type who keeps in contact
with all. sorts of people, some of whom may be involved in.
_ unsavory activity. This coes not. mean Subject is involved. ©
Indeed, I was sure he was not. : .

8, The provocation yielded desired resulta and.in. -
the ensuing conversation Subject gave me a detailed. .
explanation of his: present activities and financial situaticr.,

&. His business dealings are carried on under:his |
: company, known as Central. South International, Ina.. ‘Ha is:
: harp and his wife is secretary. His busizess activity
in Nicaragua consists of : =~ . Co

1 @e Sales of equipment to the National Guard

», Sates .of Livestock (cows) to Nicaragua. These
dealings are nandled through Colinel Guillermo |
NOGUERA, the buye> at this end. Subject .
expects to expanc this Lusiness to inelude sales’ .
to INFONAC--tne Naticral Davelogment Commission.

Subject obtaine the livestock from the '

Montura Ranch of Florida. -

e@. Sales of Florida real’estate. . . . . .
Subject is not licensed to make such sales
in the U.S. but can sell to persons abroad.
(About two years ago he was selling lots
west of Miami near where a new airport is

‘to be built.) . :

8S. Subject is now involvede-on thie tripe-in a deal
| with President SOMOZA to furnish well drilling and pumping
. @quipment for an agricultural irrigation syatem, SOMOZA’
| . was approached. by a British firm which somehow wangled a U.S.-
aranteed $ 1/2 parcent loan.to underwrite the same scheme.
is low interest was better than Sudjeet's contacts could
’ ebdtain initially and it appeared that the contract would
go to the British outfit. However, Subject's stateside | :
partner, a South Carolina legislator (atate leval), who .
i

Operates a businesa known as INTERGROW, managed to swing
the same deal ard was due in town on 24 April to talk with
. SOMOZA. SOMOZA told Subject he would give the business to
- Subject if he and hie ZNTERGROW friend could equal the British .

- offer. As of 28 April prospects for conaumation of a deal
leeked good.

: 6. Subject is also trying to work out a deal with

SOMOZA regarding export of Nicaraguan meat. Previous

dealings with a man from S&W fell through when thie chap

tried to "go around" Subject by dealing direct with Nicaraguan

meat exporters. At present Subject ia dealing with SOMOZA

to buy meat from CARNIC and IFAGAN to 9e11 in Miami to

the Northwestern Meat Company, owned by Eipidio NUNEZ. In.

return for his cooperation in the meat business, SOMOZA is

to be given a 38% slice of the profita, The remainder would

be split up as follows: 16% to Edgarda BUTTARI, 13% to
CONDOM, and 33% te Subject. SOMOZA is trying to

figure out some way to get his bite without paying U.S.

income taxes so the matter of spreacing the profits is still

up in the air. Central South international inc. has an

account at tie Capital National Bank oF Miami; Subject showed

me an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $48,000

issued by this bunk to be used for tha meat export deal.

- Subject says has been involved in narcotics trafficking,

23.

7. As for possible sales of cattle to INFONAC, .
Subject is working on a deal with SOMOZA which may
involve as much as a million and a half dollars.

6. Subject lives on commissions. He is now in
debt to the tune of $9,500 of which he owes $1,600 to
American Express and $3,900 to SOMOZA. When he has been.
down and out three persons have helped him with handouts
of money to tide him over. These are Sixto MESA, in
the construction business in Miami; Jose Luis GONZALEZ,
in the lumber business; and "Tacho" SOMOZA. Subject plans
to pay back all three every.cent they have given him. He
considers these handouts as loans. He is now trying
to consolidate his debts through. a loan from Diners Club.
He is paying on his home mortgage at a rate of S 3/% percent,
quite low by present-day standards. Two Cuban Negro friends
of many-years standing live with him at his home. . They
are taxi drivers and each pays $25 a week to help defray
household costs. One of these loyal retainers fired the
first shot during the Pilon sugar mill raid pulled off by
Subject's followers several years ago. 7

9. Contrary to popular belief, Subject does not own
a piece of the Vizcaya restaurant in Miami although he —
could have been a partner had he made a $500 investment
when the enterprise began. The owners are Oscar VILA, _
Aramis PINON, and the cook, named Tom&s (1nu). VILA
and PINON were with Subject in the Bay of Pigs invasion
and both are old friends. VILA. has been rumored involved
in narcotics but Subject doesn't think he is. Some time
ago the Miami Herald sent its lady gourmet: reporter to do a
story on the Vizcaya. She found it to her liking and wrote
a favorable story but some unidentified character at the.
Herald told her that narcotics were pushed at the Vizcaya.

- and that Subject was one of the owners. Publisher KNIGHT

of the Herald had an investigation run before allowing the
gourmet reporter’s story to be printed. The restaurant
was given a clean bill of health and the story was run.

26. One of tha persons most prominently involved in
biaackening Subject’s name is Rolando MASFERRER. Subject
Classifies him as the scum of Batista's Cuba. One gets the \
impression that Subject would be unhappy if MASFERRER, who ‘i

were to say anything good about him,

: 11. Subject's. only other possible connection with

4 narcotics involves a report he gave to Mr. DREW of the ‘

‘ FBI. This was as follows: Subject has a friend naned _

i “Carlos ARMAS who is skipper of a shrimp boat the "Sea ; ’

1 Cat". ARMAS lives at 1800 NW 34th Street, Miami. At sea . .

\ in British waters (around some British island or cay, in the : :

i Caribbean). ARMAS ‘has "fraternized” with a Cuban shrinver | — — .

i "El Costero” captained by Antonio LOPEZ. LOPEZ has told . .

| ARMAS that his boat,."£l Costero", often carries aboard a { .

| small, very fast speedboat. While anchored in Sritish waters :

i thie speedboat, with a crew of 3, is put overboard with a

| "package" on board. It disappears only to return sometime

| later minus the package but with large quantities of mony.
It then refuals from "El Costero" and heads for Cuba on its
Own power. Subject and ARMAS think it probable that the <
package contains narcotics and that Fidel CASTRO is raising
money this way. Mr. DREW of the FBI told Subject to tell
his story to the Coast Guard. Subject did but the CG said
they were not interested because the smuggling was taking
place in Sritish waters, As far as Subject knows nothing has

& Keeping’ about 200° men ("ay action men") ready -
for action in case of a sudden change in Cuba
or a "go ahead" on raids against Cuba.

Keeping on good terms with Edgardo. BUTTARI and.
Frank CONDOM who are both on good terms with
"Bebe" REBOZO who is in turn, an intimate
friend of President NIXON. (Subject asked me
not to discuss or report this owing to its
political sensitivity. It would seem prudent
not to accentuzte this matter).

: Ge Keeping geod relations with Nicaragua and
Haiti for possisle future operations againet
i ba. . . .

The Station has seen a copy of an FBI report

1969, concerning AMBIDDY-1, which indicates, among other
things, that AMBIDDY reportedly claimed to have arranged an.
interview with Mr. Richard NIXON at the time the latter was a
presidential candidate. Since the content 2nd tone of this
FBI report differ somewhat from what the COS, Managua, has

i | - MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
, SUBJECT: Manuel ARTIME Buesa “ a =

1. ARTIME comes to Managua frequently, always using : .
LANICA Airlines and frequently flying over Cuba. He is i
aware of the pessibility of a highjacxing and says that he
would never make it cut of the Havana airport alive if
the CASTRO Government were to get hold of him.

One of his enterprises lies in obtaining fatigue uniforms,
eanteens, web gear, and similar equipment and supplies
for the Nicaraguan National Guard. Another enterprise,
in which he was involved a year or so ago, involved lumber
and cabinet woods which he hoped to export from Nicaragua
to the States. He dealt with a Nicaraguan businessman =
named MOLINA in this matter. It seems to have fallen through.
At one point last year (1968) I heard that ARTIME was trying
to serve as middleman for investments by KRUPP interests in
- Germany here. I. have heard no more about this. A more
recent line is Nicaraguan beef for export to the States.
. He says that he has made contact with’ the tcp man of the.
- .§ & W restaurants in the States, This man, after checking
> gamples of Nicaraguan beef, says he will buy all -‘he can get.
The supplier at thi end would be CARNIC, a meat. packing
enterprise owned. by President SOMOZA. . (There is no doubt’
- _ARTIME could find a ready market in the States but he may
- be stymied by the import quotas, especially since Nicaragua
“: ever-exported to the States in 1968 and had troubles as. a
* gveault. : Coe .

2. He explains his trips as legitimate business. ’ |

; 3. ARTIME drops by to see me at ny home often although
not on every trip. His vidits to ae have basa less frequent

He is usually accompanied by Jose FERNANDEZ de la Torre,

. Manager of Distribuidora Inter-Anericana, S. As "Pepe" : ,

, is a Cuban and a close friend of mine. ‘ie is ARTIVE's , i
elesest friend in Nicaragua. ARTIME often stays at his Ho:
home. On a couple of occasions A®TIME has been by to i .
gee me with another mutual Cuban friend, Primitivo . : ,

ABLANEDO,who used to live at £1 Bluff on the Last Coast. . i ’
"El Gallego" ABLANEDO new. lives in Managua‘and makes his: . SG
living renting out dump trucks and construction and hauling ' i
equipment. On one occasion ARTIME came by with a Cuban I i :
believe was named VILA. Mirta PADRON, another mutual
Cuban friend (she teaches Spanish at the American Embassy)

. tells me that VILA owns a restaurant in Miami but that
ARTIME has no. connection with this enterprise. A couple
of times ARTIME.has come by with Frank CONDOM, & short,

uiet, red-faced Cuban who owns some jewelry stores in
ami, CONDOM 1s now pretty well-off financially and is
a good friend and business associate of "Bebe" REBOZO,
who, in turn, is a close friend of President NIXON. . L-
belleve CONDOM and, perhaps REBOZO, may be involved in the
meat deal. ne

: 4%. ARTIME always comes with sor-eone when he visits
meeenot because he feels need for a bodyguard as some
suspect, but simply because he still doesn't know how to
drive a car and I live some distance out of town. Our
‘visits are pleasant, involve a scotch or two at most.
The last two times ARTIME.has not had anything. to. drink.
' We talk no operations or other such business. ‘My ‘personal
. views on dealing with CASTRO, especially on howwe should
~~ have dealt with him in the past, are rather hawkish and I
.. think ARTIME finds these views pleasant to his ear although
he is well aware that they are not "policy." :

: §. ARTIME told me some months ago--before the elections--
of meeting with "Bebe" REBOZO, The meeting was arranged

“ through CONDOM. ARTIME has not claimed te me to have met with
Mr. NIXON either before or after he assumed the presidency. |
He has made it known, as is already well known, that REBCZO --
ds close ts the President. fie has aiso speculated that —-
REBO4Z0 might have considerable say in formulation of the new

| adninistration's Cuban policy. He expects this polic;
to ve more hard-line out has not specifically said that
RE30Z0 has said this would be so. we recently told me
that some of my ideas on enforcing the economic blockade . ’
had been passed on to RE30Z0. .

6. In response to my queries as to what direction
the new Cuba policy might take, ARTIME said in March 1969
that he did not expect the NIXON administration to, address
itself to the Cuban problem before ‘ay of this year. :
Then he expects a concerted effort to make the economic : ,
blockade work. If that does not yield results, he expects : ‘
that a go-ahead will be given for the resumption of Cuban .
exile raids against Cuba from non-U.S. bases. He hopes te.
“be the man chosen to lead in this endeavor. -Again, in
response to my questions, he said that exiles could be
trained in Nicaragua. He favors using Haiti: as the actual
base of operations, i.e., the raiding parties would leave:
from there. He mentioned having talked with President
DUVALIER and indicated that he has DUVALIER's approval for.

such operations.

. 7. ARTIME said that operations against Cuba would be
@esigned to knock out shipping and port facilities. .He.
has not recently referred to his earlier invasion plan
as outlined in MANAGUA 6752 of 23 October 1968.

8. ARTIME is still. as charming as ever, lot's of fun
to be around socially--full of jokes, anecdotes, etc. -
He has not lost faith, is one of the few of what have been.
termed slsewhere "the old exile hacks" who have net given
up. He really does’ seem determined to play a leading role
in unseating CASTRO. he is beginning to go to fat a bit.
I saw him in a bathing. suit not long ago and thought that
he would do well ‘to get into trim if he hopes to lead in
any military operation. : .

- 9. ARTIME has never made any discernable efforts to

| poy secrets from: me; indeed, he sews: to have taken special
Pains not to do 80. He is mature and quite ebjective--car |
see various facets to just abeut any problem. I believe

_ &¢ is well worthwhile maintaining ecsasional contact with
hin. ,

DISPATCH [ose =

: a Chief, Western Hemisphere Division , x
ero. — n=

oy H

1. As usual the first month of 1969 featured a large number of rumors
waking the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile community. While. we normally tend:
to ignore such rumors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they

_ Yelate to GPVALIANT. .

2. The first of these rumors deals with a_new group which has pre-
sumably been formed for the purpose of trying to dea] through GPVALIANT,
Among those in the group are Carlos Prio, Lincoln Rodon, Juan J. Remos,
Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari. This group reportedly. meets every Thurs-

. day at different houses: The last meeting in January was held at the home
of Lincoln Redon. At this meeting Prio presumably stated that Butari was
a better contact to GPVALIANT than is Emilio Nunez Portuando. The general

- consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business
partner of Bebe Roboso and everyone knows Reboso's influence with GPVALIANT.

- The rumor will has it that the group intends to pretend that it “avors
political and democratic: solutions to the PBRUMEN preblem but that they
really seek armed intervention. In this same connection Father O'Farril

- has recently told AMPALM-4 that AMBIDDY-1 is once more connected with WOFIRM
and that AMCORE-2 has joined him.. The rumor mill says. further that AMBIDDY-1
and AMCORE-2 are planning to open training camps once again with the tacit

> encouragement of the-above group. According to AMPALN-4 O'Farril himself ©
does not agree with the version of AMBIDDY-1 and AMCORE-2 wanting to estab-
lish training camps. O'Farril feels that the solution AMBIDDY-1 is looking
for is through agreements between LNFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union.

3. WIBALDA has picked up information quite similar to that learned —
through AMPALM-4. He also has reported the existence of this group and
_ gaid that they are collecting money from the refugees in order to buy arms
. and equipment to ovezihrow AMTHUG-1. According tc WIBALDA important mem-
- pers of Alpha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticor, and Ortedoxos are in-
volved even though these organizations themselves are not participating
 @S groups in the move.«nt. ; a :

4. Another rumor has it that AMOTEX-S9 is. also conspiring in
plans for future arned action against PBRUMEN.

S. The ubove information is being forwarded strictly as unfounded
‘and unconfirmed rumors. We are passing it along only because it represents
another indication of what the exiles are expecting from GPVALIAST. Ke --
find the rumor concerning AMBIDOY-1 particularly interesting and suspect -
that it may be an outgrowth of the recent report we have received fros
AMCHALK-1 that AMBIDDY-1 has been contacted by ACSI.

conspirator in an atte: revolution and
for having been involved in the clandestine
movezent of revolutionaries across the
Costa Rican border. :

b. Jose FERNANDEZ de la Torre
On 2 March 1962 a report said he was a Cuban

: refugee who talks anti-Communist but was us .
: actually sént to Nicaragua to make Communist . . a
: propaganda. On 8 May 1965 he vouched for the. . :
i entry into Nicaragua of Jesus FERNANDEZ Suarez, - . :
a Cuban (no OSN or Station traces). Ciore: ,

FERNANDEZ is known personally to ZABOTH and to
the Chief of Station, whose opinions about tim
are that he is a Cuban businessman who is
both anti-Communist and anti-Castro because of
the loss of his business interests in Cuba. | .
His principal business in Cuba involved dise
tribution of the products of Procter and Gaable, : t
the soap and chemical company. He is now -
manager of Distribuidora Inter-Americana S.A.,: : .
an import/export and distribution firm in . Lo
Managua.) On 18 January 1967 the Guatemalan

- Security Service requested traces on the subject, . :
@long with a list of other Cubans. No reason : :
for the request was given to OSN. i : : ;

@. Orlando CASTRILLO S., Bachiller
On 20 November 1965 he wrote a letter to La
Prensa, the opposition newspaper in Managua, : ‘
asking them for 30,000 copies of an anti-SOMOZA : ! coe

3. Both ZABOTH and the Chief of Station have discussed ;
with AMBIDDY-1 the "intelligence net" mentioned by the reference.
The stated Station position was "we are happy to maintain con-
tact with you and to discuss this matter from time to .time on an }
informal and personal basis, but the policy of our organization 5
is that we do not engage in intelligence activities in a friendly ‘
country except in coordination with the local government. ~
Therefore, even though you asgure us that General SOMOZA knows :
and approves this activity, we would have to have a direct ree i
quest from him before we could cooperate with you in any kind ot
of an official mpacity." ‘This appears to. have sufficled to keep. |:
our lines open to those involved without committing us to de
anything more than listen. :

Dear Jin:

I have delayed the trip to Nicaragua until Wednesday oe
the 24th or Thursday the 25th, because the Nat Harrison
Coupany, which is financing ny trip, wants me to take
some documents to Managua.

I am sending you: the signed reciept herewith,
It looks like Roberto (our friend over there) wants.

Ablanedo to stay ‘on for a complete month in Nicaragua. ge
If it is going to be that way then I will need the money
for ‘this month also. If he stays it is because Roberto
orders him, and if Roberto orders him to stay, then
‘Roberto should pay.! : .

Pardon ay latetess in writing to you but I have had to face

QeMany of the good men who cave the Somoza's advice were intinate

‘friends of Luis and they are afraid of coming to Tacho in order to

give hin advice,

3-The Communists are. aware of this and they are also aware of the
fact that Tacho ts even score violent than Luis, therefore, they take
advantage of the situation to provoke Tacho, thereby hoping that

without Luis's advisors and possibly with ‘the "bad advice" of "an

but it could develop into a probles, if the Communists exploit

it skillfully. ,

J-I also think that the Security Corps which continues to function
under the orders of Montiel, who is also chief of Statt and also . ‘
@ merchant, loses al} its efficiency because of the fact that Montiel
cannot dedicate sufficient time to the Corps and as a result leaves

ite direction to Captain Willop, who I think is entirely incompetent
for the job.

6-3 think that the only good thing that panorama has is the loyalty ,
of General Sonosa's military troops,- for T honestly do not trust

received the proposition to ‘study ‘on a scholarship in Russia, at :

the Patricio Lumumba University » and she is willing to collaborate

Dear Jin,

‘Pardon wy lateness in writing, but I have had to run around

a lot, The fundamental subjects which I wished to discuss
are.

1. Iwas displeased when our Nicaraguan friend discussed
the subject of the implements which we had in Blueffield
with General Somoza before I had discussed anything with
him (Genral Somoza); above all without even consulting
with me before he went ahead and did it, this put me in
a difficult. position with the Government. This is what I
discussed wit! Carlos:

(a) The com ne me om @) I will
tell Somoza vate Wey teM (c) I move them to
; enother place which is less accessible. — ‘le. agreed with
me on consulting with the company, and the answer he gave

- to (b) was that THB he planted the "other friend" in with
Somoza, and nothing else was said. Thank God tmt I did
all on that job, and I did pass some unpleasant moments.
2.During Somozas’ stay in the USA I have seen him frequently
‘and I have taken American investors, who wish to put their

" enpisal to work in Nicaragua, to.see him, We have conversed
sopiously about his projects. He wants to do the following:
, ‘urn over his power when his mandate is terminated. Raise”

” the standard of living for the Nicaraguans, Give the

farmers the chance to take their Products to big markets,

through the construction of highways, silos to store graing

and favorable legislation for the small farners, The

only thing that worries me is the extraordinary influence

that "Che Lainez" has on him in economics, There are

diverse comentaries about this individual on whether he ig

Communists. :

“3. Somoza has promised me to continue to move the subject
of Cuba in the ir. ternational | ‘spheres, and in his appearance

in “deet the Press" he has already done it.

4. There is a "GARCIA" who is a syndicate leader of the

that I can get some good information for you (plural). —

is going to bring ab:ut probleas with the old guard of the

Dear Jin:
Just a few lines to report the following:

al I believe that Communism will concentrate on Nicaragua as

-@ point of attack.

9. ‘The men who have returned to Nicaragua after receiving

7 training in Cuba only acted indirectly in the bloody events -

; of the 22nd, because according to information gathered io

. ‘Micaragua through "Pepe Fernandez,” the “gandinistaa” communists”

. (aho follow the Castro line) were avaiting the assassination
“of the Souoza in Leon and this was never realized (carried

eut). These men were expecting an outbreak before-‘tacho

Bomoza took over. the Preside::y of the Republic.

3. BS am structuring. (building) an anticommunist intelligence ~
net ‘in Nicaragua, which I have begun to instruct (train).

thie net is composed of: Jose Ferndndez ("Pepe" Ferndndez)

’ Manager of Casa Hook. Rodolfo Jerez, Owner of casa "Venu."

Capitalist of various enterprises. — ,
Orlando Castrillo ~- Studies law, 5th year (5?) year of | age

He has a grocery (foodstuffs) business.

Duilio Cabrera - Studies law, 4th year. Works in the Ministry

of Agriculture, in the Department of Live Stock. He is 25

“years old. |
14-00000

oe

-2-

Roberto Arellano - Studies law, 5th year. He works in the ‘
National Palace. Department of (Providad?). It ia a position
Je . related to employees and workers. He is 28 years of ag-.

, , Roberto Arias - Studies law, 6th year. Owner of an auto-

_ mobile spare parts business.

These individuals are going to create an anticonmun! et

intelligence net. I have already given them one week of
conferences.
4. According to reports received by Pepe, a Nicaraguan named
Gustavo Gomez Mesa, acquired through various subjects (persons),
about $5,000.00 in arms in Miami, from the Tamiami Gun Shop. :
The money was contributed by Aguirre, the owner. of “Diario.
de las Americas" (and director), through an individual named
Germéin Arellano. These arms were going to be infiltrated into
Wicaragua in small quantities at a time.
5. Today I received from Adolfo Jiménez (old chief of the

Camp "Francisco" of communications, of Costa Rica) the pro-
position to ask Nicaragua for permision to launch: the invasion

‘from there to Haiti. Accord-.ag to him thers is a-gzouz of

- Capitalists in New York who are willing to send trom Europe
* gpout $80,000.00 in arms, to any designated location in

, "“Wecaragua. -Z am attempting to find out the nanes vr these

"* gapitaliste so that I can report it. 1 have. replied that I
gill think the proposition over very cautiously bexore pre-

: gonting it te Nicaragua. or course, I will not get involved

i SUBJECT: © Termination of Manuel Artine Buesa ail oO ; ,
@ of Eat yO”

1, On the night of i3 Saguary 1967 the writer using
the operational alias James §..Wilson met with Artime in a
room in the Hotel Columbus in Miami, Florida. The purpose
of the meeting was to formally terminate Artime's association
with the Agency. This involved the obtaining of termination
Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover

‘the final periodical payment through 31 December 1966 and
obtaining outstanding receipts,

Re 2 een nr ont e te Rn rmaeer

‘2. The meeting was cordial and all paper work involved
in the proceedings was accomplished without: incident. There
was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what he had
done (or tried to do) for the Agency in the past and an un-
doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon me that he was ready

and willing for any task he might be called upon to do in
the future, . .

3.  Artime made only one request--a rather passionate
one--for financial assistance for the immediate family members
of two Movement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR)
members who were executed #5 the result of operational missions
to Cuba and the wife of anucher who is serving a 30-year
sentence. (It will be recalled that Artime has been furnishing
receipts for the $3,000 he has been receiving in recent months 2
claiming that the money goes to the families of MRR members — -

‘who have lost their lives or been imprisoned while on MRR
missions.) We are examining these three cases and if worthy
will arrange for financial benefits under the “survivors and
martyrs" section of the AMBUD activity.

4. Artime has a sterile Headquarters telepho~e number -
and a P.0. box address in Weehington, D.C, He was not * ucouraged
in maintaining a. locse contact by teiephone or correspondence :
if he had any items of interest to pass along and was assured ;
that if he over haa any “new” ideas, 1f he put them in writing,
they would be studied. It was, however, made very clear to

21. AMBIDDY-1 pave the following information to James D.
ZABOTi! in Managua on 15 December 1966 and was told to pass
it on to his ileadquarters contact for proper handling and
distribution. This report is forwarded as a follow-up in
ease the information failed to ret into proper channels, as
it has a direct connection with Reference A and is a sequel

_ to Reference 3.

. 2. Between 7 and 13 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked
three times with Frank MARSHALL, at the latter's request.
MARSHALL first called AMBINDDY-1 and asked if they could meet
at MARSHALL's office to talk about the possibility of MARSHALL
investing in the business proposition in which AMSIDDY-1 was.
involved. (A concession for a commercial record player with
a television type screen on which scenea are displayed which’ °
are supposed to be synchronized with the music.) . After two
euch meetings, which AMHIDDY~1 described as. “pet-acquainted®

and “feeling-out™ 9 sessions (the two men had never met in per~
son praviously) .. RSHALL asked if he could visit AMSIDDY-1
privately in his noted room, They met on 12 December 1966 at
AMBIDDY-1's suite in the Gran iHlotel in San Jose.

CONTINUATION OF ‘

3.. HARKSHALL said he knew ANSIDDY-1 had some weapons.
AMBIDDY-1 replied that tne weapons in sicaragua had peen .
‘given tc the “«icaraguan Governzent, Dut MARSHALL continued

.. to press the point, saying ne knew there sere otners.

AMBIDDY<1 at last reluctantly adaitted that he did have 2.
‘few more scattered around under tight security (he says:
‘ie not true, in fact), but indicated that he had other plans
for their use. MAXSHAL! cals he aid not care where they
_.were or what they cost, he would buy then. AMBIDDY-1 asked
him why he wanted weapons so badly, and! MARSHALL replied that
he was always in the market for weapons. _ AMBIDDY-1 said he
was aware of that fact, but this did not sound like just
another routine business deal. He went on to say that he
would not even consider releasing any of his arns without
knowing where they were going and for what use, and that he
had heard that MARSHALL had sold weapons previously to the
Communists. He would have nothing to do with su~h an opera-
tion, regardless of any possible profit in it. He tried to
elicit as much information as possible, but got very little.
MARSHALL said they had a common friend in General SOMOZA, to
which AMBIDDY-1 replied that this was fasrlv recent as SOMOZA
and MARSHALL had been bitter enemies up until about the last
_three years. AMBIDDY-1 said he had to know how many arms
were wanted, when, where, and for what purpose. MARSHALL said

he wanted all he could get, as soon as possible, in Costa Rica,

and the reason was that he knew a coup was being prepared and
he wanted to get his own people ready in time. AMBIDDY-1 said
he would have to think about the proposition and would give

him an answer in about three weeks. (He intends to stall and”
make no commitments, hoping to draw out more information. He
will not agree to sell any arms.) ,

&. On 7 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked with Daniel
ODUBER at the latter's office. ODUBER said he was worried
about all the talk of coup plotting, weapons and other indica-
tors of posaible violence. ODUBER again mentioned to AMBIDDY=1
that he had a finca on the Pacific Coast near the Nicaraguan
border which has an airstrip adequate for a Cat6 or CH47

aircraft, and made an effort to feel out AMBIDDY<-1 about
the possibility of landing arms on that airstrip. AMBIDD¥%-1
was noncommital and ODUBER did not press the point.

& AMBIDDY-1 said (as his opinion) that he had gotten
the impression from talking with MARSHALL and ODUBER that.

that he, ODUBER, can ztep.in at the right tine and clgia, thé:
Presidency. ODUBER considers Jose “Pepe* FIGUERLS to be -his

| ODUBER is pushing MARSHALL to stage a coup attempt in the hope
i

eain rival in auch a plan, however. He seems to think the
\g Rees edeinistration is doomed in a matter og time.
