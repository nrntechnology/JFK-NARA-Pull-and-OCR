On January 21, 1958, saqPovers ¥ the New York Office called
advising that his preliminary inquirfes at FiTst disclosed that such coverage
coukt possibly be effected at LaGuardia Airfield. Powers statéd that he subse uently
received a cali from the Chief Post Office Inspéctor who told him that he would not
be able to make such arrangements and explained that something had happened |in
Washington on a similar matter and that Bureau Headquarters should take up the
matter with Post Office Headquarters here in Washington. The Post Office :

i inspector said that it did not involve our agency and because of what. was going ,

‘on in Washington at the present time, he just couldn't do if on his own. ;
Almost simultaneous with this advice, Mr, James Angleton of CIA
| approached our Liaison Agent,(Sam Papich)jon a personal ‘basis. He indicated

that if it were known within CIA That he was volunteering this information to the
Bureau, he would lose his job. Mr. Angleton stated it had come to the attention

of CIA, through the Post Office,. that we were making inquiries concerning the |
| coverage of mail to the(U.S.5.R » and as a result CIA was expecting to receive

an inquiry in Washington from the FBI, Mr. Angleton then admitted that this

is an extensive and expensive operation, He indicated that they had to set up an
elaborate array of IBM machines to tally and tabulate the results. In addition
a complicated indexing procedure was involved, as well as complex scientific
I examinations of the material, ' He said two or three | hundred CIA employees ar Sane

| and in view of the volume of material being sent from the U.S., their coverage

exclusively engaged ¢ on yarious facets_o! of. ‘the > coverage, ‘Angleton also indicate
thatthe” cost ‘of thé oy “Operation was. well oy over a million dollars a year, He forth r
indicated that the < coverage has been in \"in existence ine excess of a year and he
stated-that the sole purpose for the cove) coverage “was toddentify persons behind the
Iron Curtain who might have some ties in the U.S. and who could be approached:
fin ‘their countries as ‘contacts and sources for CIA. Angleton indicated that C
‘Thad’ successfully developed several sources through this means. He stressed | --
the confidentiai nature of his information and stated that while other officials of
CIA more directly concerned with the coverage were expecting a visit from the’
FBS he was passing this along for our guidance.

.

it would appear that our inquiries of the Post Office officials in
New York have flushed out a most secret operation of CIA. The question
immediately arises as to whether CIA in effecting this coverage in New York
has invaded our jurisdiction. In this regard, it is believed that they have a
legitimate right in the objectives for which the coverage was set up, namely, —
the development of contacts and sources of information behind the Iron’ Curtain,
and-according to Angleton they have had some success: in this regard. At the’
same time, there is an internal security objective here in which, because of
our responsibilities, we have a definite interest, namely, the identification of
illegal espionage agents who may be in the United States, While recognizing’
. this interest, it is not believed that the Bureau should assume this coverage
because of the inherent dangers in the sensitive nature of it, its complexity,
size and expense, It is believed that we can capitalize on this coverage by’
pointing out to CIA our internal security objectives and holding them responsible
‘to share their coverage with us... Of course, we are not interested in the
identities of the numerous persons in this country eer tmately corresponding
abroad. The Post Office has indicated there are approximately four thousand

microfilming the contents and indexing pertinent data therein, Approximately oto

The absence of an asterisk in the "Ref" column after EVOSWA

The code key uged for this column is set out in Enclosure 4, You

The absence of an Xx" in the "Ban"! column means, that the letter

“going to and coming from the USSR. Arrangements for this ‘review sy
were obviously worked out between the Agency and Post Office ;
officials and we. are not privy to the details. :

It is obvious that both incoming and outgoing mail
is opened and photographed. At one time in March of 1961,
we were advised that CIA had established a laboratory in
New. York where they could examine correspondence for secret
writing,:microdots, and possibly codes, At that time CIA
offered to make these facilities available if we needed then,
During the same approximate time, CIA advised that about
500,000 items per month passed to and from the USSR] and about
200, 000 of these items are screened " Approxima ely 1,200 item
