PERSONNEL HR 20-53

53. CONTRACT PERSONNEL. This paragraph sets forth policy, authorities,
and responsibilities concerning the management of contract personnel. It does
not apply to consultants (see HR 20-52), to personal services acquired through
industrial or procurement contracts (see HR 20-55), to personnel employed by
proprietary projects (see HR 230-8), or to agents (see HR 20-54).

a. GENERAL. Thete are two eategoties of contract personnel: contract employees

and independent _contractors.

(1) CONTRACT EMPLOYEES. Although they are not appointed employees,
contract employees are employees of the U.S. Government. They have all
the rights and privileges granted by law to U.S. Government employees
in accordance with their citizenship status as well as those rights and
privileges specified in their contracts. They work under supervised con-
ditions and are compensated on a salary basis. Contract employees are
grouped into three categories:

who perform duties, usually of a clandestine and operational nature,
on a career basis. They are normally required to demonstrate their
operational value to the Agency for not less than three years, in the
case of U.S. citizens, or not less than five years, in the case of foreign
nationals, to qualify for career associate status. When it is necessary
for a career associate to have the staff-type access to an Agency instal-
lation or classified Information, he must meet the same security ap-
proval criteria as a staff employee.

(b) Internal (Type I) Contract Employees: Contract employees, engaged
for a specific period of time, who normally work inside Agency instal-
lations. They are required to meet the same security approval criteria

‘as staff employees, but are permitted only such access to classified
information as is authorized in their security approval and is required
in the performance of their duties.

. :
a

{c) External (Type E) Contract Employees: Contract employees, engaged

for a specific period of time, who normally work outside Agency in-
stallations. They are not required to meet the same security approval
criteria as staff employees and. are not permitted the same access
to Agency installations as staff employees or internal contract em-
ployees. They are permitted only such access to classified information
as is authorized in their security approval and is required in the per-
formance of their duties.

(2) INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS are not employees of the US. Government.
They are Self-employed individuals who are engaged under contract to

provide specific services. They receive only the compensation and benefits

considered necessary to retain their services. In the Operations Directorate,. ;
their duties are normally limited to historical research and analysis and.

to the direction, utilization, spotting, or support of agents. They normally

do not carry out espionage or covert action tasks. (Care: must be taken:

: to distinguish between independent contractors, defined herein, and | agents,
mo, . : defined in HR 20-54.)

. POLICY . .
(1) Contract personnel may be engaged when. : ua

i
| (a) it is necessary to provide for operational or support needs which can-
jo not be met through the use of available staff personnel;
i (b) services are- required of particularly well-qualified individuals who:
L cannot meet all requirements for staff employment;

r (ce) there is a requirement to meet operational needs without obligating .-
the Agency to long-term employment;

(a) the nature of the mission for which the individual is being engaged
precludes his being subject to administrative control or working spe- :
cifically defined hours; ;

(e) the individual’s primary employer or interest is not the Agency and :
the services the Agency desires from him are supplementary to his
primary interest or vocation; or

(f) there is a long term requirement for personal services which, for op-

J BF perational or security reasons, cannot be performed by Agency staff
eet : - personnel. , ; ;
(2) The engaging of contract personnel is subject to the following restrictions:

(a) New contracts, contract renewals, and contract amendments for in-
dividuals under current or anticipated nonofficial cover, must have
prior approval of the appropriate component of the Operations Direc-
torate. ce.

(b) Contract personnel may be engaged only for approved activities for . =
which funds have been made available. Funds for these activities will
be budgeted annually and will not exceed limitations imposed by the
head of the component concerned.

: (c) Contract employees are subject to directorate manpower controls and .

t : ; ceilings established by the Director of Central Intelligence during the
J . annual budgetary review cycle. Independent contractors are excluded
from ceiling controls.

(d) Contracts will, whenever possible, be written and signed. However,
when special security or operational factors prevent the execution of
a formal written contract, a memorandum in lieu of such a contract
may be prepared to document the commitments and obligations of the
Agency and the individual.

(d) Appropriate security or operational approvals will be obtained before
any contractual commitments are made to individuals and before any
disclosure to them of classified information.

(£) No commitments relating to the use of the services of an employee of
‘another Government agency will be made without prior approval of
the Operating Official or Head of Independent Office concerned and
the Director of Personnel.

(g) No commitments will be made to contract personnel that appointed .
employment status will be offered at the conclusion of or during any -
. period of their contract service; without prior approval of the Director
of Personnel and the Director of Security. .

(h) Contract employees must meet Agency medical standards prior to the.
i approval and authentication of their contracts. A psychological assess-
: 4 ment and psychiatric evaluation of those contract employees in whom ‘-
. the Agency may have more than a short-term interest will be carried
. out whenever feasible.

' (i) Independent contractors are normally not required to meet Agency
: : : medical standards; however, if their contract contains any provision
. which obligates the Agency to provide medical or. disability benefits.
a Satisfactory medical examination is required, to include a psycho-
yu logical assessment and psychiatric evaluation, | if necassary.

. POLICY

(1) Agents cannot claim rights and ‘privileges normally granted to U.S.
Government employees; therefore, they will not be managed in accordance
with normal personnel and administrative standards.

(a) Initial approval of the Counter Intelligence Staff is required before any

commitments are made or any classified information is disclosed to.

an agent.

(b) Agents will receive compensation, benefits, and emoluments in amounts
and a manner deemed best by the Operations Directorate to motivate
and control them, subject to the following limitations:

(1) No commitment may be made to an agent to provide gross com-
pensation (basic compensation, additional compensation, fees, etc.)
at a rate which, if projected on an annual basis, would exceed the
maximum rate for a GS-15, without prior approval of the Director.

This limitation applies only to payments made by the Agency. It .

does not apply to bona fide cover income.

(2) No commitment may be made to an agent to provide special bene-
fits, without the prior approval of the Director of Personnel. Special
benefits are Agency obligations other than basic compensation,

normal overseas cost of living payments, and travel or operational :

expenses.
(3) No commitment may be made to an agent that appointed status

will be offered at the conclusion of his service unless such com-"

mitment has been recommended by the Deputy Director for
Operations or his designee, with the concurrence of the Director of
Security, and has been approved by the Director of Personnel.
(c) Engagement of agents will not ‘be subject to Agency personnel ceiling
controls.

(d) In general,. agents will not be required to meet Agency medical stand-.

ards. However, if an agreement with an agent obligates the Agency
to provide medical or disability benefits, a medical examination will
be carried out, unless precluded by security considerations.

(e) Agents who are U.S. citizens, resident aliens, or foreign nationals in
the United States, must pay Federal tax on all income derived from
their association with the Agency. Procedures for satisfying Federal
tax liability will be “determined by. the Covert: Tax Board. (See BR
20-35.)

’ (f) The use of retired civilian annuitants ofthe U.S. Government as agents
will be governed by policy set forth in HR 20-13.

(2) Al commitments made or implied to agents will be recorded in either a

Formal Agreement or a Memorandum of Oral Commitment. .

(a) A Formal Agreement is.a written agreement, signed by the agent: and
an authorized Agency representative. Formal Agreements will be nego-
‘tiated whenever operationally feasible,

(b) A Memorandum of Oral Commitment is a written record of an agree-
ment, signed by an authorized Agency representative but not by the
agent. Use of Memorandums of Oral Commitment will be limited to
those cases when it is in the Agency’s best-interest not to solicit an
agent’s signature on a Formal Agreement.

(c) An agent will never be given a copy of the Formal Agreement or  Memo-
randum of Oral Commitment.

55. PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS FOR> THE SERVICES OF
INDIVIDUALS»

a. POLICY. Procurement contracts whose basic purpose is to obtain the services
of one or more individuals, negotiated with profit and nonprofit institutions,
associations, partnerships, proprietorships, and other organizations, are per-
mitted only when the particular services sought cannot be obtained in any
other practicable way.

b. PROCEDURES

(1) Except as provided in subparagraph b(3) below, all proposals for such
procurement contracts and their renewal must be justified in writing by
the component seeking the services and be submitted to the Director of
Personnel for his approval before commitments are made or negotiations
started. These proposals will describe in some detail the services to be ren-
dered, the qualifications required, the proposed duration of the task, and
the reason or reasons why a procurement contract is judged | fo be the
best method of acquiring the needed services.

The Director of Personnel will-ascertain whether any staff or nonstaff
personnel are available to perform the needed services. If not, he will
examine the feasibility of satisfying the requirement by hiring new per-
sonnel. If this latter course of action also proves impracticable, the Di-

’ rector of Personnel will approve the proposal and return it either to the

Office of Logistics or to the originator for subsequent submission of a con-
tract request to the appropriate procurement unit. Procurement contracts
are written under the authority of the Director of Logistics as stated in

. BR 45-2,

(3)

The approval of the Director of Personnel is not required

(a) for procurement contracts involving the services of individuals inci-
dental to research and development or the preparation of studies or.
reports, where the fee reflects an end product (a report written, a
.task performed, etc.) rather than a computation based mainly on
time (per hour, per man year); |

(b) for procurement contracts involving the purchase of equipment which

requires the services of experts or technicians in delivery, installation, .

testing, initial operation or maintenance, training, etc. However, any

follow-on contract for services only—such as maintenance or opera-—

tion—requires the Director of Personnel’s prior approval as set forth
above, .

c. RESTRICTIONS

mM

Operating Officials are responsible for monitoring all personnel acquired
through these procedures. They will ensure that such personnel are prop-
erly briefed and thoroughly understand any Umitations on their access to
Agency information and buildings and other pertinent security restrictions.

"| Operating Officials are required to advise appropriate offices at any time
- the relationship or use of such individuals is subject to a change. which

affects the terms of their contractual arrangements, their status, or se-

curity clearances.

Technical representatives and other types of personnel engaged under
procurement contracts or other agreements which do not create a direct

- employer-employee relationship are prohibited by law from holding formal
organizational positions or positions requiring the exercise of any admin- .

istrative authority. They are also prohibited from’ formally representing

RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE OF CERTAIN
CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS

~ Rescission: CSI 50-10, 13 July 1970

GENERAL ~

a. Elemental in the conduct of clandestine operations is the use of human
agents to accomplish the missions of the Operations Directorate. In gen-
eral, it is DDO policy to select agent assets with primary regard to the
agents’ abilities, target access, and security, and with few restrictions as
to their origins, professions or status as members of particular groups. The
basic rule is that any consenting adult may be used by the Operations

'- Directorate. There. are, however, certain sensitive categories of individuals
_ or groups whose operational use by the Operations Directorate is prohibited
‘ or.in some way. restricted for reasons not necessarily related to security
considerations.

_ b. These prohibitions or restrictions stem from one of the following:

2.

(1) The Agency has been directed by .U.S. Governmental authority to
restrict or avoid the operational use of a particular category, of in-
‘dividuals. .

(2) The Agency has entered into a special restrictive agreement: with an
organization, government, corporation, or official responsible for a
category of individuals. __

_ (3) The: Director or the Deputy Director for Operations ' has imposed
restrictions on the operational use of a certain category ‘of individuals
due to the extreme risk or sensitivity of such exploitation.

PURPOSE |

The purpose of this instruction is ‘to set forth the prohibitions and’ policy
restrictions (as distinguished from security restrictions) which currently per-'
tain to the operational use of various categories of individuals, together with
the special approval procedures to be followed in certain cases. Where ap-’
propriate, reference has been. made to another publication which provides
more detailed guidance than has been attempted in this instruction. The

. special approval procedures set. forth in this instruction do not: supersede or

alter in any way the requirements for covert approvals contained in DOI
and DOLF 10-5. /ottache a)! ;

3. DEFINITIONS

- Within the context of this instruction, the definitions listed below will apply.
Special note must be taken of the fact that the key term “operational use”
employed throughout this instruction has been defined in the. most succinct
manner consistent with clarity. It has not been feasible, however, to cover in
a definition the entire scope of possible variations in operational circumstances
which may be encountered in DDO activities. The definition of “operational

use” is intended to provide guidance for the majority of cases, and must be.

. employed with responsible operational judgment. Issues involving a deter-

. mination of “operational use” which cannot be resolved with reasonable as-

-surance by the. responsible operating comporents will be referred to the
_ Deputy Director for Operations for decision. -

a. Operational Use

‘the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, or his designee, will, if the Office of
Security does not recommend against the use of the individual, determine
whether an Operational Approval should be granted and will notify the Of-
fice of Security.of its decision. However, in the event the Office of Secu-
rity recommends against the use of an individual and the Clandestine
Services still desires, on a calculated risk basis, to use the individual, |

. the Counter Intelligence Staff will inform the Office of Security of this
(i ra fact. In this event, the Counter Intelligence Staff and the Security Support
\ _ Division will endeavor to arrive at an agreed position and, to this end,
the former will hold the granting of the Operational Approval in abeyance
until five days have elapsed after the Office of Security has been advised
of this intention. The Counter Intelligence Staff will notify the Office of
C : , Security whenever it has:

oe : _(1) Granted an Operational Approval or a Provisional Operational Approval.
(2) Cancelled an Operational Approval.

e. In Operational Approval cases the Office of Security will forward investi-
gative reports, name check results, etc., to the Counter Intelligence Staff.
In extremely sensitive cases, however, particularly those in which the
a, : . security or good of the Agency as a whole is involved, the Office of Secu-
ran : rity will not be obliged to furnish all investigative material: In such cases
hee : 0 the Office of Security will inform the Counter Intelligence Staff that such
: : material has been withheld and will, upon request, discuss the matter with
L ; the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, or other appropriate official of the
Clandestine Services. ;

mo, f. A Provisional Operational Approval may also be requested where circum- a
: stances warrant. A search of the indices of the Agency, including those |

: of the Office of Security, is a minimum requirement for issuance of a Pro- _

cee ; __. Visional Operational Approval. .

g- Whenever interest in an individual under consideration for either an Oper-
ational Approval or a Provisional Operational Approval is terminated for
any reason, the requester, in order to.prevent needless processing, will
notify the Counter Intelligence Staff promptly so that the latter may in turn
advise the Office of Security.

—«ée COVERT SECURITY APPROVALS AND PROPRIETARY APPROVALS

a. All background material will be assembled by the interested divisions and
will include any biographic data; information of an investigative or secu-
rity significance; information-relating to character, reputation, politics,
past employment, residences, and other activities; favorable and unfavor-
able information; PRQ Part I or its equivalent (in duplicate); and field
traces. This material is forwarded-directly to the Office of Security in
its original form. (Traces need not be obtained from the Records Inte-
gration Division; see paragraph 5.b., below.) A brief practical statement
of the scope, nature, and geographical area of use of the subject will also

to the Office of Security any suggestions regarding the investigation to be
conducted and any particular points to be emphasized in the investigation,
such as, special skills, abilities, and weaknesses of the subject. The re-
quester should also indicate what would be the most plausible type of cover
(i. e., Government or commercial) to be employed in the conduct of the
investigation and whether the subject has been briefed as to the fact of a
pending investigation and, if not, why this.is not feasible.

b. In Covert Security Approval or Proprietary Approval cases, the files of the

/ Records Integration Division will be searched by representatives of the
Office of Security. All files of the Records Integration Division, except
those portions containing specific sensitive operational data, will be made
available to the representatives of the Office of Security. In those in-
stances where a document of interest contains sensitive operational data,
designated professional personnel within the operating division will re-
view that portion of the information and furnish therefrom to the repre- .
sentatives of the Office of Security all information of the nature described
in paragraph 5.a., above. The:Office of Security will conduct appropriate
investigation in each case and will issue or deny Covert Security Approvals
and Proprietary Approvals, and Provisional Covert Security Approvals and
Provisional Proprietary Approvals.

©, The Office of Security will retain the investigative files in Covert Security

Approval cases or Proprietary Approval cases, but will:

(1). Make available to the Counter Intelligence Staff any significant infor-
‘ mation in cases where Covert Security Approvals or Proprietary Ap-
Provals are granted.

(2) Immediately call to the attention of the Counter Intelligence Staff any
new evidence in Covert Security Approval or Proprietary Approval -
cases that reflects the subject’s connection with a foreign government,
the Communist Party, or any front-organization of the Communist .
Party.

d: Where the Office of Security issues or denies a Covert Security Approval
or a Proprietary Approval, formal notification will be directed to the re-
quester. In the case of disapproval one copy of the security disapproval

'. will be forwarded to the Counter Intelligence Staff. Where a Covert Se-

curity Approval or Proprietary Approval is denied and the Clandestine
Services still desires-to use the subject on a calculated risk basis, the Of-
fice of Security will; upon request, furnish to the Counter Intelligence Staff a
Summary of the investigative data. Thereafter, the Counter Intelligence

Staff, the requester, and the Security Support. Division will attempt to reach -

an agreéd position.

-e. A Covert Security Approval or a Proprietary Approval may be preceded

by a Provisional Covert Security Approval or a Provisional Proprietary
Approval.
