1. Forwarded herewith is a contact ‘report freer PACHANKIS on his follow-up

interview of Alexander SANKO (201-866054), which concerns SAMKO"s contact with

AMAUTO/1 (201-735296)" in Madrid. As can be seen frea the report, Madrid Station's
defensive briefing of SAMKO apparently took effect and he has been ¢autious in

avoiding the many suspicious characters that have appeared since his trip to
i a

Madrtd. 4
2. The question. of his writing to AMAINID/T was aentioned by SAMNO. He was
told that AMAUTO/1 was back in Cuba and we did ant know when he would return to
Madrid, if evers Miamt belfeves we should waite until AMALTU/} retums to
Madrid, or seme other post tn tha Free World, and then havea SAMMO write to him.

3, Despite SYKO0's nowly self-discevered Inmes Bond talents PACHANKIS
enjoyed handling him. It also appears that our prisary objective, contact with
AMAUTU/L for a face to face assegsmeut, has been met.

Contact Report on Alexander SAMKO, on 28 July 2970,

1. On the morning of 28 Suly, Zt called Sam to check in-with hin. °°

after. being away on’ TSY for
.bpset at not being contacted during this period, so I dashed

almost 6 weeks, -He sounded a bit

him at ease,

2. it was plain. to see that the trip had changed him. He is now
: a bit presumptuous, cocky, and know it all James Sond. He told
me all sorts of wild stories about being tailed in. Madrid “by

7 or’ 8 .'Chivatos' (Castro agents," and leading them on long

"8 or 9 mile hikes through Madrid,” Castro agents were, also
“yatching" him on the day

he-was in Barcelona and on the short
layover his Pan Am plane had in Lisbon on his way home. at no
time, however, was he molested by these "agents,"

-so San says— in Hollywood.
"About the second night after I got home," ¢c. 14-15 June, a car
parked across the street and a little to the rear of his house
"after it got dark." When Sam got into his car and went ‘to the
gas station, the car -described as looking like a white Volxswagen,
without headlights on= followed Sam's car on his short trip in :
the neighborhood and back to -his home. He could not make out
the physical description of the driver of the VW. He has~never~

seen this car again.

:

} 4. ‘The only other suspicious individual near his home, was "a tall,

F . thin man," (described as-about 5-11 to 6 ££ and 170 lbs; black

B . hair; no distinguishing features visible; once wearing slacxs and
> .waite shirt, another tine wearing a suit). This individual showed

ie up across the street from his home "just as the sua had gone cown,

4 Several evenings during the first wees that 2 got home.” (ce. 1li-18

; Sune) The man just walxed past the front back ard forth a faw tin

. and appeared to have his car around ‘the cornes of Sam's house.

: could not identify the ear or anything else about the mane

} . S. “Again, during the first week after his return San received several
telepshone calls where no one would answer when the phone was picked
up, or the person calling would say, "sorry, wrong number." San
has not experienced any other suspicicus incidents after

week home from Spain. i should note that Saa Soes not ta

x
: these incidents with fear, but ratheriin the vein of a paperback
detective story. : .
i Gs. Sam would not admit that he enjoyed himsel£ soméwhat in Madrid as
. a tourist, although he did not deny that he stayed in a luxury hotel,
ate as‘well as drank. well, saw the sites and even went to a night
club, ail on the house, He went so far as to say that if he had
“xnown'it was going to be like this, I never would have gone." Yes,
in the-same breath, he told "iliiam" that he would be back in
Spain in September, Of Souesey Sam would go again if we asked hin, .

“Nilliam" dsXed him to.send him some photos of Cape’ Kennedy. .

motos of che Cape‘ that he can send. Sam states he will

ng we wish I promised to check out the status of the

Case with my office and Madrid to see what course of action they

Ceen should be initiated; : Ao

Modesty ‘not being one of his greatest virtues Sam rambled and

Tabled about ‘the. "secrats" he’ got out of "illiam" and passed

‘en-to the Madrid c/o. I went along with him and complimented him

‘done; which is-true. But, he was not satisfied with
hat Washington, said?" To which I
fami thought you did an
excellent! job and we are. most grateful for your cooperation.” - He
ikea that very much; you could see it in the smile on his face,
He tries to make it sound like it was a great ordeal and sacrifice
on his part to-go to Spain to see "Willian," but he; cannot hide:

-On a job wel

“his anxiety to get on. the next plane to Madrid, and the good life there,

I pointed out that "Nilliam™ is now back in Cuba and there is no

ineication of when he will return’ . Nevertheless, Sam feels he

should write him "because the letter will be sent to Cuba to him."

Zt assured him that I would get a reading on this matter and have

an answer for him sonetine Rext week, At that time, I promised. to
take him and his Close friend Masip to lunch. - Sam gave me an | Lt
extensive and expensive expense aécount oF his trips” “I will’ attempt
to: decipher it at the close of this report, . .

We ended the meeting on very cordial terms. He was not so mad at
not being contacted so much as he is dying to Get back on’ the gravy
train, and so much time has passed by without word to or from
"William." Sam asked Tor some way in which he can contact us
“right away” if "Willian" notifies him "that he's ready to juns
You know when he junss won't have much time." pointed cut
that af present ewillian” is in Cuba and the prosnects of hin
deflecting from. Cuba right-now are very slin indeed, We would, however,
take this into considgeration after “dilliam" retucns to Spain or

another foreign post. We will be seeing each other next week to

clear up the accounting (we owe him money, he says) and have lunch.

“2. On ‘the evening.

--@t an out-door restaurant. t
rehearsing his cover Story, reviewing the objective:
trying to anticipate questions. AMNAUTO-1 might ask: dui

“their meeting together SAMKO was given” ith

‘foremost objective

relationship ‘that: ex:
from the. United States,

be, To’ ‘exchange addresses and telephone
numbers for the purpose of sending occasional, .
“greetings to one another. : ae
. .€, TO, invite: AMAUTO-1 (and his wife, if
- necessary) to dinner, at his expense.

d. To ascertain AMAUTO-1's, future ‘plans.

. e. To assess AVAYTO-1's feelings toward
the United States and toward his own government, |

f. For SAMKO to talk favorably about the
United States using himself as an example, (the
son of ‘immigrant parents who made good in business);
to emphasize the opportunities available to anyone
with imagination, ambition and aggressiveness.

&. If the opportunity presented itself,
ate . to show sympathy for the apparent failure of the
“Cuban Government to reach the 10 million ton
Sugar goal and to ask whether the non-fulfillment
of this goal would adversely affect the economic
development of Cuba. It was our hope that some-
time during the conversation AMAUTO-1 would
volunteer to discuss his country's economic .
situation which might have opened the conversation
to further exploitation by SAMKO. -

h, Paralle) with objective e. above, SAMKO
was instructed to ask (provided an appropriate opening
appeared in the conversation) AMAUTO-1 for his
personal comments on the Vietnam issue and anti-war
demonstrations in the United States and abroad, We
were trying to draw out AMAUTO-1's personal analysis
‘of the U.S. position vis-a-vis the war in Vietnam
and to compare his stateménts withthe Cuban Government
position . oe ; . ; . -

3. Although, SAMKO was determined to see AMAUTO-1 even
if he had to camp outside AMAULTO-1's home, we reminded him
that because of ANAUTO-l's position, he might refuse to see
SAMKO in his home, but that SAMKO should not hesitate to

The maid said’ he wasn't in. He explained to
the maid that it was "very importante” to
see the Senor, By this time another maid
“appeared,.shown in this photo, and she gets
“into the act. She repeats that el Senor is
not in. SAMKO, sensing he wasn't getting
anywhere, changed his tactics and asked to
-- see "la Senora", The maids went into indivi-
dual monologues, but SAMKO could not understand
what they were saying. Finally, SAMKO produced
“a note, which’-he was asked to prepare, and
‘handed it. to the maid in this photo. SAMKO
“repeated that it was "very importante to see_

park located at the Casa del Campo. ) : ,

4. During the conversation in AMAUTO-1's home, SAMKO
began his deliberate. softening of AMAUTO-1 with such comments
as “you know Bill, Julio was Jealous of. you because I treated
you like a brother: J didn't-want you to return to Cuba, but
I couldn't Stop you. We were'all in favor of Castro." Bill
admitted here that SAMKO was a good friend and enjoyed his job
and the pay was good, but added that "I had to go. 1 was in
the States illegally." " SAiKo- added "you.know, Bill, I never
was blessed with any children; you were like a son to me, but
when I heard you died in the mountains in Cuba, I blamed myself
for letting you go." Bill replied that he was wounded on his
left side.- SAMKO explained that if AMAUTO-1 was in the States
illegally, SAMKO could have arranged for him to remain in. the
States by getting assistance from some police and detective
‘friends in’Florida., SAMKO repéated his delight to again see
AMAUTO-1 and tow happy he was to know he is alive,

5. Moments .after entering the howe, AMAUTO-1 invited
him to have breakfast. ‘SAMKO refused, but settled for a beer.

business interests, but -if you were there with me, Bill, you
“could have handled my affairs and you might have been a
millionaire today." SAMKO sensed that AMAUTO-1 and his wife-
“were moved by this comment and were literally drooling with
the thought of being millionaires, The wife asked a number

of questions regarding SAMKO's wealth, his real estate activity,
collection of silver and his success in general, The wife
was astounded with the Simple explanation of how SAMKO went
about building and financing apartment houses. SAMKO made :
a Suggestion that AMAUTO-1 invest in silver because the scarcity .
of this metal would eventually raise the market value. He

explained to AMAUTO-1 that he was collecting all silver coins

stamped prior to 1965. The next couple of hours were spent

at the amusement park where, on arrival, AMAUTO-1 steered

SAMKO to a cafeteria near. the main entrance. In short order

two men arrived on .the scene, friends of AMAUTO-1. They were
introduced to SAMKO, but’ SAMKO could ‘not remember the names,
: After a few moments a couple arrived and they, too, were

introduced to S!MKO. (SAMKO could not identify the persons

he met from the. Photographs in our mug book.). AMAUTO-1's

friends took a number of photographs of SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 and

after a short while together, they left. The conversation at

the park'was aimless.’ They discussed the kids and SAMKO repeated

how delighted and Proud he was to know that one of AMAUTO-1'S :
children was named. Alexander - his namesake, AMAUTO-1 had

.& wide grin while SAMKO was talking’ about Alexander. He asked
AMAUTO-1 about the oldest boy. AMAUTO-1 replied that the oldest

was in Havana Studying civil enginecring. SAMKO suggested to
ANAUTO-1 that he Should give his children the best education and

have them stay away from politics and political courses but
concentrate on the professional fields, engineering, law,

medicine, etc, AMAUTO-1 admitted that his intention was to

keep. his children away from a political career, SAMKO said he

would send Alexander some commercial slides of Cape Kennedy

and other points of interest in Florida.

it was his private "pad". His comment was:"you sure live it up
well." As PACHANKIS aptly explained in one of his reports,
SAMKO's ‘temper does rise. He was highly excited during the
meeting because he was asked to leave the hotel room, Since

- the reservation was made for four days, he was asked to leave.

He pleaded with SACODER to do something to keep him in the hotel
room or risk losing the opportunity to lunch with AMAUTO-1
because AMAUTO-1 was to call him at the hotel on Saturday,

6 June. SACODER admitted the error but added that there was

a simple solution if he could not convince the hotel manage-
ment to allow him to stay a few more days. SACODER suggested
that he should explain to the manager that 1) his laundry had
not yet returned and 2) he was expecting an important phone
call on Saturday and that there was no way of vetting in touch
with the caller, . Failing this, SACODER offered another simple
solution. Since SAMKO and AMAUTO-1 had not yet exchanged
addresses, SAMKO could return to the AMAUTO-1 home and give

the maid a note advising AMAUTO-1 that he had to change hotels,
(SAMKO admitted that he told AMAUTO-1 about the possibility of ©
having to leave the hotel because his reservation ended soon.)
SAMKO did not at first accept this logic, but SACODER explained

“that he (SACODER) could not plead with the hotel management

on..SAMKO'S behalf. ‘This was poor security. SAMKO accepted ;
this and after a glass of scotch and water admitted that the
solution was indeed simple, but he was terribly excited at first,

9. Throughout the debriefing SAMKO revealed the following:
He was born in Pertin Amboy, New Jersey on 2 November 1907 to
Polish parents. At the age of 14-15 he worked-as a construction
hand on a ‘bridge being built in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania.
Later, he worked on the construction of the Anhauser Yeast
Factory in Oldbridge, New Jersey. He married in 1930. During
the hard years, his wife worked in a factory while he roamed
the streets looking for employment. In the early 40's he
worked for Dupont reportedly on the atomic bomb project, but
specifically with U-235. Aftér the war he applied for work

should not attempt to get in touch with PACHANKIS. He under-

- oT 1 - On the moriiing of: 6 June AMA UT -i's- wife. called oa
“SAMIKO and, in English, said-that h husband would pick him

up -at.. 1400- hours--in- front of tle hott th ippointed

hour, AMAUTO-1's .official- vehicle pulled up an “front ‘of- the
- hotel driven by a chauffeur. AMAUTO-1 ‘greeted SAMKO in front

of the hotel and after exchanging a few words, ‘they departed
for a nearby restaurant, (SAMKO was too preoccupied to make
-* note of the name of the restaurant. We decided against any

*“surveillance during “he AMAUTO-1/SAMKO meeting to avoid alerting
‘AAMAUTO-1 and/or his staff that the SAMKO visit to Madrid

was pre-planned, on

SES. at luneh “SANKO and J AMAUTO-1 ‘again reminisced.
They | discussed. the following: ;

vA. In one of his references, ‘AMAUTO-1 said
| that, men like him are needed - in Cuba and
‘noted. that ae would probably die fighting
for Cuba which is young and aggressive, .
but-that some day it will be a great .
‘country, that. he has been. fighting ‘all.
-his life’ to relieve the oppressed and
* yepeated that he will die fighting.
(it is interesting to note SAMNKO's reaction
cheré to AMAUTO-1's statement. When SAMKO -
first visited AMAUTO-1 on 31 May, he was
certain that under the facade of being a
devoted revolutionary AMAUTO-1 was indeed a
capitalist at heart, but at this meeting
SAMKO modified his comment by adding that
it appears AMAUTO-1 is truly a communist,
who maintains strong convictions of the
righteousness of the revolution. The above
comments by AMAUTO-1 produced’ the peg. on
which SAMKO could have questioned the veracity
of AMAUTO-1's statement on freeing the
oppressed, but he was' not specifically
7 - instructed to maintain a polemic argument
~ "on the rights and wrongs of the revolution
‘- because we felt this objective was secondary
to the re-establishment of a relationship
between these two old friends, A future
meeting might include the exchange of*an
- objective appraisal of the revolution as

seen by: SAMKO.)

B. AMAUTO-1 proposed that SAMKO act as an
intermediary for the sale of Cuban sea food
in the United States. He explained that
tthe Cubans have a large fishing fleet in

i . the Canary Islands. The fish caught is

nn precessed in the Canary Islands and can be

. . shipped to the United States as a product

. of Spain, not of Cuba. AMAUTO-1 added,
"SAMKO, you're like a father to me, please
think about it (the agency}? AMAUTO-1
explained that SAMKO could earn about $200,000
a-year in commission based on sales of
$2,000,000. SAMKO said he would think about
it, but privately to SACODER he said that
he had no‘intention to disturb his’ retirement
with a fishy business,

-E. SAMKO ‘restated that "Bill, you have a:

'. Théy’ exchanged addresses. SAMKO had
printed his address, but AMAUTO-1 asked
him'to write it on another piece of
paper. AMAUTO-1 reasoned that he wanted
“it written to understand it better, but we
believe! he will use the sample to compare
it with letters SAMKO might send in the -

* future... They promised to write to each

other. SAMKO was given AMAUTO-1's private

address, not that of the embassy, .

G. AMAUTO-1 regretted that SAMKO had to
leave so. soon because he would have
enjoyed showing SAMKO the Spanish
interior, SAMKO said he might consider
returning near the end of 1970, but
AMAUTO-1 did not ‘say whether he would
be in Spain in late 1970,

H. AMAUTO-1 said he was Suspicious when
he first saw SAMKO noting that the nature
-and importance of his position make him
act suspicious, but the Suspicion soon
dissipated - so he said,

“14. On Saying their last goodbyes at the hotel, both
men embraced and again promised to keep in touch through
correspondence, At this point the Operation was over. SAMKO
-WaS met late that evening. He was taken to a new safehouse,.

15, Accomplishments: We feel the objectives programmed
and rehearsed were Successfully fulfilled, perhaps far greater
than our own expectations. Unless we are misjudging the shrewd—
ness of AMAUTO-1 through our own naivete, we believe the ,
relationship was Sincerely re-established and a channel opened
for future use by AMAUTO-1 Should he desire to use this channel
other than to maintain a friendly correspondence, It was un~

fortunate that his Barcelona trip interfered possibly to the
point of SAMKO having one or two additional meetings with AMAUTO-1
nonetheless, in the six plus hours together, SAMKO admirably
fulfilled our requirements and courageously maintained the
fiction of his visit to Spain. We believe too, that although
AMAUTO-1 appears to be solidly in favor of the Cuban regime,
he did not criticize the United. States which we feel he might.
have done had he Suspected that SAMKO's visit to Madrid was

: Holland, where they will spend a week, ard they want a visa.

that is going to Holland and the other countries). Ruiz asks
her if 1¢ is her first trip to furope. She says it is her first
trip to Western Europo, but that she has alroady been in the
socialist countries of Europe. Ruiz asks them what Havana thought
about De la Nuez. ‘Rutz says it isn't worth hav'nr an aprument -
or quarrel with the "galleco" because of _De la Nunez, Ruiz . D
believes that the whole af"alr was handled by “he C.T. A.

Ruiz asks them who has «eon raned ambassavor to Morocco, and “hey
confirm the fact that the husband of his dauchter (CHAIN-?) has
been apnointed. .

BAHREDA, who have loen called from Havana by telephone. The
tickets: are to be reserved, for the two of then only, not for
the wives, neither. Mercedes nor Nilda. foe
‘.Ruig says ‘that (ETRA isto arrive today on his way. to Paris,
‘and they will See what he has to say about. this(the call from
_.Havana) They don't. know 1f the call from Vavana is for the -

two of them to discus metitng related to Snain. Pacheco
“gays that that is may hy the ambassador of Helsinki asked

for reservations yesterday

: et Ruiz continues to talk with the new person that has arrived. \ q :
\- He says that he has had to mo to the Hotel “Conde Duque to . y

visit the crew of Cubana, who have never once come to the coy

ue
oot go ,
‘ wy! Ther havee complained about Ruiz because sonétines they have \
pr* learned of receptions that have taken place and they ‘haven't ‘
been invited, Ruiz.says that if at these receptions they invited :.
industrial and commercial people, or even enltural people, they ;
would get nothing done here. when they give a reception it is i
because of work, to raintain contacts, find things out, and not ‘
for any other purposo. They have nothine to do there, and he
is not zoing to invite them to just come and eat and-drink . :
When they have to spend some pesetas they do it, but for questinans
of vork. Nevertheloss they havo the obliration to maintain i
o contacts, Ruiz has sometim:s mot these people on the stroet,
il espectally the air-stewardesses, with some “otekeup", and althourh!}
‘all the people they are friendly with are very nice peorle, :
they should know who thee people are. i

A\erbassy, althourh sometimes’ sone of then aré here for a weok3.-
they don't attend the study circles, the reetines, nor anything. ;

Ruiz then explains to this new comrade the problem of the location
of the embassy. He tel’ him that they are building a now embassy
and all the services will be together. There will also be some
community rooms, such a5 a library, a recreation rcom, A dining
room with a bar, that they will all have a chance to seo, but
-tnis is going to take probably a year. It will be on Avonida

de la Havana, Meanwhile they arc putting un with this place
pecause they only ney $50,00 for it, and Havana finds its a rift.
If they were paying.S500, by now they wonlintt be here; they -
would have found some other place. Ther have the place rented
since 1936, and even thourh they have spent more than a thousand
(or one hundred thousand) in fixing it, it is still an old house.

With this new arrival he talks about the children, and the problems .
they have with the schools. They nave to find scheols where
_they don't teach relipinn nor politics.
Revort 10.350 (continued) - "2h June 1970.

It seoms that they would lfke to brine @ nrofessor fron Havana,
a. . _,80 that the children could study. the same revolutionary. rethods -
. toe as there, but Ruiz se6s this as a very aifficult thing to do,
: . Becauso,one would not solve the Situation of the different
- Brades and anres,:and they.are not foin ‘to send four or five
because they are needed there. — He sees it as a better possibil-
ity=to hire Spanish proféssors among the younr canable people,
with revolutionary leanings and who are sinpathetic toward | oe
Cubans, and. have them teach the methods,and from books that are
brought from there, In this way they could have many professors
_. or teachers for the various aves, and they conld rent and
. furnish an apartment for this purpose, : _o ”

- Apparently “uiz has no problems’ So : .

is a friend of theirs and <isits the embassy, Her husand {3.a i
communist, The children that attend the school have the game volitical
leanings as their parents, Notther relirion nor politics are :
taught. Ruiz says that the two older ones eat at the sc-onl, but
the little ones don't as they. need help, Rutz pays ovar *100 for bet
The person who is with him has two children and pays $100 for the .

two.

. The'children of this new comrade that !e. talking to Ruiz arrive
day after tomorrow, He has a little cirl 11 years old and the
other one 1s nine. Rutz is advising the com-ade to srnd hi-
children to the samo school where his children po. The nane
ve of the school is "ESPINO" or ""L PIO", in thé Calle Serrano,

‘“¥ He says he will be flad to speak to the Director, they havo
sports, and music, and tho children can havo lunch at the school,

i . Report No.351 . 25 June 1970

He is talking with Mercedes, and they enter the office and
continue the conversation, They are speaking in confidential
voices, because Mercedes normally talks very loud, they are .
now talking in very ‘low voices. Mercodes is trying to consale
hin, sayin; that his work is very difficult and little under-
stood, Ruiz says that they are"throwing him the bait,"

He is very dopressed,

Tomorrow he has an anpotntnent vith Quiroga publishing comnany,

wh» have had a meeting with DAVID. PAX(phon) about the rishts

of the son: "Cuantanamera.", which was acknowleded in London

by an American firm, ‘and it's author as being the Cuban

this amount will have to he divided ancng many thinrs, something —
would fall to then, . . .

Ruiz.-says to-work abroad they have to'or should send people of —
the greatest trust, otherwise it ts better t hat they remain in -
Cuba. If there isn't-coriplete confidence it is a constant

ugsle with the capitalistic life, money, the stores, the easy

Gone, ‘but the interesting thing woald be to know what motivated

“himg ‘his wife, his’ son, or money. He says that it has caused

a.creat impression here, and that no one aven imarined such a . \
thing. Only two days before he had been in the study circle : :
with all of them, mo, . :

A gird that is in this noeting with Rutz says that. De la Nuez! —

says that thoy will now have to reconsider t-1s), and what they :

Ruiz mentions the letter from De la Muez* son in witch ho says that
his father has betrayed them, They also mention an ambassador
who ‘has left(for Cuba-?) and took watches as sifts to everyone
in the Ministry, Ruiz thinks that some of them will. remain here ot

“tn Spain as they have a groat deal polnr for them there.

Renort No.352 : “26 June 1970

Ruiz! is very displeased, He speaks to Horacio about how badly
some oF the comrades speak of him when they return to Havana,

“ He asks him if he rerembers the name of one of these comrades

that spoke badly of him last summer when he was there on vaca-
tion. It was someone named COLON and another one that soon left,
After what COLON said they wrote hima letter calling his atten-
tion to the c#iticism, Ruiz is very worried about hia re-call
to Havana, le tolls RoraéYo that tie doesn't think {6 fs about
hfs work, and Horacio says they are doing thinss there ‘th at are
super-human, that without the necessary means at hand they are
resolving difficult problem of various kinds. Ruiz mentions
contacts.that he has had in Spain with different people, and he
never has cormitted an-error, and has always’ handled everything
with great tact and in favor of his governzent, even when he has
had to deal with Falanzists.

Ruiz says that ho is very s-nsitive and that things have pot to
the point that he can't just let them ro by, thines they are |
accusing him of in Havana, Rut, there is no one that has the
colirage to tell him directly to his face so that he could

justify hins:1f, and if they are things that he cannot handle then
for them to call him back, and relieve him of the post because

"Corr andante Guillermo Ruiz cannot resolve then, but the thing ts

into doing his job. 0° *. Tet oo

Ruiz says that one nevér knows about these th*ngs in Havana,
.and that it is possible that he won't be returning.:. In the
event that this should hapoen, he is goinr to leave Horacio
officially in charge, so that he will represent him durtas
his abscence.as Charge’de Affairs, and if he returns he will
notify the Spanish government officially. He wants gorples.
or models of the passports to take with him, and then he
tells Horacio that if he has not returned by the 18th of -
July, that he should represent hin at the official recestion.
He gives Horacio instructiens as to what to wear, what the
official coremontes are and just what they consist of,

Until now, we have not been able to identify cither Subject
or her relationship with RUIZ.

2. On 28 May QUDOZE (a sensitive joint audio penetration
with liaison) reported the following memorandum (presumably
to Havana) on Subject as dictated by RUIZ:

"Sr. RUIZ Ojeda, Some months ago we received
a ciphered cable dealing with Aiaa Rosa CORREA Felipe
asking that we contact her to determine her situation.
At that time we informed you that said Aida Rosa CORREA,
married to Pedro ECHEVARRIA_, Portuguese
citizen who was in Cuba during 1959-1968, intended
to return to our country, abandoning her husband
because of his alcoholism,

“who has worked in our country - we saw no :
‘difficulty. to’ prevent her from Yeturning, especially
taking into account the fact that she expressed ,
herself as a revolutionary, ‘but that first we

‘ , he has been since late 1967 as Cuban Charge ¢* affairos.
(It was reported that on 27 July 1968, he arkived in Paris,
from Madrid. We donot know the reasons for that trip).

Access: a. Rolando CARDOSO Perez (Al8.239 674). ‘Arrived in the
: U.S. on 10 October 1968 from Madrid, Spain. Ke knows oe
Subject because he and Subject are cousins (Subject's
mother and Rolando's mother are sisters). When Rolan=
do arrived in the U.S., he said he was going to re~
_side at 940 sw llth Avenue, Miami, Florida, talephona
number 377~3877. We have not been able to locate him
because we were told at this address that Rolando had
. _left for another state and that his Present address
‘ was-unknown to them). Rolando saw Subject for the last
time at the Rarajas Airport, Madrid, Spain, on 10 Oc-
_ tober 1968, when Rolando was going to take the plane
‘hich brought him to the u.s. _ According to Rolando,
they greeted each other on that occasion. Rolando
said he had seen Subject at this same airport in early. .
or mid-1968 and that they had talked for approximately
five minutes. On this opportunity, Subject was at the
airport waiting for the arrival of a group of Cuban
‘ diplomats. .

b. Manuel Domingo Garman VIGOS Perez (A18 780 716). Ar=-
xived in the U.S. on.20 February 1970 by way of tha
Refugee Airlift. Ha knows Subject because he and Sub-
ject are cousins (Subject's mother. and Manuel's mother
are sisters). Manuel saw Subject for the last time
in 1963, at the home of Subject's mother, where thoy
happened to meet. According to Manuel, he and Subject
only said hello to each other. When Manuel arrived

in the U.S:, he reported his address as £000 NV Fourth.
Street, Miani, Florida, tolephone nimber 445-7193, home
of a lady nahod Mercades BORGES Dobarrogs. -Manucl also
stated that he wold later leave for 423 Wast 49th
5, Street, Now York, N-¥., hono of Antonio GOMEZ Lemus.
-'Manuel told”: 2 that he and his friend, Jorga BORGES
Dobarros, were’ homosexuals and had bean living together ©
since. approxinately - 1963. (Jorge BORGES Dobarros ar=
rived in Miani- aboard the: same Rafugee Airlift flight.-
‘ag -Manuél, Ha is-a brother of Mercedes BORGES Dobarros,
.,and'he and Manuel went to liva in Mercedes' house when
they arrived in Miami). : .

ve that Manuel cannot be used in an approach
© Subject because they have not maintained. relations
_.f0r a long period of years. In addition, Subject night
‘know Manuel! waakness’ (homogexualism) “and might taka
_ advantage of this. knowledge to blackmail Manuel. Ma-
“nuel also. told I-122 that he had received psychiatrie
treatment in Havana. :

-. Assesaments Subject's present position; the positions, all of thom
. important ,which he has held before; and the fact that
he has been reported as a DGI officer, lead us to be-
lieve that wo do not have many possibilities of success
din-an attempt to recruit or defact Subject. Tho fact
. that Subject's fathor has been a militant Comaunist
since prior to 1959 and that Subject's wife has been
reported as a supporter. of tha xogine should not be

forgotten,

Subject‘s revolutionary background during the struggle
against BATISTA seems to indicate that he is in favor
‘of acts of terrorism. This gave hin knowledga and ex=
porience in matters related to subversive activities
and/or intelligence activities which ha could use later,

Therefore, we believa that orastes Guillermo RUIZ Pa-~
rez must be a very useful person for tha Cuban regime,
in Spain. Ha-has experience in negotiating trade agree-
ments and in handling administrative affairs (he has
beon working in this field for more than ten years).

All this knowledgé and experiance added to his know=
ledge and oxperience in subversive and intelligence
affairs make him a man who is not oftan found inthe 4.
Castro regime. : .
