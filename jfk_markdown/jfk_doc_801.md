(Suor appreciated the KGB document forwarded with
Reference and have submitted the following comments and
questions: : .

1. "We have a number of questions about this document
on which we should be grateful for your comments, and aa
background to some of these we think it will be useful for
you tohave an account of QYNNE-ELLTS dealinga with AELADLE:

- ga,” “phey date from June 1961 when he was con-
sidering a visit to the U.S.3.R. He mentioned this to the
Soviet Ambastador, whom he-met at. the Queen's Brthday
Celebration in Helsinki, (he did not realize at first that

.. 4% was the Ambassador to whom he was talking). The Ambassador

“2° guggested that he should get in touch with Ivan Efimovioh
SEROEEV, an identified R.1.S. officer,

8

bd, “Between 5th and 15th July 1961 rnme-ELLIa)
went to the Consular Section of the Soviet Embassy to see
about the viea. Apparently he.did not see SERCFEV but met
AELADLE who showed a good deal of curiosity about him and
asked whether he had ever been to the U.S.3.R. before,
whether he had applied in London for a visa, what he was
doing in Helainki ete, The posaipility of ABLADLE taking
English lessons from{WYNNE-ELLIS)was mentioned and AELADLE
paid he would get in*touch wit SOeNNE-E IS ppout this. He
asked for a short biogrphy on WYNNE-ELLIS

: eo. “He brought the visa application forms and his
biography to AELADLE two days later and | ithough AELADLE was
. apparently very busy he seed WYNNE-ELLIS) for olarification

‘ of various details. AELADLE até not take English lesaons
fron (WYNNE-ELLIS )

a. at ‘t the end of September, or beginning of
Octobexs 1961, WYNNE-ELLIS )received a letter from AELADLE

ys Ming for the address of’his pen friend in Russia, Stanialav
rn” '  AQALKIN, who had been concerned in (WYNNE-ELLISY, recruitment

by the R.I.S (WYNNE-ELLIS telephoned AELADLE to say that

he did not have the new address. AELADLE told him that if
he wanted it, he could have a visa 'tomorrow! to visit
‘Stalingrad (now Volgograd) and.in.the ceurse of cenversats
-gaid ‘sometimes it is better to visit places but not old
friends!, We wondered at the time, and ever more after
AELADLE's defeotion, whether this remark had any special
eignificance. , :

e. “on 16th November AELADLE invited (WYNNE-ELLIS)
to attend a Soviet ooncert, AELADLE told him that he had
been granted a tourist visa but that if he wished to visit
his pen friend he would require a letter of invitation from
him. ARLADLE asked about Hs British trionds in Helsinki and
paid that he would phone @YNNE-ELLID next week to make a
further appointment, He Ad pot do this, ~

f. “A further development whict may be of interest
is that in early January 1952 (WYNNE-ELLIS) received a further
letter from his Kuesian pen frifend giving nim a fairly
preasing invitation to visit him.o6 @(YKKE~ ELLIS) who wags not |
aware of AELADLE'e defecticn, wrote to AELADLE telling him

that he had now receivea the invitation, and inviting hin
to coffee at hie house!

h 2, "We thought that the arrival of this letter (it 6
wae dated 25.12.61) so shortly after AELADLE's defection, 4
and after a long gap in the correspondence vetween( WYNN E~ELLIS)
and és 8 pen friend, might indicate that the R.I,S. suspected

NE=ELLI d had a hand in AELADLE's defection,
of, (WYNKESELLIS) was never aware that AELADLE wae an R.I.S. officer,

8 you know from an earlier convergation about
this de og YNNE-ELLIS)is a most unsatisfactory character

to dec) with, and we believe that the R.I.S, have found him

a (he hae’, unsatisfactory! We have no reason to suppose that

he has double-crossed us since he was. turned ) but we would
not exclude this as a possibility - or at ledat would not
exolude the possibility that he might have considered this.

; 4, “our questions on the(WYNNE-ELLIS) document aupplied
by AELADLE are as follows:

a. "What ie the manuscript word at the top of the
first page, and what ia its significance? -

b. “The two typed words, one immediately below
the manuscript word on page 1 and the other to the left, are
not legibie on our copy.

« “Ys there anv significance in the date llth
’ November being in inverted commas, thus "11"¢

ad. “We are puzzled by what at first sight appeared
to be a date, 22.XII.1961, in the heading immediate)yv above
the text on page 1. In fact the Roman numerals 'XIz? are

the cyrillic letter X77, but we do not understand their
meaning, Can .AELADLE. explain this?

e. "What is the name in which the document is
signed, and does AELADLE know the true identity of this person?

f.o"ye are a little surprised at the cyrillio trana-
diteration of WYNNE-ELLIS"s name. We should have expected the
KGB to have a system which vould enable them to get back to
the correct English spelling. Admittedly (WHNNE-ELLIS} 8 name
is an awkward one to deal with.

g. ."We should have expected thet ABLADEZ would hava
~pent a trace request to his Headquarters shortly after the
first meeting with (IYNNE-ELLIS) in July 1961. Yet the reply
was apparently sent~only on llth November, Can AELADLE
comment on this? %

5. "We do not wish to suggeet by these comments that
“WG BuBpSest that this dooument might be a forgery, but we
would be grateful for your confirmation that you do not
consider this a possibility,

We do not at this etage wieh to euggest détailed questions
except to remark that we co not know the rea) namee of any
of the R.I.S. officers who dealt with his - including the
man whom, it 1s stated in the AELADLE docusent, he et in
