Theory re MOSKALEV, Yuriy Ivanovich and

Unidentified Man

' That Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV might be identifiable with

the "unidentified man" going into and coming out of the Soviet

Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The "unidentified man"

was recently identified by SLIPSTREAM as a KGB type by name of

"Yuri" whom he knew in Moscow in 1964.

According to travel records MOSKALEV was in the

USSR in 1964. in the U.S. in October 1963 .

MOSKALEV functions officially as a Soviet scientist
and often attends international conferences. He

has been in contact with known GRU Soviet diplomat in

the U.S.

MOSKALEV bears a striking resemblance to composite of

"Saul" in book Appointment in Dallas who claims he was involved

in the assassination of President Kennedy. "Saul" claims:

he crossed border into U.S. illegally and was in
Dallas on 20 November.

That he hed been to Mexico City, had a contact in
Soviet Embassy there, in 1963, and that he knew the
identity of OSWALD because he (OSWALD) had been

fingered to him in Mexico City.
- that OSWALD was involved in the Kennedy assassination

plot, but that he, "Saul'', fired shots that killed

Kennedy.

- that two hours after the assassination he, "Saul",

was out of the U.S. That he used limp as a
disguise.
QUESTIONS

1. Could MOSKALEV be "Saul"?

2. Could MOSKALEV, therefore, be mystery man who
boarded plane in Mexico City for Havana on 22
November 1963?

3. Was assassination a Soviet comspiracy without
Cuban knowledge?

RECOMMENDATION

1. Can we obtain voice tape of MOSKALEV, since he
has delivered speeches at scientific conferences
in U.S. and abroad?

2. If so, could we arrange to have McDonald (unwittingly)

hear it, to see if he recognizes it as that of "Saul'

can we find ,hotc that PENKOVSKY identified of
MOSKALEVSKIY..

May I see PENKOVSKIY's 201 file for period 61-63?
Get photos and check dut MOISEEV and BABKOV.

Via CI Staff, find out if we can show photo to DERYABIN
and ROSTVOROFF?

Could MOSKALEV be Dept 13? Could OSWALD have met with

him in Mexico City clandestinely in 1963?

interesting aspect of meeting was conduct

USSR Academy of Sciences. His subject was
listed as "Uptake and Retention of
Plutonium in Man"; no abstract was
presented, When he spoke he changed the
title to "Problems of Kenetics of Uptake

paper presented nothing new and can be
described as elementary. He apparently
spoke no English.

IAEA Symposium, on Neutron Irradiation,
Brookhaven, Long Island, N.Y. Oct 63.
JMOSKALEV, one of the Soviet delegates,
was frequent commentator on other people's
work and made a practice of denigrating
their reports with respect to radiation
lethality.
Sources (3 U.S. scientists) were asked
if they thought MOSKALEV's objectives
were motivated from anything more than
genuine scientific position. They
responded, - "Who can say?" MOSKALEY,
both from papers he gave and his questions
and comments in discussion, indicated he
was very sharp, The paper he gave
presented no new data. His paper said
nothing specific.

MOSKALEV participated in Second Int'l
~ ‘ Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone

: Seeking Radio Nuclides, Sun Valley,
Idaho, arriving two days éarly. He
had travelled alone to Sun Valley and
apparently was able to use his knowledge
of English language to get along on his
own. However, he complained to Chairman
of conference that he did not know enough
English to read his paper which also
required condensation because it was too
long for the time allowed. A colleague
who had known MOSKALEV from previous meet—

N.B. ings said MOSKALEV's knowledge of English
improved greatly after a few drinks.
However, he did not drink at all during
this conference. He did mention that he
had written the English version of the
paper he presented himself. A respected
U.S. scientisi with nore exper %ence
than MOSKALEV said he frankly did not
believe MOSKALEV's findings. (Said this
in private.) MOSKALEV atzempted to
make propaganda of a report by a West
German. MOSKALEV left the conference a

N.B, little upset. He took copious notes on
all papers, which indicated he understood
what was going on. He also took many
pictures with a 35 mm camera. From questions
he asked in private, it was obvious he
understood English quite well. Considerable
time was spent in arvanging visit to a U.S.
lab. in route to his home, He took a
gaeecrent route, without telling anyone

of plans; and did not visit ‘ ‘the Tap,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible Identity of the "Unidentified Man”
Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963
REFERENCES: A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City
Station
B. Paperback Boo’ "Apvointment in Dallas"
C. Soft File, Headquarters Information on

"Unidentified Man"

1. Photographs of the unidentified man were taken by
our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going
into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in
Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas,
Texas on 22 November 1963. Although cropped copies have
appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of
the Warren Commission Report, and the book “Appointment in
Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beenr
identified.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General
Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of
the unidentifid man as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer, whom he met
in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course
there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish
speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cukan group,

about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with
14-0000

.

the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same bu: lding
in Moscow. Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve
it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB
officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the
West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member

that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.

‘ elandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). Yuri

was entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes
with the Cuban group.

3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an
individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description
of the unidentified man. This lead to an individual by the
name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Sovet, reportedly a Doctor
of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international
scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.
Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a
sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many
of the documents in his dossier are OO reports from U.S.
scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at
scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater
knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability
is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is
noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.
It is also noted that on . occasions he reportedly was not
qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference.

His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

Following are items of interest from selected documents in
MOSKALEV's CRS dossier:

a. In 1961 PENKOVSKY identified a photo (with no
name provided) as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEVSKIY,
Air Force Col.and GRU officer in the Information Directorate
of the GRU,

b. | In December 1963 the FBI reported ”

ec. In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a delegate to the
IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island,
New York. Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV
was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made
a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to
radiation lethality.

d. In October 1967 MOSKALEV participated in the Second
International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early. He

Although he complained about not Inowing much English, he
admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.
MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West

did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious
notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was
going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.
From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he new

arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route to
his home, he took a different route, without telling anyone

Fe
of his plans, and did not visit the lat.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of \
the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared
photos of the unidentified man with photos of M&*¥ Yuriy

Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI, British Liaison, and CRS.

.It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely ke

identifiable with the unidentified man.

5. Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas," shows an
Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the
author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination
of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code
name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, bears
a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuriy Ivanovich
MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul"identified the
picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhiltit #237 as
having been taken at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City,

either in the foyer or just outside.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Latin America Division

ATTN : Chris Hopkins
FROM : Graphics and Authentication Division/Senior Operations Officer
SUBJECT : Photo Comparison

REFERENCE : DDO/LA Division Memo, dated 25 March 1977

1. On 23 March,Chris Hopkins of Latin America Division handcarried
photographs to OTS/GAD for identification comparison. These photos were
examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise
and Identification Section.

2. The results of the comparison is as follows:

A. Facial Shape - Close similarities, although there are slight
differences which are probably due to subject's age differences.

B. Chin - Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing
jis most apparent here.

C. Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of
time factored in.

D. Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities.
(Comparison of eve detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)

E. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but
the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend
from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet. This could
be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting.

F. Mouth - The shape, proportion and expression of the mouth and
the whole area from the tip of the nose to the tip of the chin is perhaps
the most distinctive characteristic of both subjects. Here the similarities
are very close.

G. The proportions of the head, check bones and the body style of
the younger man tend to indicate he is of slavic origin.

3. The results of this type comparison are rarely absolute and are
usually limited by poor photo quality or differences in viewing angle.
With that understood it is our opinion the two subjects of the forementioned
photo comparison could very likely be the same person. If additional
photographs of the subjects, particularly if they are of better quality,
are obtained, we would be happy to examine those as well.

PLACE & DATE ACQ. BY souRCE US/October 1971
THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE US biophysicist who had conversations with Yu I Moskalev and Alex
Moiseev during the visit of the two Soviets to the US in October 1971.

1. In October 1974 br Yu T Moskalov,/Institute of Biophysics, Ministry
of Public Healtij—vescow and Dy Alex Moissey, Central Advances

Institute for Training of Physicians, Moscow, visited several US
biological and biophysical research facilities. During one of these
visits it was learned from Moskalev that ine is the Chairman of the
USSR equivalent to the US National Council on Radiation Protection.
In this position, ‘Moiseev is Moskalev'’s secretary.

2._ Molseev was a difficult individual to figure out. He stated that his
“training is in health physics and that his job in the USSK is to be
informed at all times of the status of US health physics and radiation
protection programs. He said that he reads the US journal “Health
Physics" regularly as well as other Western radiation research journals.
Although in discussions with Moiseev he appeared to be technically
competent, he kept very close to Moskalev and rarely let him out of
his sight. If Moiseev is Moskalev's “guardian” (as he appeared to be)
he let his own guard down during a cocktail party hosted by Dr David
Taylor, Department of Biophysics, Inatitute of Cancer Research, Selmont,
UK. During the course of the evening Moiseev consumed countless gin
and tonics until he could barely articulate. Moskalev, on the cther
hand, sipped one or two drinks all evening.

3. Mos Vv was a very adept diplomat. He finds it easy and
venient to adopt his conversation to whatever kind of group he is
with. He talked at considerable length about the role of women in the
Soviet economy and mentioned that his own vife is a pathologist. He
was always much freer in his conversation when Moiseev vas out of
hearing.

4. In terms of his professional work, Moskalev stated that he has a
program in the USSR of exposing dogs to various doces of radiation
to learn the biomedical effects of radiation. It is a program quite
similar to that at the Lovelace Foundation in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
The major difference being that whereas the Lovelace inhilation
experiments involve only the beagle dog, the Soviets do not use a
controlled breed, but rather use mongrels. Moskalev's budget, which

he implied was sufficient, comes from the Soviet Ministry of Health.
The actual Soviet work with the dogs is virtually parallel that in
the US. It involves studying the low level effects of radiation
from inhaled or injected uaterials.

Moskalev's work appears to be very good as far as it has gone.

But he has only worked with nitrates and chlorides of plutonium,

not with plutonium oxide. Oxides (solid components) should be of
interest to anyone working in this field because the chemical forms
of plutonium are quite useful to know about when doing accident type
studies -- to understand plutonium metals it is essential to know
about plutonium oxide. Whether the Soviets are working only with
solutions rather than oxides is not known. It is always possible,
of course, that Soviet work with plutonium oxides is classified.

Dr. J. F. Park - Past, present, and future experiments on the
biological effects of inhaled plutonium in laboratory animals;
therapeutic removal of inhaled plutonium, and USSR recommendations

to the ICRP to lower plutonium MPC's were discussed. These Sovict
scientists have completed more work on the biological effects of
inhaled plutonium in animals than any other research group except
our own laboratory. The interchange of experimental methods, results,
and concepts was valuable for planning our future reseazch and
evaluating the results of past and present research. Since they
have reported biological effects of inhaled plutonium in experimental
animals at extremely low exposnre levels and recommended to the ICRP
that limits of exposure should be lowered, the opportunity to
understand and evaluate their experimental results, interpretation,
and logic in making their recommendations was very useful.

Dr. V. H. Smith - Drs. Moiseev and Moskalev were reasonably well
acquainted with the field of therapy for plutonium poisoning but
not intimately in terms of details or recent Soviet literature; the
former because his field was more on the ecological side, and the
latter because he has concentrated on radiation effects and ceased
active work on removal about ten years ago. Dr. Moskalev was inter-
ested in our plans to test phosphorothioi¢c. acids as removal agents }
and mentioned his own work on the removal of !#4ce with DTPA as an
evamnle of rne rimindg of treatment. He scared DTPA was qivciu a.v. i

to humans in the USSR, not by inhalation, anda that Zn-DvPA was not |
used ox being experimented with. |The latter is difficult to believe, .
due to his former close relationship with Dr. Catsch. He was not ~ C
Satisfied with the lack of side effects of multipl@™DTPA treatments

and said that some problems with bone in long-term experiments could

be due to DTPA but he wasn't aware of the details. Answers te questic:
about other treatments than DTPA, experience in treating humans, ov

future plans were nov obtained because presuccbly this was nota

primary research concern of Dr. Moskalev, although he did state

there was considerable research effort in this field. :

Dr. C. L. Sanders discussed our low-level inhaled 23805 studies
(life-span), metabolism of plutonium and cellular interaction with
Pu0g particles. The Russians were particularly informative in —
describing their low-level life span studies with 239pyu, It was
learned that Dr. Moiseev is primarily a radioecologist who worked
in Siberia and is familiar with oil pipe lines and associated
ecological problems such as arctic and lake pollution problems.

Dr. J. E. Ballou discussed their studies with soluble plutonium
compounds, comparative metabolism and effects of DTPA, and our

americium, plutonium, and cerium work. Dr. Moskalev had tricd

inhaled EDTA therapy many years ago to no avail. He was interested -
in our work with age effects on gut absorption and wanted to know

why the very young absorb more plutonium. He agreed there is —
prolonged gut transit time and different intestinal morphology in

Dr. R. Masse,; CEA as above,

Mrs. Ann@ Low-Beer picked up the four guests in Sm Francisco and brought
them to the Donner Laboratory where they were greeted by Dr. John Lawrence,
Drs. Donald Van Dyke, James MaRae, and Howard Parker took them on a short
tour of the Anger camera facility and whole-body counting and scanning
equipment. The current uses and potential in medical diagnosis were dis-
cussed. Major questions concerned the use of these instruments in monit~-
oring and assessing the extent of persons contaminated with radionuclides
in industrial accidents.

_ Lunch was attended by Dr. Hardin Jones, the four guests, Drs. Van Dyke and
- Parker, and Dr. Patricia Durbin, who acted as hostess and guide thrcugh

the day. Topics discussed at lunch were centered about the Transuranium
symposium, The efficacy of two new techniques to remove lung contamina-
tion by-alpha-emitting isotopes yas considered. The two techniques are
lung lavage and aerosolized chi ing agents, particularly DTPA.

human Pu metabblism were considered at great length. New areas of re=-
search in internal emitters problems were considered including the influ-

Dr. Durbin proposed a collaborative effort with two of Dr. Moskalev's
‘colleagues. They have collected data on human skeleton weights, but
now do not have the time or interest to write up their material. Dr.
Durbin has collected all of the 19th century and early 20th century
human bone weight data and would like to add the modern Russian material
to the set. Dre Moskalev greed to propose a joint article with his
colleagues looking towards publication in an international journal. He
sur ‘ested that the original data would be forwarded in any case as soon
as it cculd be copied.

In the late afternoon the visitors toured (vriefly) the Bevatron guided
by Ralph Thomas; the californium separation facility guided by Francis
McCarty; and the Hi~lac guided by Al Ghiorso, Dr. Moiseev, who is a
physicist, was very much intrigued by the proposal to make an advanced
scientific instrument by joining the Bevatron and the Hi-lac. Dr, Moska-
lev was not interested in how the machines worked, "physics was not his

is said. but” asked what he asa biclogist might do in the nature
of radiobiology experiments with such machines. , :

Dr. Moskalev regretted that it had not been possible to visit with Dr.
obias. (We could probably have fit in a few minutes or made arrange-
ments for the following day, but I had run them ragged with sight-seeing

the day before, Monday was very full, and frankly they were exhausted
and needed rest. pwd). They would also have liked to visit the Medical
Services group. Mrs. Low-Beer tried to fill them in on the duties and
routine of that group.

Comments on money, budgets, problems of communication, demands on time

such as committees, etc. ran thpough all of the conversations. Dr. Nenot

and Dr. Moiseev spoke English and understood it well. Dr. Nobkalev and |

Dr. Masse understood more English than they could speak. ALI four are .

One further point needs to be added. Although nuclear medicine is not
a cuurent specialty in either country, and the use of nuclear medical K
techniques, especially as diagnostic tools, is very limited, the two

physicians indicated thay they personally were much interested, and there

was a definite trend in both countries towards more and more use of

such tools. "It is’ coming", they said.

4, Lafuma explained that from his point of view he was concerned with only
two primary aspects of human contact with plutonium, inhalation and wounds.
His studies have shown, of course, that the earlier treatment is begun the
better the results; but also he has found it easier to decontaminate an
area of the body exposed to plutonium through contact or a wound than to
remove it from the lungs. Lafuma has used intravenous injection exclusively
for the treatment of wounds and finds that a very significant amount of the

5 transuranium particles are discharged from the body in urine. For the treatment
4 of inhaled particles, Lafuma has used both DIPA aerosols and injection, He find

Brighton, UK, 3-8 May 1970. . :

2. The nature of the Sutton meeting was such that few significant scientific 72
positions were taken: however, in general, the giiality of the paners 4
very high. The scheduled Soviet participantss P V Ramzayev and/FNU, c
were presumably not permitted by the USSR to attend: D Panov (Yugoslav

“wae in the 0S, and D fijuric (Yugosiavia) did not attend for unknown reasons.
The countries represented were UK (26), Italy (5), France (1), Sweden (2),
Poland (1), South Africa (1), and the US (7). . .

3. To the extent that the proper "half-life for lead in man" was discussed,
the consensus appeared to be that (a) the loss rate can not he represented
as a single exponential; (b) the presently available data on baboons and
beagle dogs does not extend for a sufficient period of time to provide a
measure of the "last slow rate loss constant"; (c) it is likely that lead
and radium loss rates will differ because of thé selective reutilization of
Pb in bone. D Barltrop (UK) and US researchers have been performing
experiments which indicate that lead is not bound’ by red cell membranes,
but at sites in the cell interior. ; : \ \ .

4. CR RL1L (UK) provided a useful summary of the contribution of polonium
to human radiation dose. We stipulated that the distribution of polonium
will depend on whether it is administered as polonium per se or is allowed
to grow in an animal as the daughter of an ingested parent. This is a
significant consideration to biological researchers engaged in dose
calculation work.

5. Twenty-nine countries and five international bodies were represented at the
Second Congress of the International Radiation Protection Association.
WG Marley (UX) was the congress president and WJ Dunster (UK) was the
secretary of the scientific program committee. The congress shared the
common problems and advantages of similar large meetings. Concurrent
sessions inevitably brought about some conflicts in important papers,
discussion was generally absent or quite limited, and there was the usual
number of papers given in "broken" English by foreign scicatists.

. this conference, he did not drink at all. He did mention, however, that

he had written the English version of the paper he presented bimngeLf and
said he could read and write English quite well but was deficient’ in the

spoken language.

2. Moskalev's paper concerned the results of a series of experiments utilizing
an unusually large number of rats and mice. The numbers he used were far in
excess of those that would be used in a western laboratory, These figures
were undoubtedly meant to impress his western associates. The data he pre~
sented was primarily on Strontium 90. His findings indicated that Strontium
90 was much more toxic than had been reported anywhere in western literature
and that it was more carcinogenic than has been previously reported. His
technique was almost exclusively injections of radio nuclides. The control
he had on his animals was not explained, but very likely was very poor. He .
claims to have been able to induce cancer in laboratory animals at permissible
exposure levels for atomic workers in the US. The animals were not examined

some propaganda of this report by asking in a small group, "Why did you
do this?" almost accusing Spiez of doing it himself.

Moskalev left the conference a little upset, It was suggested that he
might visit a US laboratory en route home, and considerable time was

expended to arrange this visit. -However, he apparently took a different
route and made no effort to tell anyone of his plans, and he did not
visit the laboratory. He soak copious notes on-all-panska, whic ats

I understand a Polish scientist had been invited to the conference. However,
when his paper was submitted, the reviewer criticized it quite severely and
suggested changes. As a result, the Polish scientist apparently decided not
to attend the conference.

Three French scientists asked to be invited when the symposium was first '
announced. They even gave titles to their papers and the papers were put

on the program. However, they later withdrew and no French scientists
attended the meeting, .

2. It appears to me that the Soviets have a strong tendency toward experi- -
ments that enable them to study radiation effects on large animals. uo
They do not seem interested in radiation response — the effect on tissue;
on the other hand, they concern themselves with metabolic effects, which
are important because they are related to the ability to suppress inmunity
mechanisms. They stress immnology and transplants.

“7 * Shugar of the Warsaw Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Academy
- of Sciences of Poland. Though a highly competent scientist and a dedi-
_ cated Communist, Shugar seems to be short of funds. The organizing
. committee of the Congress sent him money to insure his presence at Cortina
d'Ampezzo. He ‘and his wife drove by automobile from Poland to Italy. .
“- Shugar introduced me to one of his students - K L Wierzchowskl. In per-
forming the introduction Shugar declared the young man was highly capable
and. had a brilliant future.

The International Committee of Photobiology had an executive committee
meeting at Cortina d'Ampezzo. It was decided to hold a photobiology

symposium in the late summer of 1967 on the Island of Hvar, Yugoslavia.

The symposium will emphasize photosynthesis.. The general plan calls

for participation by about 100 scientists, with emphasis being placed

on invitations to the younger scientists in the Sov Bloc. The chief. -.

Qe “hat is your critique of his argument?

ze Well, a mass of work ‘has been done with the smaller animals. in “ variuos .
laboratories and we are beginning to get certain generalities about the
nature of radiation injury, or at least certain kinds of radiation.
dajy sry, ond therefore I think it is worthwhile to pursue it.:* As you
wight iuagine, I presented a paper on radiation lethality and was. among —
those to whose work Moskalev objected. o

to effects in the central nervous system=—th ney ure very interested in
this and US people have tended to ignore this area.. So conceivably . ..
“oskalev is oriented to CNS work and physiological functions, I do not
know. But quite a lot of the Soviet work has a different orientatio :

may be ‘safely assumed that the Russians are using very advanced methods _ -
for detecting and measuring the various energies of neutrons--the
dosimetry of neutrons. ‘In the biological effect, I think they are

‘with respect to animal work is sophisticated.: They are‘advanced in this.

of these than they are in biological effects of radiation.

The most interésting aspect of meeting was conduet and contributions of Prof
OIPricomiun an Man"; no abstract was presented. alev_svoke
bowsver, he changed the title to "Problems of Kineticsof lptake and Retention
of Radioisotopes." During his presentation, it was suggeste that the retention

of multiple dosis of Sr90 in the rat could not be predicted on the basis of
questi via tra iti a

single injection bhudies. After con { oning f
» we concluded he meant by this that

1 ; aniral. In om event, his paper presented nothing
new and could by described as being rather e ementary.

In contrast, Prof Moskalev's questions throughout the four day meeting covered
a wide range of topics, and left one with the impression that he was a competent
individual. In response to questions, however, his answers were far from
satisfactory. He have no specific answers to questions regarding Soviet ex-

perience with radioisotopes in man.
