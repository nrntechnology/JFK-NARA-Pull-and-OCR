Embassy linea will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority. —

(3) CCI (Independent Peasants' Center), radical, anti-Mexican
Government organization. Having been banished from Mexico
until after the 1964 elections for anti~government activities,

the USSR, obstensibly to visit his daughter who is a student
at the Friendship University in Moscow,

3. Alonso AGUILAR Monteverde

who is the titular head of the MLN (National Liberation
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Communist front. Ne is a

several leftist figures of various echelon, including Gen.
Lazaro, CARDENAS, the. Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, and Polish,
Soviet; and Chinese Communist officials. TAMAYO's son has
studied in Warsaw and travelled to the USSR and Communist

China.
5. Jose David ALFARO Siqueiros

. imprisoned for eight (8) years as a consequence of the role

he played in the Communist-inspired railroad stike of 1959,

He is a leader of .the PCM (Mexican Communist Party) and has
visited the Soviet Union, He fought for the Loyalist Army

in the Spanish Civil War and was later arrested in Mexico

for complicity in the murder of Leon TROTSKY's secretary.
ALFARO has a long history of pro-Communist, anti-U.S. leanings.

6. Roberto ROMERO Adams

ROMERO is an informant for the Cuban Intelligence Service
in Mexico.

7. Enrique GONZALEZ Pedrero

Pro-Communist professor at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, GONZALEZ Pedrero has contributed to the
writing or editing of at least five (5) leftist publications
in Mexico. He is a member of the National Committee of the
MLN, has alledgedly received training in the Soviet Union,
and has travelled to Cuba twice in recent times.

8. Ignacio ACOSTA Laguass

contact with high-level personnel of both the Cuban and

9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad -, Federal Sccurity Police

The princtpal functions of this security unit are to:
(1) Provide a plain~clothed security detail for the President,
(2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both

the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and

(3) .perform investigations and arrests of primarily political
offenses. The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,

‘ insecure, and unreliable. Their professional characteristics

are best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.
The position, at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as

Directér General of DFS is precarious,

10. Politica

A Marxist anti-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in
Mexico, Politica 1s printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,
the samc shop which prints La Voz de Mexico. In addition to
the modest revenues derived From a circulation of 15,000
to 25,000, Politica is financed by the Soviet Embassy, the
MLN, the PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy. AS an
indication of the Mexican government's assessment of the
capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it
is worthwhile noting that Politica frequently experiences a
great degree of difficulty Im printing and circulating itself
due to the government's repressive efforts.

11. Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN)

Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,
the MLN today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual
interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the
ranks of the PRI, the PPS, the PCM, the CNC and the UGOCM,

The MLN's objective ts to gain leftist political represen-
tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists
into its camp. As a consequence of this objective, the mission
of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy

by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and

peasant masses,
12. Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAL)

The CTAL has recently been replaced by the CUTAL (Single
Confederation of Latin American Workers). Until recently, the
14-00000

‘ ~4-

pro-Communist, CTAL, which is described as being the liaison
bureau of the WFTU (World Federation of Trade Unions) whose
headquarters are in Prague, was headai by Vicente LOMBARDO

Toledano.

13. Prensa Latina

_ Operatiéng directly under the Cuban Communist regime,
Prensa Latina is obstensibly a press service, In reality,
however, it is the official propaganda organ of the Cuban
Government. Prensa Latina works closely with Tass, the
Soviet Agency: with Hsinhua, the Chinese Agency ;and with
Cetepka, the Czechoslovakian Agency.

MSNORANDUM FOR: Chief, Forelgn Intelligence
SUBJECT: TDY to Mexico City

1. After taking a good lock at LIZNVOY and LIFBAT, I would agree
with the persons I talked with in Mexico; they maintain that any well-
run tap operation should produce substantial intelligence information,
provided the targets are of intelligence interest, and provided also
there are people at the station who look for it and are able to recog-
nize it. The case of LITBAT is interesting in this respects It bas
deen deprived of its most productive lines in favor of LIZNVOY, and
yat its intelligence preduction compares favorably, with that of the
other productive taps, except LIENVOY.

2. Maxico has people who can detect any Little item of intelli-
gence significance, This includes the Chief of Stacion, vho goes over
the highlightu of the previoua day's take every morning and marks
certain items for action by station case officers or reports officers.
The reports officers work on copies of the take at the same tine.

3. ‘There are several aspects of LIENVOY that make it an excellent
operation and an cutstanding producer of intelligence. I will describe
thes in detail when my notes got here from the station. The principal
factors in the success of LIENVOY seem to be the rollowing. .

a. The agreement mede with top Mexican officials, unlike
many such agreements elsewhere, 18 as much in effect today as it
was at the start: the targeting is not based on personal politica;
the intercept staff has stayed on the Job; the equipment is con-
sidered to be on loan from CIA.

ob. The native monitoring staff has reached a peak of effec-
tiveness that evaryone at the station praises very highly.

ec. The station is organized to handle the tuke speedily aa
soon as it comes in. The Chief of Station, the case officers, the
reperts officers, all work on it at the same tima and excnange
views on hot items. They do not let reports backlogs accumulate,

14-0000

d. Bach new item on a target person is linked to a past
histery; what appears as a fragmentary bit in a. conversation
becames a meaningful developmant, in a contimuous atery. Contle
nmuity on the Job makes this possible.

@. The equipment is kept in good working order by complete
cleaning dod checking of asch unit orcs a month. The 32 unite
in use today are those installed in 1959.

hk, A detailed description of LIBNVOY and ite counterpart LIVRAT
should provide good models with which to compare other tap operations, .
It should give criteria for good procedures. It should give some. idea
of. the desirable size of such operations, considering the available
targets, the size of the station, and the other tasks and operationa of
the station. It should show what the station puts into ita tap opera-
tions and what it gets cut of then. LIRNVOY and LIFEAT are an interesting
example of twd interacting operations, one Joint and the other independ-
ent.

5. My otay in Mexico was as interesting and fruitful as it waa
enjoyable. And I hope it was not too great a burden on the station.

Bear Willard:

This may seem to you like a voice out of the void, but I
always carry in my mind your repeated invitations to visit you
and remember clearly your acquaintance and kindness to ny
brother. Strangely enough it seems to continue to be true
that the only escape from this jail-like desk is back to ny
old area where I nevor expected to roturn--I even had one this
Spring. Just now I have a specific reason for wanting to
visit your place, that is, in addition to our own personal

reasons.

For some time I have boen bent on trying to push for sore

positive information from taps and audio, I reniiza tnat it
4e taken for granted around the world that the purpose of taps

ane audio is for operational leads, particularly in the KUDESS
field;

In one or two places in the world, positives production is
outstanding and we have been making a study for sone tiwe
trying to see why it works in some cases and not in others,
Cns of the outstanding examples is LIFEAT and especially LISYVOY.
Tnesa seem to be far ahoad of other similar operations around
the world even though they seem to approach tho problem
sonevhat similarly. It occurred to mo that wo might find out
what makes yours so especially effective by having one of ay
paople go to your station for a few days to talk with you and
your officers and get the detailed story, I could then take
another look at the other operations and see what's nissing or
what's wrong, I'm suro this would be of great help to the
place as a whole. If you agree, I vill send Paul VY. Levister
(Iden), the editor of our Foreign Intelligence Series (our
Staff doctrinal papers, the first few of which have been
dispatched to you). He could be in Mexico City on or about
23 September, or any time thereafter that is more convenient
for you and your pooplo, Could you let us know your reaction
by cable, and 1f it's favorable, when you would prefer to have
Levister arrive, Ye would confirm his MTA by cable.

On 7 Auguat 1963 the Station EE case officer requested LIENVOY coverage of
the Yugoslav lines. Arrangements are being made to put these lines in within

the near future.
3. Processing of LIENVOY Information,

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish from ten
lines (five Cuban Embassy aad five Soviet Embassy), DIR-60764 dated
13 August 1963 asked the Station to send to Headquarters one copy of the full
transcripts from the Cuban Embassy linea. These are being forwarded on a
“weekly basis, The first group ia being forwarded as an attachment to HMMA#22000
dated 21 August 1963, If they do not please Headquarters officers who desire
them, it is requested that the Mexico Station be promptly advised with any

suggestions for changes,

On 6 August 1963 Orville HORSFALL, staff ayent, arrived in Mexico
to work presently as a unilateral monitor but eventually as the supervisor of
a tap center either under LIENVOY or LITEMPO. He has established himeelf
outside and is presently at work eliminating the backlog of Sovict tapes,

Douglas J, FEINGLASS continues to do the Ruasian from LIENVOY,
the Russian from two LIFEAT lines on Soviet targets, and the Russian from
the LIPAWN audio operation, In addition, FEINGLASS sends clipped transcripts

to the Station ready for 201 files. ,

+. Exploitation of LIENVOY Informatign,

HMMW<-II831 dated 6 August 1963 indicated that Headquarters was
not well informed on the way the Mexico Station exploits operational leads from
LIENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART haa instructiona to alert
the Station immediately if a U.S, citizen or English speaking person tries to
contact any of the target installations, This is done by a telephone call from
outside the tap center at a pay phone to Robert B, RIGGS inside the Station,
Emergency meetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch),
RIGGS meets AREHART within fifteen minutes at a presarranged downtown
lecation and recoives the reel with an extract of the pertinent conversation,
The reel is then taken to the Station and given to the case officer responsible
for the target the person was trying to contact. Headquarters ia notified by
cadle of the action taken. Only in rare cases is information on a U.S, citizen
passed without prior Headquarters approval,

Other leads appear in the full transcripts or daily resumen, They
also are exploited by the Station case officer responsitle for the target where
the lead appears. For example, on le August 1903 Boris KAZANTSEV,
recently arrived Counsclor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target
in Mexico, called hie wife at their residence. The number was not listed but
was immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the
number was the switchboard of theapartment house where KAZANTSEV and
several other familics live. The reason the Station checked out this number
was to put unilateral coverage on it if poesible; however, the switchboard was
beyond the Station's capability tohandie.

Maryknoll priest Felix MCGOWAN contacted the Cuban Embassy on

to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Professor WEBB (fnu) of the University of Louisiana contacted Mexican
Communist Jorge L. TAMAYO Castillejos, prominent Mexican Marxist intel=
lectual and professor at the University of Mexico, and arranged to meet with
him on 31 July 1963, MEXI=5563 reported this contact to Headquarters for
dissemination and action by ODENVY.

Bartolo (fnu) contacted former Governor of Baja California, Braulio
MALDONADO Sandez on 16 July 1963 regarding the aale of Cuban pesos. MEXI-5569
reported this contact to Headquarters for dissemination and action by ODENVY.

1. The referenced cables describe tvo recent incidents in which the
Mexico City Btation made use of LIENVOY information to take investigative or
punitive action against security suspects. The first reference reported the
Adentifying and "trapping" .of a PBPKIME citizen who was offering his services
to the Cuban Embassy, and the second reported the deporting of a Cuban IS
agent identified by LIENVOY material.

- , 2. In both of these cases, there seems to have been departure from the
extreme caution with which the Mexico Station has always handled the LIENVOY
material. Admitting that the cables do not set out enough facts to enable us
to make a final judgment, ve still feel a little uneasy dout this use of

- LIENVOY material. In the first ease, the Station sent an agent to the suspect's
hotel, posing as a Cuban Embassy official to "trap" him into revealing his
intentions. The scheme, which was admittedly clever, eucceeded, but ve vere
concerned sbout what would have happened 1f the Cubans themselves had decided
to contact the individual. Would not the LIENVOY operation have been exposed
to some extent? We grant that the Cubana and other bloe personnel in Mexico

City may suspect LIENVOY exists, but they do not know it --- yet. Incidentally,
we had no traces on the PEPRIMER involved.

3. The second case involved the detection, spprehension and deportation
of a Cuban IS agent whose whereabouts wero learned through LIENVOY. Fron the
— few facts we know about this case, we cannot really judge the “possible risk to
LIENVOY. ‘The Mexico Station created LIENVOY and has always guarded its security
with eecrupulous care. Has there teen u change?

4. Finally, pleasenste that both these cases should have been roported
to Heedquarters before action was taken. In general, arrests, deportation,
trapping, or other action against security suspects should be approved by Head-
quarters, except where in the opinion of the Chief of Staticn, the added time
needed vould seriously impsir ODYOKE security or the securlty of our operations.
The Mexico Station has ulways done this, and the coincidence of two recent cases
where. it was. not dane inspires us to query you. Please let us know your views.

On 5 June 1963 Douglas J. FEINGLASS, Staff Agent, arrived in

Mexico to replace Howard G, SAFARANO, the Station translator for Russian

language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines, SAFARANO

- departed PCS on 15 June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations
officer, FEINGLASS’ usefulness to the Station is handicapped by his inability
to transcribe the Spanish portion of the reels from the Soviet coverage, This,
despite Headquarters assurance that he cou] do these transcriptions, Howeved,

_ he has settled into outside living conditions with a minimum of difficulty,

. For the present, a monitor from the LIENVOY ‘tap center is transcribing he
Spanish portion ofthe above take, There isa Station backlog of Soviet tapes

* numbering about 50 wiich accuimutated during the pertod when FEINGLASS
was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish, The backlog is being
retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives. In addition to the Russian trans-
crptions, FEINGLASS also ellps the transcripts for individual dossiers thus
relieving the S.ation Cas¢ Officer for Soviet operations of a clerical task,
After the arrival of HORSFALL. the Mexico Station will review requirements
for oviside translators and make recommendations for future use of

FEINGLASS,

In early June to support the AMROD operation, the Statiou requested
full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lines, In adiitlon, Thomas G,
URQUHART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the
LIENVOY tap center co review the traffic on a current basis,

4, Exploitation of LIENVOY information,

Coverage of the Cuban,’ Czech, and Soviet Embassies provided
dezails of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data.
In most all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance
information when reservations were made, Confirmation of the travel Is,
of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project,

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might
be U.S, citizens making contact with Soviet or Soviet Satellite Embassies for
political or other reasons, On 20 May 1963 an English speaker (dentifying
himself as Albert Kennedy called the Soviet Embassy and requested political
i asylum for himself, his wife and seven children, Subsequent investigation

revealed that he was also a protection case at the U.S, Embassy in Mexico,

Appropriate U.S, agencies were advised of Subject's contact with the Soviet
Embassy,

5. Liaison,

During this reporting period there were no mectings between the
Chief of Station KUBARK and LITENSOR; however, regular contact was
maintained with LLELEGANT and LIERGO,

6, Security,

There were no security incidents within the project during this
month, As reported in MEXI-5170. 26 June 1963, the true name of a
KUBARK case officer was revealed co the Cubun Embassy by a caller who
refused to identify himself, From the transcript it apgeared that the Cuban
Embassy was nov interested in making comiact with the caller who claimed to
have details of KUBARK operations in Mexico,

Douglas J, FEINGLASS daily to deliver and receive the Soviet Embassy
traffic, PARMUTH's assistance in obiaining llving quarters and necessary
sterile office furniture was responsible for the case with which FEINGLASS
was able to seztle {nto his-outside staff agent status,

In the opinion of Thomas G, URQUHART, wha has spent some tine
inside .h2 iap center, Arnold F, AREHART is doing a commendable job tn
the management of the center, - In addition, AREHART has a general aware-
ness of the take from each line, When leads of {nierest appear, he notifles
the Scation immediately so that action can be taken,

Willard C, CURTIS contacts LIENVOY-2 when the Station desires
contact with the Mexicans directly or when AREHART is absent,

ACTIGN REQUIRED REFERLNCES:
Action: See paragraph 4 below

1. Transmitted herewith, for purpuses of Headquariers faniliarizaticn,
is a typical one day LIENVOY product of the Soviet lines. (Note that the
Station has additional LIFEAT coverace on the personal lines ef Colonel
Aleksandr “cor;iyevich SIDCROV and Svyateslav Fedorovich KUZNSTSOV, and on the

office line of Vludimir Ivanovich SAMOKHIN).

2. Except for the weekend period, the Spanish langua-:e transeript
reaches the Soviet case officer on the duy followin; the actual transcription +
at the most usually two days after the transcription. ‘the Station's Russian
Janguace translater.-transcribes the Russian language portions immedialely, and
this product reaches the Soviet case officer about an hour or two after receipt
of the Spanish reporting. Simulvaneously, flimsy copies of the above have been
yiven to the reports officer and to other interested Station officers. The
first copy is kept in a StatLon chrono Ekle, for purposes of perzanent recom.
It is annotated for ZONAR purposes.

3. Whe Soviet officer, Lucy A. Dillin)4r, and other cfficers, read the
product quickly for the Immediate purpose of obtuinin.; exploitable LOIMPROVE

or other operational leads, and/or reportable intellizence. Aer this initial
scannin:t, the product is literally cut up, with each clippin: of significant
conversation sent Lo COS and to various Station officers for their information “
and/or action. Whenever pertinent, the actual LIENVOY clip is sent to Head-
quarters, for information or action - or a sumeury of the clip is sent to
Headquarters in dispatch form. Each clip is eventually routed to the Station's
registry where indexiny and filing; is completed.

4, ‘The Station finds that this Soviet LIENVOY clippin: prosram provides
the files on the individual Soviet staffers with a cather ocd picture of their
activities and personality. (These individual files are of ccurse aumented
with information derived from double agent operations, LIEMPIyY reporting, Head-
quarters provided information, ODACID reportin;;, newspaper clippings and other
miscellaneous reporting). In many cases, however, the backbone cf a Station
file on a Soviet may derive principally from bits and pieces of LIEXVOY product.

Satecory station files receive the clips pertaining to Soviet commercial +
activities, propaganda activities, Soviet contacts, etc. Very often, 4 sinalé
clipping may have te be ‘copied to be sent to the files of several individual .

Soviets and/or to one or more cacegory files.

5. Unfortunately, the Station does not have sufficient personnel
available to analyze and collate periodically the LIE: VOY and other Station
product in the individual Soviet files for transmittal to Neadquarters for
its information; or possibly more important, for eventual transmittal to another
Station where a Soviet from Mexico City is reassigned. Headquarters attention
is directed again to NEXT-9805 of 17 January 1962 and allied correspondence
resardiny the destrability of ‘having o trained Headquarters TDYer work on these
raterials at the Station. Headquarters may now wish to reinvesticate the
possibility of finding a qualified staffer for this TDY assipnment.

‘The Cuban efforts at propaganda in Mexico in witch the Cuban
Ambassador to Mexico conferred with Raul Roa, Cuban Foreign
Minister, and suggested to hint Fidel Castro write a short

messase to the Mexican peuple ia Sicinpre on its ninth anniver=
sary of publication (see HMMA 19599).

The negative treatment to a Czech commercial representative
by Mexican Immigration authorities (see HMMA 19158),

The refusal by the Pan American Inszitute of Geography and
History of the Organization of American States to permit Teresa
Proenza Proenza, Third Secretary and Cultural Attache at the
Cuban Embassy, to attend the meeting held by it (see HMM 6438),

The embarrassment caused by thg.immorat-betavior of Mexican
female delegates to the Cuban 26 July celebration held in Havana
in 1961 according to Manuel Marcue Parinas of the perlodical
Politica as told io Teresa Proenza Proenza,

D, Liaison

With the approach of the GPIDEAL visit to Mexico 29 June - 1 July,
liaison activities greatly increased, COS visited LITENSOR on 28 June,
LITENSOR assured that there would be no problems in the GPIDEAL visit
and the safety of GPIDEAL was guaranteed and in the haads of LITENSOR,
At this meeting LITENSOR indicated his annoyance with the Cubans, (See
MENT 1253),

LIELEGANT turned over to the Chief uf Station a list of persons who
were put under surveillance in connection with the GPIDEAL visit, The list
also indicated those who were arrested, (Seo MEXIs 1244 and 1264),

Ata meeting hetd on 28 May 1962, the Chiet of Stacion, LIELEGANT,

aad LIENVOY/2 met with LIENVOY/1 and obtained his agreement to hire
: | LIENVOY/ 14 to work under LIENVOY/3 as a technical inspector in Telefonos
: Ge Mexico, The purpose in putting LIENVOY/L4 in this capacity is to have a
2 who would be more available to the LIENVOY Project and who “would see
w others might be tapping telephones” in Telefonos de Mexico, Further-
more, LIENVOY/I1 agreed to see to it that LIENVOY/14 would have "the
range and authority” co do the work,

Putting LIENVOY/ 14 as a technical taspecior within Telefonos, could
create problems for the LIFEAT Project, At the same time WILSTED is re-
sindying the LIFEAT system, improving it, tightening up the security and
alerting the base houses to watch for any apnormal activity on present laps.
It Ras Deen understood by the LIENVOY case officer that this has been done
and ic will be reported from time to time in future LIENVOY reports,

E, Security

For a report on security of the LIENVOY site for June 1962, see
peragraph 2 E of HMMA-19319 (RYBAT-1897) dated LO July 1962,

As was stated at the end of that paragraph, any surveillance or
security threat of the LIENVOY basehouse or personnel can eventually be
handled, should this be found necessary, by Chief of Stariea to LITENSOR,

to delay entry into the satehouse and casnally walk down the block.

The undersigued cut across Hudson Street tu avoid walking close to the

‘parked car and as he walked on Lerma, noticed the presence of a alow

_moving car behind him. This did act arouse too much suspicion siace

this area apparently specializes in street walkers and the local "tenorics®

cruise the streets looking for them, Aas the undersigned reached tho

, parked Q.P. car at the curner of Lerma acd Duero the slow moving auto

The uideraigued got in his own car, started down Larma, pasasd tha

35 minutes but could not spot either cne of the two Fiata.

lines which were out of order were probably due to the inherent problems of
the telephone company,

There was no change in the personnel for the month and it kept the
game schedule of work as reported for April,

H, Production

During May, LIENVOY produced the forty-five (45) positive intel-

The following message has been recoived from Nexico Citys
For King and Sayre from Ambassador Manns

. 1. As you kmov, some veeks ayo we became convinced that cnly chance
of getting Mexico to break relations with Cuba would bo on basis Cuban
intervention Mexican internal affaira, This of course was on agaiription
two thirds Ro treaty vote could not be obtained at Punta Dal Esto.

2. With this objective in mind Dept and CAS authorized me to turn \

over naterials describod in iN 12519 to appropriate Mexican official.
I cose Gustave DIAL Ordas.

3. Tid Ordas hes informed CAS that ho discussed this evidence with
Lopas Hatens wio exmressed surprisa and intersat. We discount Lopez Mateos
otatementy because ao you know he haa much better evidence of Cuban Embassy
intervention which he keeps strictly to himself and has nsvor told Cabinet
about, The evidence ve turned over to DiAc Urdaz has psyotological immortance
because Presidunt is now aware that DIA‘ Ordaz also known part of the story.
Ha ean sever bo sure that DIAZ Onins will not use this to supeort his oun

“antieconcuniot convictions if a showiown butwoen tne Comiiea and anti=Cormies

should occur in Kexico,

4, DIAZ Ordas has asked my through CAS whether I wold have any objection
if the informaticn wa furnished him were made public should an appropriate
oceasion arise in the future. ke said thers vould be no mention of tha U.S.
Govt and that dobermaeion vould present the evidence 98 collected by it.

5. I recommend that CAS and feot authorize me to inform DIAZ Ordaz that
we have no objection on ths basis ouslined by him. Season fur ay recomend=
ation is that on tha one hand we low: little by blowing the microphone oneration
einca battery 16 coheduled to axpira soon in any cass. We believe we are ina
position where we can safely deny thet we had anything te do with placing micros
phone. In this connection Diag Orias obviously belfeves our story that wo
pieked uw signal by routino dialing of different frequencica and that microphone
was presumably rlsced by Soviets to check on their satellites. Un other hand
affirmative answer to DIAZ Ordas will also implicitly suggest the vosstbility
that the time may come when wo ourselves night wish to make this information

public, I can think ef no better incentive to Lopes Mateoo to break relations
with Cuba than possibility Mexican public might eventually become aware of
extent te which Mextco has tolerated Cutan intervention in spite of its vaunted
devotion to the doctrine of non-intervention.

6. Finally I wish to say that I realise all of these maneuvers involve

some risk to U.S. but I believe reeurzence of Communist influence in last two

monthas requires unusual counteraction on our part.

7. DIAZ Ordaa has returned material to CAS for safe keeping and it is
now in our possession, He claims Le made no copies and we believe this probably

true.
