Although mixing the enpl es of the three companies wae dove deliberately .
to ‘break up a feeling of trust among employees who knew each: other,. ond aes
te introduce a feeling of fear’ concerning strangers, there has been clese - —~
cooperation on the technical level between employees of at least two

refineries. For example, technicians at Esso and Shell recently collaborated

because of HurricarsDonns. When the word got out that the refineriss -
were ehutting dom, ICP officials rushed in and protested vigorously that
there was no. denger, and that the action should not be taken, The
technicians then said, "Well, it is too late now," and they kept the .
refivsries shut down for three full deya, Both Shell and Boso technicians
concerned enjoyed this minor ect of sabotage hugely. uo

They also cooperated in dealying action when they were ordered to’ start
tke cat plant. LPG ic needed badly, cothe technicians decided to keep
the unit shut down. ICP officials screamed that it was unnecessary

and ordered then to start, but the technicians said that 1¢ wae not
practical because it was too difficult, and possibly dangerous, to stop
end stert the wnit. They aaid that the shortage of catalysts made it
impossible to figure on keeping the unit going, snd go it was aot the
right thing to do to start it at all. Consequently they have been able.
to keep the cat-units shut down completely since the storm. nr

eto exemple, hss a capacity of 36 theusand bbls per day on heavy crude, but ™'

Soviet crude, and it has been runaing at a rate of only 20 thoussnd bbls

2. The Soviet crude available to cste hes been coupatible with the refineries
and will not damage then, but in addition to not being able to get as
much volum, the refineries cannot get as mich fuel ofl because of light
ends. Thie is trus of all three usjor refineries. .

3. The refinerads vere designed for 26 gravity crude which is fairly heavy.
The Soviet crude is 33 gravity, and has ceused an imbalance in that
they are now Producing more gegoline than is needed. As a consequence,
Cuba is searchicg desperately for fuel of1. The USSR has said that it

- is not im a position to. supply fuel ofl and so Cuba has turned toward

. Mexico, even to the extent of attexpting to arrange deals whereby they
‘will erade gasoline for furl oil. ; ; :

“The imbalance of gesolins is indicated by ths fact that the Cabaiguen .

Guba will reach @ critical point abeut 1 Sep 60. The Esco refinery slowed
down from 26 thousand bble per day to 20 thousand bble per day because

company. ;
Source has had yeare | of experience ‘ta company operations ‘outatde the US. :
and hes been located in Cuba for many years, [Source is- normally available
for [epaserrosteee should this’ report generate additional requirements. ).

1. Ia Aug 60 the Castro regina gent two representatives to. the US to attempt .
to obtain replacement parte and machinery for the ofl industry. One of
these men is Julio Caunedo, on the staff of ICP, and the second is Leonel
de Paula Arias, a former ¢ employee of Eeso Standard oil SA..- .

— .

2. De Paula is about 28-29 years-old, 6'1", 180 lbs, He has black curly hatr.
and fair skin. He is married and I believe has one child. ie ie a Roman
Catholic; and has never been considered. as having any. Left-wing. inclinations,

3. Be Paul speaks excellent English, and I belteve. studied ta “the. us. He hep’
a degree in engineering and worked three yeare with the Esso refinery,
ssinly . in maintenance and construction. As of Jul. 60 he was. fection head
of the ‘Refining Department, Purchasing and Warehousing.

4. The choice of ‘de Paula to go to the US to obtain necessary supplies is
sound because he is the man which the company would have.chosen to do such
a Job 4£ required. He has a reputation of being a good hard worker,
intelligent and devendeble. He has « pleasant Personality and handles
binself very well. . an a -

S. De Paula was considered. one of the better. men of the plent end could be
' " elassed as a key technician because of his knowledgé, background, and -
ability, end it would definitely burt the Castro regime if he fled Cuba.
However the opportunities for employment in the oil industry in Latin
: America! are not good because there is considerable prejudice against
Cubans on the part of. other countries in which there are, refining. operations,
