Secret Service use police department to harass mee. Police department do
supply pencil of anesthesia gas to the manager of the building I live. The
manager do-or use certain people, to freeze me by anesthesia gas = then push
drugs, poison in my mouth to torture me = to take my sleep away = or bleed
by rectal and they use many other chemicals to brainwash'me to use me in

. political assassination which 1 refused.On January 20, 1976 in Sacramento on

8th and I Streets, man came to me from police or post office, U.S. Department

of Justice and freeze me by gas and told me to take gun, pistol and we will

caitiemenennt

strain order or respond to me what could be done.. The right wing in America

Besera Asenova, girl friend of Russian Consul came to my room and repeated that
Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald is assassin. He will kill President Kennedy.

On August 15, 1963 in Sofia, Bulgaria, at the airport in embassy car, I told to
Mr. Blackshire, American Vice Consul, that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald is assissin.

He has a weapon or has ordered one. Mr. Blackshire said it seems like he will
kill someone. 1 said that Mr. Lee H. Oswald is preparing to kill President

of the United States, John F. Kennedy. Mr. Blackshire said where will it happen.
I said they (right wing) will invite President, criticize him in the newspaper,
then kill him. Mr. Blackshire told me he will give the telegram to Department
of State and he gave me the address where to report.

At 9 asm. on August 19, 1963 in Washington, D. C., I went to see (Mr. Kippingan)
Director of Special Counselor Service Department of State at 1901 Pennsylvania
Avenue-llth floor. I told the Director that I have information about President
Kennedy. The Director said do not mention name of President Kennedy, only
respond to the questions. -The Director said tell us what will happen to Mr.
Lee Harvey Oswald then. I said Mr. Lee H. Oswald will be killed after kill
Kennedy. I said I will take the truth drug to tell the truth. Director tell
us who else get killed in this country. I said as I heard, that Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jre will be killed. Who will kill Dr. King, Jr. Negro leader?

1 said a man who is in prison at this time. (Mr. James Earl Ray was in prison
at that time.) Director asked where assassination will happen. I said in Dallas,
Texas. Director said if someone gave this information here I would expel the
mane Director did call on F.Bel. agents after FeBel. use anesthesia gas to
freeze me to drub me to keep amnesia.

I told Director Department of State that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald have a weapon.
