NOTE:

Info on was received from CIA that an individual with the same

last name was a member of Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS).
However, another source of CIA advised subject was not a member of
YIS, CIA has learned that an individual believed to be the subject

is being recalled to Yugoslavia, but this individual wishes to
remain in the U. 8.

21A desires verification of this information
because if it is true/CIA may wish to consider contacting subject
in an effort to persuade him to return to Yugoslavia under wntrol
of cia, (Bbabjece is supposed to return to Yugoslavia at end of
April, 1963 Nv Approach te subject by FBI is not recommended because
New York informants said in March, 1963, subject is net engaged in

intelligence activities and because State recently denied clearance
for approach in similar case.
