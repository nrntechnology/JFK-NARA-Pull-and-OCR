1. Forwarded herewith for Heacauarters information and
files is am Agent Service Record or Lin IhG-3.

2. As Addressees are aware, Wallace P. RAWTON recruited
and formerly handled LIRING-3 for the Hexico City Station,
Prior to ROHTON's PCS departure from Mexico City in July 1969,
it was deciced, after some discussion, to effect a turnover of
LIRING-3, rather than terminate him. Although LIRIKG-3 apparently
had been well "burned" with the Cubans, he seemed to have maintai:.ed
socd contacts with memers of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) of
Guatemala. {n addition, in May and June of this year, he had
begun to develop access to sane Panamanian revolutionaries of
interest. It was therefore decided to rur- LIRING-3 on a triat
besis to determine whether he could be used effectively against

“ Central American revolutionary targets, despite his problems with

the Cubans. :

i
3. ROVTON Introduced Leonard S$. TORMET, in alias, to LIRING-3_
on Tt July 1969. Although ROWION had represented himself to LIRING-3
as a Greek tusinessman, it was decided that it would be preferable
to “clear the air" somewhat with LIRING-3, at Teast by making it

clear that he was in touch with a WOLADY orzenization. Nonethe-
less, no specific exalaration was given LIRING-3 of his sponsor
and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told tnat TORMET would be
seeing him for some months, since ROWTON was leaving the country
for an indefinite period. ;

&, LIRING-3 was told that although TORHET was trusted by
ROWTON and collaborated with him, he represented a different
organization. LIRING-3 was also told that although he had in the
Past been receiving between 3,000.00 and 3,549.00 Mexican’ pesos
per month on an informal basis, TORMET's organization feit that
1,500 Mexican pesos per month ($120.00) woula te a fair salary at
this stage of the operation. TORMT explained that he was ewere
of LIRIKG-3's past activities directed against tre Cubans, and the
resuttant problems which hed arisen. It was explained that
TORMET’s interest was in Central American revolutionary activities.
In arcer to deal with LIRING-3's virtual "burneo" status with the
Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central American contacts that
the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that he tnerefore was no
longer directly involvec with any revolutionary groups or activities.
Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer eny assistance which
ne coujG proviue CO shy revoluLiUNariEs, ON Le basis UI is
leftist beliefs and the friendships which he hed made with FAR
members while in orison in Guatemala. It would then be a matter
of time before we could learn whether LIRING-2? «2s completely
blacklisted in all revolutionary circles beca:se of his prociems
with the Cubans or whether he could provide information of value.

5. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemec in good spirits -
and he seemed to accep~ the turnover without any qualms. . Inceed,
he pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after
he had been given various tasks to ao by ROWION which he had known
and warned in advance would cause suspicion. {t was agreed that
LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that at this
stage all that could te done was to attempt to circumvent the
existing problems. i
t

6. LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributeble telephone
number and false name to ask for (Identity) to set up meetings
with TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and
@ prearranged pickup point was decided upon. It should be noted
that TORMET's QP vehicle was used for this first meeting with
LIRING-3, which means it was of course exposed to LIRING-3.

7. Subsequent to this meeting, LIRING-3 never initiated
contact with the Station. Although he might have lost the new
telephone number he was given to use with TORMET, there is no
Indication he ever again tried to call ROWTON, who was in Mexico
for at least three weeks after the | July turnover to TORMET.

8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, ininc-3
has In effect terminated himself. Given the nature of this case--
the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as
@ RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years lwas never
very productive and-now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break

- off contact--it has been decided to make no effort to reestablish

contact with him.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECOK)

FROM: WH/1 (Marvin Prancis)

i
t
1
t

SUBJECT: 17 Septemt-r 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL :
re LIRUSG/3 & LIRING/4.

PARTICIPANTS: DRISCOLL, KiRBE, FRANCIS and Laurence
: PIPER (C/Wi{/2/G).

i
1. LIRING/4 is stil} very concerned about the im-
prisonment of LIRING/3. LIRING/4 wil) not travel to Cuba
until she is assured of the aafate n= TIDINE /D nnonnas-

as cvnorougniy discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out
the danger of attempting tv intercede on L/3's behalf.
through business contacts, L/4 contacted the Cubans for”
assistance but they stated there was nothing they could do.
They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money. L/3
has devised an open code whtch he uses in letters to let
L/4 know how he is. The letters are grim reading because
L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer.
Fellow prisoners have warned L/4 net to let the Guats
transfer him to another prison as this usually ends in the
prisoner being shot “while escaping.” One good result
from the continued imprisonment of L/3 is that both he and
L/4 are furthering their bona fides with the Cubans. ; :
2. L/4 is in telephone contact vith the Third Sécre-—
tary of the Mexican Enbassy in Guatemala. He has made
inquiries about L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign

_ Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the

assasination of the U.S. Ambassador) the Third Secretary
told L/4 there were three possibilities, the first which
he considered out of the question was that L/3 would be
shot, the second was that 1/4 would come to trial and'‘be

. released within a few weeks, and the third was that he would

receive a sentence of two or three years. Just prior 'to
departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted
to atrange a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a-
typed note under her apartment door. She did not make the
meeting. DRISCOLL later learned through phone tap material
that she callea the Cuban Eabassy and informed them the

|

. !
Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined
500 pesos. The purpose of the payment was not identified.
Later she made a call from the Cuban Embassy which indicated
she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay
the Mexicans. DRISCOLL. therefore, concluded she had not
returned to her apartment and did not get the note to make
their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba
Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and night see
the note but would be unable to identify the sender since
DRISCOLL uses a meaningless stheee as a signature. :

3. DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Nexico to
recontact L/4 to get the latect rasdinn an 1/98 stitus la
Guatvemaia. 41 the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3’s
release ir behalf of the Nexicans and if it appears he will
be held indefinately, DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility
of our doing something to get L/3 out so the operation | can
become active again.

4. In the above regard L/3 was discussed with us (ptr
of the Guatemala desk. Mr. PIPER believed the Station has
a high enough contact with the Guats (ES5M:JOR/20-Presidents
brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Vexican cospatriot out
of prison and back to Mexico with a minimun security risk.
DRISCOLL said he would initiate the cabie upon his return to —
Mexico after he has talked with L/4. DRISCOLL felt he should
possibly travel to Guatemala and have a preliminary neet with
L/3 before Guat Station makes any all out effert to officially
request L/3's release. If, after seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is'satis-
fied that L/S is still an ally and is willing to cooperate
after his release then DRISCOLL believes we should atterpt to
have the Station intercede with ESMAJOR/20. Hopefully, ESMAJOR/
20 will arrange the release so that all involved believe it
has been done at the request and urging of the Mexican Govern-
-- -> - ment. DRISCOLL, however, would like L/3 and L/4 to believe
he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in oxder :
to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation
al tasks he will levy on them. .

b. "Romulo," who made at least one trip! “out
of town" from 17 February to 2 April 1969 (possibly
to Guatemala) during the period covered by ROWTON'S
reports, appears to belong to a faction of the
Guatesalan FAR family disillusioned with PBRUMEN.

ce. The only real service asked LIRING-3 by’
“Romulo” during the period under review was to put
up an unidentified “comrade” scheduled to come to
Mexico at a date which "Rosulo" said he could not
determine exactly. This "comrade" was not the young
Guatemalan who dropped in on’ LIRING-3 for a couple
of days mentioned in the report dated 25 April.

‘ dad. LIRING-3 continues to collect clear evidence
i that LIRING has done its best to denounce him as a

i Suspicious element definitely not to be trusted (see
reports dated 15 and 19 February).

3. Several attempts to tail “Romulo” did not . produce
varticularly significant results. A voretext investigation of
apartment 102 of Calle Coahuila, where LIRING-3 met "Romulo!
produced the results contained in the Spanish language report
dated 26 February. forwarded ‘gs attachment #2. There were no
traces on the Ines #BASTON deX*PIMENTEL family. gy.= atiPlener

:L >
4. There is little question at this point that TIRING

is close to persona non grata with LIRING. Hence, his further
usefulness against the PBRUMEN target is very limited.
ROWTON has kept away from LIRING-4 since LIRING-3's release
from prison in Guatemala. Although LIRING-4, following her
father's death (see MEXICO CITY-0125), may visit her mother
in PBRUMEN, she has no particular love for LIRING or the PERUMEN
authorities. On the Guatemalan side of this operation, the
Station is, as it has done many times in the past, waiting for
LIRING-3's Guatemalan contacts to make the next move.

LIRIKG/3 told zowton that there ned ceen littie or no dev2io:szents
since he last saw kowton (21/1/69),just before Howton nad left on
his business trip to Monterrey. He commented *nat he had felt it
wiser not to teke any initiative in seexins out his FAR friends or
revisitins the LIHING office until 3.ston had recurned. Je stated
that his old Guatezralan friencé, Jacoto Rodriruez Padilla,had cailed
ou him once in the company of Carlos Veca, but nothing significant
had emerged from the casual conversation. Vega, at several points
in the conversation, nad mumbled scnething te Zodriguez about the
“erisis" but nieher> gave an explanation. L/3 tcid Rowton that he as-

‘sumed that this romerk referrred to the currest factioneliss in the

Guatemazan revotutionary strurele.
LIRING/3 then identified the attached photo of vari. Aveosto Kendez
Aguilar immediately at ohe first glance as that of "Rénui0” ,»exa "Mario
Mendez" and "Pavel." LIxING/3 dia not recognize the photo 2owton

showed him of Mario Otcniel Mendez hoiina. : :
Guidance/Infornation Given to Agent: | :

Rowton told L/3 that according to the very sketchy inforzation he

had concerning Mario Aucesto Mendez Azuiler it appeared thet the latter
belogged to a stronzly anti-PBRUNEN faction ani that this would perhaps
explain the turn-about of the LIRiGs after he, 1/3, hed indicated to
LIRING/9 that he was in contact with "Pavel." ;

Rowton urged L/3 to seek out "Rémuio™ at the calle Coshuila 221 safe-
house, and, failing this, to recentact Humberto Gonzalez Vega at his
hoze on calle Manzanillo, in the hope taat the iatter gould arrange

a@ recontact with Hendez.

both proceeded to the eiiress given by Riulo end found hiz there in

the sidst of a rather laree number of persons, apparently ef the same
fanily resicing in the arpertnent. after about fifteen minutes. of social
chatter, Rézulo suggested tast they co to a nearby restaurant, to talk
wore privately. Romulo tien toox Ly3 and his wife to the restaurant
kuku at Calle Coahuila 223 where they had dinner. L/3 told Holton taat
because of nis wife's freseace he was not able to discuss anythics sub-
stantive with Honulo and rac to leave the questions te wanted) to ask hin
re PA3/BBRUMEN activites urtil a subsequent neetinz. L/3 added teat in
the course of conversatien, Zomulo stated thet Rodolfo Sandovél Slegria
hoped to be released fron prison in March,19€9. Ronulo also ststed that
he worked in a newspaper office, but L/3 felt he could aot segurely ask
the name of the newspaper at that time. ,

L/3 told Roxton that Rontlo agreed to another seeting on 18 74bruary and

--—-esked L/3 to net him ceain at apartment 102 of Coahuila 200 shortly after

7900, inasmuch as he ceneraliy leaves his place of ezploynent,a little

“I/3 then told sowton that after he ind left Rowton the previouds day he had
another very disturbing exzerience (he appeared to Rowton re TOUS and suf-
fering from lack of sleep}. L/3 explained that when he dro into the
Salén de la Plastica Mexicana about 1300 on 14/2/69, he ran into an bld

U3 corzented to Xeaton that the "aninpeachadle source", must, be the Chief

“aOmuso- c1aQ not vive any exzlenaticn of bis absence since mid-Pebruary
“and L/3 felt he could not ask for suzh expicnation. "Rézulo" prozised
to keep in touch with LIHING/3 by Grocsping in to his apartment “wherever
he could". LINING/3 told Rowton thet he rade a disereet effort te =et
from "Rérulo”" a telephone nucter or eddress throuch whica he could be

Easter weex, but as yet had been x e to cet into his residence,zs he
had hoped. He stressed tnat his reletionship with Iden B “was ine
proving steadily and he felt this a z20d sign, izasmuch as he felt certain
that iden B “would not take the initiativeof recontacting LISING/3
- without prior consultation with ZIRIFG/9 and LIRING/2. ; .
LIRING/3 then told Rowton that LINTUC/4 had received a very pessizistic
letter fro= a certain Echenendfe, 2 uncle residing in Brooklyn, New York,
> -  - who stated that LIRING/4's fether was dving of cancer or the throat and
was unadle to leave his hone. LI8INC/3 continued that he had just dis-
covered that LIRING/4 on her own initiative had rushed! to the U.S. Con-
sulate and requested s visa. As she suzsequently told LIRING/3, LI31}6/4
was inforzed by a consular official that her cese would have to be "in- |
vestigated carefully by JCPACT™ and that she was required to pay 725 pesos .
for a telexram to Washinzton,5.C. to expedite the case. LIRING/3 told
Rowton that he felt LIRING/8's ection had teen precips: ous: and could cause
bin additional embarrassment with the LIRING office..He added that he aia
not think a visa would be sranted, bus asked xowton to, do whatever he

her sick father and the problem this represented for him, when he first
talked to LIAING/9 after ais retuan from Gus-emala. :

LIRXIKC/3 t-1ld Zowtcn that he felt this would also constitute a good pre-
text to sound out LIRIiG/? about his rersoral feelines toward LIRIKG/3
and his own situation in the LIXI1.G Cffice. Rowton suszested that LIRING/3
take this occasion to mention casually that h2 was still in occasional

in Mexico and a suspected PBRUMEN contact. The
Staticn had the LIEWRACE team cover the entrance {
of the building where “E\DEZ and other FAR members |
have an apartment they use for clandestine meetings H
with LIRI'G-3. Despite the fact that the team H
knows LIRING-3 from previous surveillance and that i
“a copy of LIRING-3's sketch of MEND22 was also
provided, the LIEMBRACEs spotted neither man. The
Station naturally plans to cover another meeting |
and is also exploring the possibility of determining;
who rented the arartmest and from whom. It is of ;
some interest to note that MENDEZ, aithough he gave :
LIRING-3 the agreed upon recognition signal, may :
still not be the “Pavel” LIRING-3 was told he would :
meet. LIRING-3 was shown a photograph of Oscar :
(2or- 641539) arturo®$prarz Ramirez (known to have serviced a
letter drop in Mexico City used by Michelle Jeannette
FIRK before her death in Guatemala). LIRING-3 i
thougnt it Icoked like a poor print of a pkotograph |
of “Pavel” shown to kin while still incarcerated.

b. LIBING-3 is apparently still suspicious L

+ = De le acer decd

several letters (see paragraph 2) from members of
the FAR in Guatemala warning him that adverse rumors:
(some of then calling him a WOFIRM agent) have been ‘
circulated in that country by Carlos PERZABAL Marcve.
Knoving that PERZABAL's father-in-law is a close
friend of Chief, LISING, LIRING-3 sourced che rumors.
to the LIRING headman. He first took up the matter |
of the accusations made against him with LIRING-9. -

_ The latter said there was nothing to this, but, and
there was 2 t, LERING-9 reminded LIRING-3 that

|= the past he had been connected "with a person of

mysterious and suspicious affiliations," a clear
reference to ROWTON, LIRING-3's Greek friend. When
LIRING-3 insisted he wanted to discuss the matter
of the allez ons made against his directly with
Chief, LIRING, LIRING-9 rronised to make an appoint-:
ment for him. This appojntzent, however, never :
materialized. That Chie2, LIRING may have spread 1
the allegations made.against LIRING-3 by PERZABAL  {
was confirred by” Rolando*SUAREZ (see ROWION's {

a report dated 31 December). LIRING-3 also took up 1
the matter of the PERZABAL denunciations with MENDEZ,
who told him that the FAR had paid no attention to
them and even accompanied LIRING-3 to PERZABAL's
house. LIRING-3, however, made the mistake of
giving his name when asked who was calling. The
result, as couid be expected, was that PERZABAL was
“not in.” MENDEZ agreed to accompany LIRING-3 to.
LIPING to talk to its Chief, but he warned LIRING-3 |
not to make accusations without proof. MENDEZ,
incidentally, does not appear to be pro-PBRUMEN.
This is interesting in view of the fact that .
CONTRERAS, vith whom he may. be identical, is a |
» suspected contact of the PBRUNEXers.

ce. So far, it does not seen that the FAR has
‘been greatly disturbed by the accusations made
against LIRING-3. In fact, MENDEZ and the two othe
FAR members LIRING-3 net on 1 January’ have urged
LIRING-3 to join them in the hills of Guatemala,

intensified. They did not hide that their purpose
was to broadcast LIRING-3's tame and the fact that

a Mezican had joined their fight. This was ‘apparently
to zppeal to the Mexican left and gain their support.
While LIRING-3 has declared himself ready to go back
to @uatenala (if this was what ROWION wanted him to
do), he did sot need ROWTON to decide that broad-
casting his name from the jungles of Guatemala was
not a thing he wanted anyone to do. At Station -
directive, LIRING-3 pointed out that after his
recent isprisonmeat he had to take care of his wife
before doing any more for the cause. The best way
to d this sas to take LIRING-4 to PERUMEN ind leave
her wiih relatives. This led LIRING-3 to ask what,
if anything, he could do for the FAR in Mexico.

So far, however, his FAR friends have not risen to
the bait.

Subject: LIRInG/3 Report of Contact by *Pavel™ of PAR. :
4, LIRING/3 reported to Rowton et 1000 on 23/12/68 at tne restaurant
in the Camino Real Hotel that at long last the FAR contact premised by
the Le6n Barrios brothers. had appeared, LIZING/3 told Zowton that et about
1900 on 19 December a Guatezalan came to his apartment and intppduced
himself as "a friend of Violeta.” L/3 invited him in but asked him not to
discuss anything sensitive in the presence of his wife. After about ten
minutes of chit chat in the spartrent, 1/3 end the Custemalan, who gave
his name sizply as "Rémulo", went to a nearby restaurant to talk privately.

2. According to LIRIKG/3, the Guatemalan stated that he kad been ordered
by FAR to maintain contact with 1/3. When queried by L/3 regarding the
Humberto Gonz&lez Vega whom he had met vreviauely, "Dienta® oeotnsnr3,
"Oh, you mean ‘£1 Gato’ - he's a good element, but he will not beim your
FAR contact. I have been entrusted with that mission.” "Rémulo"™ aiso stazed
that he knew Francisco Lera well and had worxed with hin in Guatemala City
seme time ago until Lara was arrested. "Rémulo" added that unfortunately
Lara's mother hed betrayed him to the police and he barely escaped arrest
at that time. "K6mulo” confirmed that Lara had been under a cloud as far
as bis superiors were concerned and had cade the ili-feted trip

in order to attempt to clear himself of charzes against him. :

3. when LIRING/3 told "Rémulo” that ke had been in touch with the LIRING
office since his return, the latter exclsined,"But what nave the LIkiscG
people to do with us?“ This gave L/3 the definite impressicn that "Rézulo“
binself was not in touch with a PBEUMEN representative in Mexico city,and,
in any case, didnot like the LIRIXC esta>lisoment. +

&,. He then asked L/3 to cive him a summary report of the arrest and detention,
L/3 told Rowton that he balked at this at first, protesting to "Z6malo” that
he had already given the details to the Leén Barrios brcthers and"Cebollito"
who he was sure had passed on the report to the FAR in Guatemala. “shen
"Rémulo" explained that he would aspreciate en oral report on the spot since

“he was not fully informed beceuse of communications prevlezs, LIRIEG/3 told
Rowton that he went over the whole episode for "Rémulo's" benefit. "Rémulo®

then asked to see LIRIiNG/3 again at’ 1100 on 21 December to continue ‘their

Giscussion. He promised to-neet L/3 on the. street in front of his apartment
house at the appointed time. - ; i i .
5. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that auch to his surptrise and/ indignatica ;

2.

of the Le6n Zarrios brothers, in which,emong other thines, she stated that
“the man on the bicycle", which L/3 explained to Howton meant Carlos
Persabal hed written a letter containing grave charges
against LIRING/3. The letter, which 1/3 read aloud to Rowton, went an to

' assure L/3 that these charges were not believed but constituted a source
of annoyance to tne writer's friends. :

6. LIRING/3 continued to Rowtcn that he felt so indignant and shock<i at

. this unpleasant development tnat he deciced to see the Chief LIKING and
: have it at with him. L/3 explained that since the Chief LIRING is on very
5 friendly terms with the father-in-law of Persabai he might be aware of the
letter and even possibly erccurgaged Fersabal to write it. L/3 told Kowton
that he then got in touch with LIaING/2 by telephone andimade ‘a date to meet
pim at the LIKING esteablishzent at 0930 on 21/12/68. when he arrived st the
j gate at thet time he was told that LIRZING/2 nad not yet arriveed. After a wait
of some twenty minutes, LIRING/2 appeared but asked LIZING/3 to wait a little
. longer since he was very busy. After another annoyixg wait, LIRING/S appeared
instead of LIRING/2 and talked with LIZING/3 on the patio. LIRING/3 explained
‘that he wanted ursently to talk with the Chief LIRINS siice something bad
come up with regard to Persetal. He reminded LIRING/9 that he orisinelly bag
exppresseé a desire to have a face-to-fece cenfrontaticn with Fersabal in
tbhe LIKING office so that he could present his report on ‘the arrest in his
presence. LIRInG/9, according to LIATéG/3, brushed this off again with the
comment, "But as I told you before, you're making a mountain of a colehill.
You're exaggerating the whole business.”

9. LIRIKG/3 tole Rowton that he then took out Martha's letter and insisted

: that LIRING/9 read it. The latter expressed amazement at ‘the revelation of | -

- Persabal's action but did not agree with LIRING/3 that the Chief LIEIXG :
would be able to shed light on it. LIRING/3 then told LIRING/9 that he did .
not like the games that everycne seemed to be playing with him, and asked
LIRING/O point baank what it was thet zotivated hin to ask for a written

_ report of the arr:st and,after L/3 cozplied with the request, to grap bis
feet. L/3 continued that he felt he hed been frank with the LIRIKG office,
whereas on the other hand they were not honest with bin telling him what
they thought of him. L/9 then assured L/3 of his confidence inbim and added
that in the past certain persons, including Hugo, the assistant to LIRLiG/11,
had felt thatLIxinc/3 had been connected with a person of| mysterious and
suspicious affiliationa.! 1L/3, understarding this to be a clear ‘allusion to
Rowton, admitted to having known this person in the past ee having hed

-a few business transac-ions with him, including the sale of « nuaber of

his paintings, but insisted with soze annoyance that this bad sok bearing
on hig political activity. LIZINS/9 acreed and aaced that it was really a
thing of the past that should not bother LIZIHG/3. He promised to make an
appointment for LIRING/3 to see the Chief LIRING soxcetime tae following week.

B. IIginG/3 continued that when ke met with "R6mulo* later that morning he
also showed the letter froz Martze to Lin. Accordins to 1/3, ;"Rémulo" becane
indignant and suczested thet they talk to Fersabal tocether to get to the
bottom of the matter. L/3 and "Zimulo" then took a taxi to the residence of
Persabdal in the hope of finding aim in at the time. when 3; Rowever, range

in apartment 12 in the company of two other persons, previously unknown
to LIRING/3. Both mppeared younzer than "s5zulo” and one could easily be

tke old penitentiary in Guatemala City and subsequently "thrown" over the

the proposed travel of L/3 to Guatemala in the cozpany of his: rew FAR

LIRING/3 asreed sri said that he felt he would have to continue to stall,
even et the risk of alienatirg the affections and confidence of his new

Subdject: LIRING/3 Report of Allecaticn of UCPIX¥ Affiliation.

4. At 1000 on 7 January,1969, at the restaurant of the Casino Real Hotel
LIRING/3 reported to Howton taat be had lust received three letters fron
Kerta Barrics de Leén, the mother of tne Leén Parrios orethera (Miguel

and Ju&n) whom he had orisinally set during bis confinement in Guatemala
City. ce gave the original letters, xowton's translztion of waich is
attached, to Rowton to copy and study. LIainc/3 appeared genuinely shaken
at the revlaticn in the second parssraph of the letter,dated! 23/12/68,
that the "man cn the bicycle” ( Carlos Perzabal) had written! in bis letter

to Marta that LIgING/3 was "working Zor another cozpany (4CPIEM) und that
Merte chant’ nat aanfide in envthive LISTHG/2 mtcht write tal hana TATA SA

: told Rowton that ne bad suspected chat Perzabal bad accused his of perhaps
‘ causing the arrest, but he never dcreaned that Ferzabal would! go so far as
: to accuse Liz outright of being a SC 7I#M gzent. :

2. LIRING/3 then speculated tuat Ferzadal could not have done such a serids
: thine of his own initiative, but cust necessarily have been inspired by
: soze outside source, most probably the LIRING establisiment. He continued
that he therefore felt it rore necessary than ever to put the LIRIbG Chief
"up asainst the wall" end force. bis to adrit nis complicity.) £IRz%G/3 added ©
that he hed seen "Rémulo* on 3 Jax cary as plerned and had told him about
the letter from Marta and Terzsabai's treachery. According tol LIRIHG/3
"Rémulo” became indignant and volunteered to accorpany LIkI: [6/3 to the
LIRING establisament to have the «iole thing out once and for all. LIxI:G/3
appeared so cisturbed at the unexpected news that Rowton found it impossible
---- -to check with him on the exect tire and place he allegedly met *Rémulo” on
Priday, 3/1/69. when Rowton stated that he felt it very inpertant to iden-
tify "Rémulo” positivéely ( Rowton alleged that he had access to the Gober-
nacién "mug file" of persons wanted by the Guatemalan Government and given
to the Mexicans for identificaticn}), LIRING/3 volunteered to arrange to
meet "R6mulo” somewhere in public as soon es possible so that zoston could
get a good look at him ( as he had srefiously done in the case of "Garcia").
3. Rowton advised LIRING/3 @@6 not uncer any circumstances tlo attempt to
lure "Rémulo” to any public place, especially since the latter had estab-
lished a pattern of meeting with him in a safehouse, but simpiy te tell
Rowton the next time he was invited to visit tae safehouse dnd kowton sould .
cover the place from as conveniext a’ spot as possible (e.¢. éoolworkd's

Some Interest te note that ua¥D2Z, although ke gave
LIRING-3 the ameed upon recomitics simal, aay
still ant be the "Pavel" LIZIN3-3 was told he would
weet. LURING-3 vas shovn a photozranh of cecar

=. Gassanu-s te apparently still susvicieus
in the eyon of the PREUME ers. Ze has received
several lettera (see parazravh 2} from weabera of

the FAN in Guatemale warning him that adverse rumors |

(seme of then calling him a ¥CPIAM agent) have been

circulated in that country by Carloa PERZABAL Harcus.!

Enoving that D:RZARAL's father-in-law is 2 close
ariend of Chief, LIKING, LIZING-3 sourced the rusors
to the LIRING beadman. ce first toox up the ratter
of the sccusatione sade against Bie eith LIRING-3.
The lattes said there vas nothing to this, but, and
there wes a but, LIAIHG-8 rewinded LIXING-3 that |
in the veet he bad been connected “vith 2 carson of
wysterious and susoicious affiliations,” a clear
reference to 2GVTON, LIRING-3's Greek feicsd. Yhea
LISING-3 iasistes be wanted to discuss the eatter

of the alizzaticas made arainst hia directly with
Chief, LIQING, LIRI4G-# proziged to make an anpoint-
went for hin. This appointmest, however, never
Baterialized, That Chief, LIRI¥G aay have soread
the allozations nadie against LIRINS-3 by PZRZABAL ”
Was Confirmed by Rolando SSUAK= (see RCKTON’s
Feport dated 31 December}. LIRIIG-3 algo took uo
the matter of the PiXzAPAL cenunciations vith MENDEZ,
who told his that the FAR had vaid no attention to
them and even accompanied L1R15G-3 to PidZABAL'S
houne. LIAING-3, bovwever, sate the sistake of
giving bis namo whea asked who vas calling. The .
result, as could be expected, waz that PIAZABAL vas
“pot in.” MiNDES agreed to accomvany L1Zi%3-3 to
LIBING to talk to its Chief, but he warned LIBiN3-3
net to make accusations without proof. WENDKZ,
incidentally, does aot apnear to be nro-PLAUASS.

Thie is interesting. in view of the fact that:

CONTR CHAZ, with whoe be may be identical, is a
suspected contact of the PaaUusvers.

Cc. So far, it 400s not seen that the FAR has
been greatly iisturbed by the accusations nade :
against LIRING-3, In fact, sii aad the tso other
FAR members LIHINS-3 set on 1 January have urzod

D. LIALENANAC-1: 0 LIALMANAC~1 told ROTTOx oa
23 Novercber that he is a close, long-tirne fricud of
the Subject of H3iA-26016. He says new he believes
he can develsp" a close relationship with QU BOON,

The son arrived in Mexico on 2 December, but it has
not yet been determined whether he is willing to;
be contacted and, hopefully, debricfed.

4. -Legal Travelers to PBRUMEN: ‘ ‘

t

A. LIRING-4: According to LIRING-3, LIEING-4
is in no condition to accept any assignment or
instructions for a trip to PBRUMEN. There is,
however, sone possibility that LIRING-3 nay go to
PBRUHEX on a “cultural” mission, at which time he
will report directly to PBRUHNEN officials on his
activities in Guatenala. LIRING-9 has reiterzted
that he wants both LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 toizo. but
has not suggesved gates tor this travel. (See
MEXICO CITY-8159 and ~-8225.) .

B. LIRENO-2: LIRENO-2's papers are finally.
in order, and she has indicated that she is still +
willing to travel to PPRUMEN. However, the.recent
death of her nother, as well as the recent incar-
ceration of her son (in a frame-up by his erployer -
see HESICO C1TY-8182), has brought her to a ptysical
and psychological low. The Station is allowing her
time to recuperate before raising the question again. |

C. LIANELE-1: LIANKLE-1 has not yet bettlea |
in Mexico City. There was no contact with her .
during this period. i

D. \WLIARW-1: Per MEXICO CITY-7433, Lrbse-a
was met during the Olympics, but did not have access
to much information of value. (See WEXICO CITi~7563
and ~7741.) In spite of the fact that he was in |
daily contact with PBRUNEN participants, some cf whonu
" spent considerable tine with hin, he came up with
virtually nothing. The Station, at present; has no
contact with LIARM-1, who has returned to the
- Monterrey area. |

E. Subject of MEXICO CITY-5853 (News contact
of LITAMIL-3): Subject has becn reapproached about.
making a trip to PBRUNEN now that the Olympics are

G. Subject of Wi1-3551€: The Station is |
still planning to Lave ROWTON explore the feasibility
of approzching Subject and using hin as aa evertual
source in FERUNEA, where, by the nature ef his >
function, he stiil maintains contacts. (See Mau-
35516.) -

t t
H. AMSTRUT-16: Subject traveled to POnUney

on 18 October 1948 and returned on 1 Nevernbder. On

SLOYAN, who caxe to Mexico on TDY for this purgeose,.

The results of this debriefing were received in

UFAA-355.

I. Subject of MEXICO CiTy-8319: LIfAwIL-3;
was contacted by Subject, who returned from PESUuEN
on 2 Tecexver. Subject was debriefed by a Station
Case Officer on the current status of the re lation-
ship between his organization and the PSRUNEy :
Governuent, and on other requirements given hin

' before his depzriure for PBRUNEN. The most pronising
i factor in this oseration is the fact tbat feur of
hic aulmerdinetac will he ening mt for 2 ennferance
in April 1969. Subject promised to give the Station
access to any or aii of these individuals.

5. Technical Penetration and Coverage of LIRING and the
Residences of LIRING Personnel:

A. METRAP in Chief, LIRING's Residence: |
MEXICO CITY-7982 reported on the difficulties
encountered in trying to have a LIRISK unit installed
in the LIHACK-4 LD. The Station made its own LIRISK
installation on 23 November. (See MEXICO CITY-8182.)
All attempts to activate the \KTRAP have so far ;
been unsuccessful. (See MEXICO CITY-8303.) i
t

R, LISAYDSY: LISAMPAN coverage of BAKER
continued. EASY w2s lost on 9 October 2s a result
of a routine installation in the same building by
the LIRISK cozpany. Attempts to activate EASY fron
LISARI were umsuccessful. (See MEXICO C17Tx-7593; and
-8232.) \

C. LIENVOY: LIENVOY coverage has renained
unchanged. The LIRING Commercial line still has
not been reconnected. {

D. ULIFEAT: -LIFEAT coverage of LIRING-21 was
discontinucd on 15 xovember for security rezsoms.
The coverage was renewed on 6 December. | ert

" EB. LIONION: LIONION-1 continued to perform
his photographic and audio duties. His ability pow
to identify people by name by monitoring DOG is}
particularly useful. -

5

F. LIROSIN: LIROSIN-1 was kept on full salary |
during the period. In late November he was giv :
the assignuent of renting a new LP shich vas szatted!
by LITALNT-2. He successfully rented this LP
4 Decerber, after LIRENO-1 laid the grouncwork, jand’.
will move into it oa 18 Decerber 1968.. This will |
be the base for an audio operation against. LIRING-2,

G. Trash Operatica: The trash operation was
not reictitated during this period. i

:
H. Audio Against the Residences of LIRING-21
and LIRING-24: Via LIPESLN-1 the Station located
empty apartments in the same buildings there these
two LIRING officers live. Atterpts to rent at least
one of these for an audio operation proved difficult
in yier of the need for a cosigner and finding
suitable people to move in. LIROSIN-} was' goi:g to
attezpt to nzke some arrangement shen the LP described
iu subparagraph 5F turned up. The Station’ decided
the lattes was of higher priority and discontinued
its efforts to rent the apartments next to LIRING-21
and LINING-24.

6. Physic2l Penetration and Coverage of LIRING:

A. PBZRUEMEY Deputy in Merida: This target
left PCS on 15 November 1968. (See MECICO CITY-8148.)

period. ;

i

D. ‘LIRING-3/LIRI® “G-4: On 29 October ROSTON
net LIRING-3 after his release from jail. The
results of the initial debriefing were cabied in
MEXICO CITY-7900. LIRING-3 indicated that LIRING-4
was very nervous and upset, and that he wanted all
his on activity and associaticn with ROWTON to be
kept from her. LIRING-3 has been mecting fairly
frequently with LIRING-9, who has been debriefing
him oz his encarceration in Guatemala. (See MEXICO
CITY-8159 and -8228.)

E. PBRUMEN Maids: The Station decided to
mount an operation against the PSRUMEN maids, and
selected LIEVBRACE-3 as a suitable access agent.
(See MECICO CITY-7861.) The Station is in the
process of turning LIENBRA4CE-3 over to LIREALW-1,
who will be the outside Case Officer on this

operation. (See alse MEXICO CITY-8124.)

F. Chief, LIRING: The Station has corresponded
‘with Headquarters about a false flag cold: approach
- against Chief, LIRING. This still is in the ex-
ploratory stages. (See MEXICO CITY-8242.)

"| %. Harassment of LIRING: ‘ There were no new fiuarache
leaflets put out during this period.

“. 8. LICOMED Debriefing Center: MEXICO crry-8066 reported
that the charitable sponsorship covering the overt activities
of the debriefing certer ended on 31 October 1968 and that the
extra financial cover for the office space would end 30 November.

problem. (See also MEXICO-CITY--8179 and ~8287.) HMMA-35887

10. Double Agents: LISASSY-1 returned from! his ipuropean
trip on 17 Soveuber and was recontacted by LIRING-9, wre
levied reguircements on him as reported in NEXICO CITY-8339. -
LISASSY-1 continues to have difficulty satisfying LIRING-®
requests for information on the activities of the: PBRUMEN
community in licxice City and wia.i. The CI aspect of the
LISASSY~-1 operation ¥as virtually at a standstill, for two
reasons: first, at one time or another, either LIRING-9 or
LISASSY-1 was out of Mexico; and second, the Station has beer
unable tv cone up with information which LISASSY~-1 could pass

received a letter frou Guatemala which he interpreted
as a check on a new conmo channel between the
Guatemalan rebels and him. LIRING-3 reported at
“length to LIRING-9 on his contacts with FAR nezbers
while in jail. At LIRING-S's suggestion, LIRING-9
may send LIRING-3 to PBRUXEY to make a persofal
report on this. (See MEXICO CITY-8159.) Sore
detailed reports were forwarded in HuYA-35905.
HMMA-35004 forwarded a xeport of LIRiNG-3's imprison-
ment in Guatemala. :

B. Letter Drops: The PBRUMEN letter déops
being covered by the Station only produced one
interesting letter during tais period. (See: HMMA-
35873.) The Statica suggested that Headquarters
follow up on the lead provided.

C. LIRING-7: LIRING-7 continued to see his
Mexican leftist student "friends" during this period.

He was asked to take a walkie-type radio intq jail:
for their conmo, and was asked if he would bd willing
to assist them with his hax radio equipment for

since going through LIRING vas not satisfactory.

The Station is taking a wait-and-see attitud¢ to see
how this develops. (Sce MEXICO CITY-8213.) pe oe RO

by ROWTON, dated 28 November 1968, which the Station somehow
failed to forward. | }

2. That LIRiNG has forwarded information to the Mexicar-
Communist Party casting suspicion on LIRING-3's past activities
did not come as a great shock. Heraclio ZEPEDA is known to
the Station as a previous teacher at the University of Jalapa
who said in 1960 that he would accept a teaching position ia
PBRUMEN, a country he has visited on several occasions at the
invitation of its government. ZEPEDA aiso spent some time

in 1965 in the U.S.S.R., where he was described as Foreign
Correspondent of La Voz de Yexico, an official organ! of the
Mexican Communist Party (see HSAIA-27727, 24 November! 1965),
ZEPEDA apparently also visited Comsunist China. He appears
to be well acquainted with LIRING-9. In view of the! above,
the Station instructed ROBTON to ask LIRING-3 to refrain from
attempting to use ZEPEDA to obtain a "bootleg" copy of the
LIRING letter to the Mexican Communist Party. Tne Station
feels a copy of this letter would add little to the known fact
that LIRING-3 is a person that LIRING continues to view as
“suspect.” LIONHEART has been asked for up-to-date inrorma~
tion on ZEPEDA's Party position. Any information passed by
LIONHEART will be forwarded to Headquarters. ’

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Méeting with LIHINS/9.

4. LIRING/3 reported to Kowton at 0915 on 27/11/é5 that he had met with
LIxINg/9 at the LIRING establishment fren about 4745 until 1900 on 26/11/68.

He stated that he gave LIKING/9 his written report on his recent experiences

in Guatemala and the conclusions be drew from talking with PAR megbers there.
L/3 also stated that he did his best to assure L/% that, aithough he sympatnized
with the laments of the Leén Earrios brothers, te was really on the PBRUMEN -
side and offered to do all he could to assist the-IhINGs in their attempts to
assist the revolutionary forces. The following is Rowton's reconstruction of

the conversation, based on LIZING/3's report:

. L/3:."°I'm sorry to be late, but I bad to finish the report."
L/9: "Alright. I've been waiting here at the gate so there wouldn't
be any furtner delay. Let's go to my office 80 we cen 2 talic pri-

Upon entering office, 1/9 removes jacket anc offers 1/3 a Seat in the
office. :
L/3: "Well, here's my resort. I must apologize that it's in rough draft
form. I had to write it rather hurriedly when my tife was not around.
It's really just ea series of badly organized thoughts and ideas but
I'll be glad to explain. There's a great deal more, of course, that
I could explain on the subject. Do you wish me to read it??
- L/9: "Ko, that's alright. i
L/9 glences through the report and continues:
"I'll read it carefully later. I really didn't expect such a long
report. I appreciate it. In the meantine, how are you doing in your
personal affairs??
L/3: “well, as I told you last time, I'm very zuch up in tae ajr at. the

‘your Chief. in any case, it's over now, and I doen't expect any trouble
froz that quarter. However, I feel that I should explain that # have

41. Rowton met with LIaING/3 at the Camino Real Zestauratt at 1000 on
40 and 13 January. Se reported the following developments in iconnection

with the accusatiozs made against biz to Harta Barrios de Leén by
Identity A ‘ i

(a) On the evening of & January,1969, Identity B
- - called on tim at his home unannounced and rade an effort to .
sooth over the hard feelinczs that h2d arisen tetween LIKIKG/3
and her husdand. She denied any knowledge of charges made by
luca Lumovond aguiust 475 ana Ciaimec tast she could not believe
them in any case. when L/3 stated that he had definite proof:
in the forz ef a letter Identity B insisted on seeing it.
I/3 (who bad civen the original letter to Rorton) stalled pro~
mising to sroduce the letter on 10 January ir the presence of her
husband. 1/3 told Rowton that when he atterpted to contact Iden B
and her husband by phone on the morning of 10 darnuary, be found
the phone constantly busy and suspects that the receiver was
left purposely off the hcok. . :
(>) On the evering of 12 January,1969, Arturo Serraro of the CPM,
visited 112I:G/3 at his hore and tole bim that the Central Con-
mittee of the CPM had discussed his feud with Identity A. ,
in response. to the letter LIRING/3 had sent to it alleging that
Iden A was malicning him unjuetly. Serrano continued that the
CC of the CFM had found the letter too vague to nak® any sense,
but in any case could not take Iden A seriously. Serrano told
L/3 that Iden A and = Identity B .had been recently formally
expelled froz the party for ideologicel reasons, but still had a
number of friends willing te voueh for them. On tae! other hand
Serrano stated that the CC of the Crm had receivec information
"some tine avo" from the LiginG office alleging that LIRING/3 had
veen acting in a suspicious manner, eSp2cially with) regard to cer-
tain infornation he had provided concerning Julian Lépes that
“could not tave come from a scurcse other than the police." Serrano

Subject: LIRING/2 Report of Address of Guatezelan Refugees in
Mexico City. |

1. At 4000 on 21/1/69 LiaiiG/3 told Rowton thet his old en
friend Jacobo Rodrfauez Padills was residing at Calle Verscruz 14,
apartment, and that the Carlos Vege,snom Jacobo sad sent to’ LIRING/3's
home with a note askine 1/3 to help Vega, was living in the azotea
(servant's) room belonging to Jacobo's apartzent.

2. L/3 also reported that Carlos Vera again celled on hin unar: ounced
at hia anartment on 20 Januarv.and asked him to arrenze tarourh bis
PBRUMEN friends to send a puckage of medicine to a son of ‘turcios

who was living in the PS5RUMEN capital. Vega alsc asked i/3 to send
two "very inmportant"™ letters to PSRI¢=ZN throusk friends who could
bypess the usual censorship. L/3 promised to io what he could and asked
Vega to deliver tne letters tohia on 25 January.

3. Because of the obvious possibility of provecetion in this rather
unexplained benavior of Carlos Vega ( he originally told 1/3 that te
was a close friend of Identity A ), Rowton azreed with !L/3 thet
no attempt should be made to open the letters ari shat they sbould
be delivered ;rozptly to the LIKING office for waatever dispositicn
that estabiishment might wnat to make of the letters. L/3 proaised

to note carefully the addressees of the letters. |
4. Fowton tcld 1/3 that he would have to leave town for a visit to

Monterrey and was not certain when he would be able to finish his
business there. He made at date, however, for 1000, 3 February,at
the Camino keal restaurant,and asked 1/3 to return to the daze place
at 1000 on 7 February in the event that Rowton did not appyar at the
first tine and date. ee

Serrano,as a friend, advised L/3 to "take the bull by the

horns” ana send 22 much data as cossitle to éefend himself

to all “icpertant progressive” orgenizations. He volunteered

to pass a ccpy of the letter from Marta 2arrios te the CEM and
L/3's version of the arrest and detention as scon as he had pre-
pared it.

<2. In response to Rowton's query as to any other friends /3 might have
fi in the CFM who misnt be able to obtain a copy of the origi:al letter from

2, the LIRTMWG Cffice, LIRING/3 recalled thet an old acquaintence from Chiapas,
$ :

Borcolic Wopras, Lud iecemssy duvaveu cim to aimner ana appeared anxious to

eel
re-estadiisno contact with hin. I/3 told Rowton that he had xnown Zepeda

in the P3RUMIN capital sore six years previously and recalled that Zepeda
had traveled and studied in Cozmunist China and the Soviet Union before re-
turing to Mexicc. Zepeda recently told 1/3 that he was exployed in CCNASUPO
and that he had written several articles favorable to 1/3 in: "Henovacién”

a daily newspaper ne controlled in Tuxla-Gutierrez,Chiepas. L/3 told Rowton
taat he later learned thatthe newspaper was actually owned by Hank Gonzdlez,
general director of CONASLEPO, who apparently had political aubitions.

. i
3. donton suggested that L/3 get in totch with Zepeda net only to deterzine

why he nad recontacted i/3 after so long a time, but to ascertain bis curreat

relationship with the CPH and the LIRING office, if any.

A. LIRING/3 stated that he hed not been recontactea by *"Résulo" and pronised
to advise Rowton in advance of a future meeting sc that Zowton could cover
it in the hope of getting a good look at the Fak representative.
