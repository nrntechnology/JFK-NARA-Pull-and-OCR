(7) Sergio Totlon, Code clerk in the Enbassy in

Ambassador Carrillo.

1. Gastro enteritis, water pollution and unsanitary

conditions, AMLASH-1 states there are no real problems,

although the scarcity and lack of a balanced dtet do
cause some problems. The purificetion of water has been

a problem which probably has been the cause of some of the

sickness in the country.

m, AMLASH-1 did not believe that Aragones had invited

im to fly back to Havana with him in order to get bin
ack because of any serious security mattor. AMIASH-1

did state that Aragones was concerned that AMLASH-1 may not

return to Cuba. Since Aragones cleared AMLASH-) for his

trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH-1 does

not defect and returns to Cuba. AMLASH-1 feele Aragones
does not want any problems with Fidel in case AMLASH~1

decides to stay out.

n. AMLASH-1 was unable to provide any information on

the political developments tn Cuba in mid-November and

Decenber since he had been out of the country sfnce early

mself to the economic field and plays
He is serious
ding to AMLASH-1,
who has worked seven days a week without leave since the
revolution. Emilito Aragones holds an important position
as the organizational secretary of the PURS. He is the
official who was always at the affice of the National
Directorate of tho Party and has contact with all the
officials in the regime. He plays an important coordinating
role, Faure Chomou has been accused of organizing former
13th of March Revolutionary Directorate people, but,
according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that
Chomon always gives jobs in the ministry he heads to DR
people, Because of this Chomon today controls to a large
degree the Ministry of Transportation. Of all the ministries,
the DR's stronghold is in tho Ministry of Transportation.
Other DR people who continue to hold important positions
in the regime are Alberto Mora, Ambassador Carrillo and

Jose Naranjo.

AMLASH-1 and AMWHIP-1 were unable to develop any
specifics, but from their conversations with Ambassador
Carrillo got the impression that Carrillo would prefer and
welcome a transfer from the Embassy in Paris to the

Embassy ip Madrid.
