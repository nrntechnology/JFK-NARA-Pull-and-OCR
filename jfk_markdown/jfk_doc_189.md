(im August 1951 the Agency ves interested in contacting Professor Of ,

Eéouara POLDINI, ® geophysicist and professor st the University of .

In March 1953 the SCHLUMBERGER file reflects that an FBI source
furnished information that. one Maurice Henri MARTIN, employed as an -
enginear by the SCHLUMBERGER Company, Paris, France, received a letter
éated 27 July 1951 at Moscow from one SiegPied Gtefanovitch MOROSOFF,
asking MARTIN for specialized information concerning geophysics. The ;
letter requested that MARTIN's reply be forwarded to Moscow through an inter-

mediary. From January 1932 until April 1937 MARTIN represented the SCHLUMBERGER

Company in Russia as an engineer, and it was thought that the correspondence
from MOROSOFF may represent a Soviet attempt to resume contact with MARTIN
and Gevelop clandestine relations with him. The FBI conducted an investi«
gation dated Jime 1953 and determined that Maurice Henri MARTIN resided

at Nod Hill, Wilton, Connecticut end was employed by the SCHLUMBERGER

Well Surveying Co., Ridgefield, Connecticut. Informants advised that
eithough MARTIN was strongly nationalistic toward France, he pave every
4ndication of being anti-Russian and there was no evidenced? CP activities.
