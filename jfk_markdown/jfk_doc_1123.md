requested. The furnished list of possible retaliatory
actions by the Castro government were of "the level of
intensity which the committee agreed to be in the most
likely category." It is inferred that what the committee
had in mind by the most likely "level of intensity"
was that level which would not provoke the United States
into taking extensive countermeasures which might seriously
endanger the Castro regime. The summaries of actions
set forth above, which might be taken under existing
military contingency plans are essentially defensive

than risk direct confrontation with the United States. © In
the long run, such action is more dangerous and difficult
to combat, and in the short run is less idkely to provoke

immediate and effective United States retaliation. Such

actions would be in keeping with Castro's repeated declara-
tions that Cuba is the main source of guidance inspiration
for the "inevitable" Latin American revolution. Whereas an
inflamed American public opinion over the killing of even a
few sentries. might require strong countermeasures, the
training of a greater number of Latin American guerrillas
than the 1500 or more trained in fiscal year 1962, probably

would not. Nor is it likely that the reburn of those trainees

to Latin American countries, their establishment of guerrilla
training bases, reeruitment of additional personnel, and
engagement in insurgency actions would be as immediately
provocative as interference with the water supply at Guantanamo.
Similarly, closing access to the naval base Cuban workers who
commute would deprive Castro of a souree of foreign exchange,
While such items as, ‘the harassment of air traffic into and out
of Guantanamo," or "the harassment of US aireraft operating in
the vicinity of or overflying Cuba," might be added to the list,
it is considered that specific provocative actions are less
likely and less dangerous than the intensification of support
to subversive forces in Latin America. Such action not only

is in keeping with the declared communist intention to support
“national liberation movements of oppressed peoples" but may

be done by means which avoid an invitation to overt Us military
countermeasures which would endanger the Castro régime. Thus,
they are considered as of that level of intensity which places.
them in the most likely category as well as being inthe
category of most dangerous to the long range interests of the
United States.
