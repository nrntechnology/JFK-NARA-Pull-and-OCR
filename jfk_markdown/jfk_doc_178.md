1. Per our conversation in the environs of the. DD/P's
office on 19 December, we have just received from {London|Sta-

the(British] Security Service, has provided the following in
a report on Americans who are in correspondence with the
Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation:

"Jim Garrison, District Attorney, Orleans,
Louisiana

A secret and reliable source has reported that the
Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation has been in touch
: with Jim Garrison. Our source states that the ini-
Pee tiative in this contact appears to have come from
— the Foundation and the purpose of it seems to be to
persuade Garrison to write an article about the
late President Kennedy's assassination which pre-
sumably the Foundation could use in some way."
