29 March. This was precipitated by AMTRUNK/3 who called AMICE/14 !
the Cuban term for a. homosexual, the ultimate insult to a Cuban.

I. STATUS REPORT ON TRAINING AND PROCESSING, 4-31 MARCH,
A

_ The AMTRUNK Team, consisting of AMICE/27, AMICE/14, AMTRUNK/2,
‘and AMTRUNK/3 were safehoused on 4 March 1963 at Safesite #164
on Plantation Key.. Andrew 8. PARMERS, KUROAR instructor from
headquarters, was already at the training site when the team
was brought there by the two case officers, Irving N. PEGGINS
and Hobart J. VANDEBORN. PARMERS remained at’ the safesite
until 16 March during which time he conducted training in
clandestine. methods and techniques. This training included
security, cover and compartmentation, clandestine communica-
tions, agent spotting, selection, recruitment and Management,
and operational planning and reporting. The training included -
group discussion and participation in a series of ‘appropriate
operational situations, several problems, and daily physical
training. During this two:week period, either PEGGINS or
VANDEBORN visited the safesite every day, spending an average
of ‘two or three hours with the group in operational dis-
cussions and processing. During the week of 18 thru 23 March,
‘both case officers spent a majority of the time with the group,
‘debriefing them in detail on their operational contacts, workin
out operational details of their infiltration, and continuing
their training on an informal basis. The week of 25 through

. , 80 March was spent in PM-type training with emphasis on compass

i : co -and map reading, including two night problems, and on weapons

! : familiarization and firing. During the period under dis-

” cussion the AMTRUNK group were all LCFLUTTERED, were assessed

by the KUROAR assessment team, were given an initial series
of immunizations, were issued clothing, were processed for
. alias documentation, were processed for disguises, and were
further processed on cover and finance problems, The re-
sults of the LCFLUTTER examinations were sent to headquarters
under cover of UFGA-8111, on 13 March 1963. Based on DIR
26430, no further LCFLUTTER is planned at the present time.

mission 1s etermine’ the climate prevailing among the

populace in Havana for organizing resistance elements capable
of either passive or active sabotage. This secondary mission
is exploratory in nature only, through the first phases of
. the project. In order to accomplish the foregoing missions,
.  ,the operation has been split into two initial’ phases, which -
' will.be compartmented from each other. qlee One involves
- the black infiltration of AMTRUNK/2 and 3 on @ north coast
of Havana province. These two individuals plan to go into

Havana for a period of approximately two weeks, and then
exfiltrate black from the same point at which they infiltrated.

Havana for a period of several weeks and then exfiltrate black.

These two Phases are’ discussed in detail in, following para-

figures in Havana. The following paragraphs discussing these

phases are not designed to be operational plans. Detailed
operational plans for each phase will be forwarded as de-

years, an n some degree experienced in clandestine opera-
tions. He attended (CC Catholic Social dpiversity in Havana for
_ two years, majoring in Social Studies’. Prior to Fidel's

' takeover. A/2 was allied to student elements of the Partido
Autentico which upheld the constitution of 1940. He supported
the revolution against Batista till it became apparent that
Castro had cast his lot for a Communist regime. During his
university years from 1959 to 1961 he was actively engaged
in supporting anti-Castro groups with weapons and materials.
Following the Playa Giron invasiondé great many in the Havana
underground were rolled up but A/2 avoided compromise. He

conta nued a this work through 1961 and finally abt hubs,
ia2 in January/ 1962, Although A/2_ does not consider
aL he has been cooperative throughout
“He-is a pensive individual who displays good
- - judgement. His present attitude “towards KUBARK appears to
; be one ‘of “wait and see". In the meanwhile, he is con-
“seientiously applying himself in preparation for his mission.

In late 1960 he sided with the counter-revolutionaries and
began full time anti-Castro activities. After the crack

and continued to engage in underground activities. Finally
when the, ituation became hopeless he left Cuba by air for

infiltration. This arrangment, as yet, is not definite.

3. “The exfiltration of A/2 is tentatively planned for 31
May -1963 at Punta La Jijira or Puerto Escondido. A/3 feels

A/2 will. be issued documentation claiming he is an employee

of a local brewery in-Havana. A/3 on the other hand will be
issued documentation as a bus driver within the city of Havana.

Both will, also be issued drivers licenses and additional
‘items such as immunization certificates, Cuban receipts, etc.

' The two men will also be outfitted with disguises.

2. Communications

Primary communications will be established through an SW
system, Both men will be given SW instruction and will be
issued accommodation addresses in Miami. This instruction

and these addresses in turn will be passed on to the recruited
.assets in PBRUMEN for use as the operation develops. Pre-
arranged signals will also be devised for use by the team via
. telegram to indicate their progress and confirm their place :
and time of exfiltration. Both members will also be given an
OWVL system to provide them with quick instructions in case

of an emergency. ce

OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION
EE EON

1. The operational aspects of Phase I portrays a mission which
has considerable potential but also considerable risk. The
area of infiltration is within five miles of a cruise missile
site and its accompanying radar. .In addition boat patrols are

* Known to work this portion of the coast at frequent intervals.

/ Once: infiltrated the team will not have to travel far before
heir first contact. However, A/3 is leary of Staying at his
ther's farm) for any length of time and he does not want his

wt Zather)to know of his presence in Cuba. For this reason the

"farm will not be able to serve as a safehouse. A/2 plans on
leaving the farm the same day lands. This presents the

nf

_problem of what to dé» ens ave On approach is to take A/3

14-00000

td Guanabo or Havana and safehouse him. This, however, may
jeopardize the operation because A/3 lacks the maturity and
patience necessary to stay put while A/2 goes about his busi-
‘ness. He may take advantage of his visit to Havana to under-
take a clandestine assignment on his own. When A/2 and 3
. step ashore in Cuba, control will vanish. Fortunately A/2
-has .a sufficient resource of judgement to go about his busi-
ness competently. Unfortunately A/3 gives no such indication.
For this reason an attempt will be made to steer A/3 towards
developing assets around his (father's farm)with maritime
reception capabilities. zy

of supporting assets tg; provide for hissafety while in Havana.
However, he has not sesi\Vvals) and UARTE) for over a year. In
addition both men are presently outside of the Cuban Army

flict with A/2's evaluation ofthis man. While there is no
evidence to verify that ARTE {is pro-regime, thexe Mta]is

ete

a recent report on him from AM /3 which claims (DUARTE]is an
opportunist who might work for th tae eS h bidder .ofA/2's
’ rebuttal to these remarks is that [DuARTE) ks assisted him in
"the past and when the chips wer wn he continued to aid him
in his underground activities.o6This still leaves a question
mark next to the worth of( DUARTE Which unfortunately can only
be resolved by direct. contact between him ‘and A/2, There are
_ other security implications which should be discussed in this
“ : evaluation. Both A/2 and A/3 cannot be considered truly se-
a oo" curity conscious, While safehoused A/2 wrote a letter to a
‘contact in- Miami which was to be transmitted by his case
officer. The letter gave an indication that A/2 was seeking
. contacts in Havana and conveyed the impression that a trip
was in the dfing. A/2 has written several other letters
not seen by his C Os which might have given the same impres-
sion._A on the other hand tal quite freely abo ‘
q

first to Miami and chee to Cuba. Once there they would go
to his father's farm a d_ begin to make contacts. A/3 also
stated ‘that a man named (DUARTE) ould be one of their con-
tacts. This loose talk Goupléd with A/3's attitude that
KUBARK exists only to serve him makes him a Marginal candi-
_ ,date for this operation. However, if A/3 is exfiltrated
oe * ..three-days after his entry into Cuba, the operation will
. ‘. gain his usefulness and eliminate some of the risk he
presents, — . oe

-Q-

3.- The above evaluation stresses the operational and security
weeknesses in this operation. In contrast to these weaknesses
are the positive considerations of this mission. A/2 has the
intelligence, competence, and confidence to approach and re-

cruit two assets with the potential for developing anti-regime

' operations. at a high level within the Cuban Army. The results

Iv.

‘which these anti-regime activities can accomplish is a matter
for conjecture but it appears that they carry potential.
Nevertheless, if the operation continues, it will bear close
watching in terms of security and control for these factors
will jeopardize the operation as well as KUBARK's position

if not properly contained.

His father, now deceased, was a prominent individual in law

COVER AND COMMUNICATIONS
SOVER AND COMMUNICATIONS

AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 will live black during their entire stay
‘in Cuba. They will be equipped with alias documentation and
with disguises. Both of them have previously lived in the
Havana area and know the city well. They will be trained in
Secret Writing (SW) and will plan to train at least two and
‘possible ‘three agents in Havana-in SW, prior to their own
\exfiltration. In addition, it is Planned to train A/27 and
.A/14 in OWVL. At the time of infiltration, exfiltration plans
‘will have been laid on with the agents. In the event that a
Change in time or location of exfiltration becomes necessary,

- an OWVL message could be sent to the agents, Any urgent and

immediate message which might have to be sent by the agents
during their short Stay in Havana would be on a prearranged
open code system by commercial telegram. Such a System will
be worked out to cover several possible contingencies, In-
ternal communications of whatever net is organized by A/27
and A/14 will be a ranged by courier, cut-out, live and dead
drops, — . . a

OPERATIONAL AND SECURITY EVALUATION

ough it is the opinion Of bo e
training personnel who have been in
se individuals that both agents are

hikhiy motivated and strongly anti-communist, this point “will
remain basically unresolved since it is almost certain that

AMICE/27 has not seen his contacts in the army for the .
eist two years. Although it is difficult: to assess how well
he knows various persons in the military about whom he speaks,
-it is the case officer's opinion that few of these contacts
. might be considered really close, .AMICE/14 has been out of
. : direct touch with his operational contacts since July 1961.

4a The infiltration into Cayo Cinco Leguas is dependent
upon having a good guide in the boat, At this time, Phase
‘II is awaiting the recruitment of AMTRUNK/4 as guide.

5. Control over AMICE/27 and AMICE/14 is ‘pasically lacking.

Some control can be exerted through the implied threat of .

- withholding support to the operation. Control however will

remain tenuous at best and A/27. will continue to be a dit-
we ficult handling problem,

6. On the. positive Side of “the ledger is the calibre. of the
- agents, both of whom are well educated, astute, and highly
- motivated. 8 ts_h , a

clandestine entries and exits and has many operational con-
tacts. To date both have performed in a superior manner in
training. — .

V. FUTURE PLANS .

Duringthe week of 1 through 6 April, the team will receive
maritime instruction, During the week 8 through 13 April,
they will receive SW training, possibly OWVL training, dis-
guise training, and further operational planning sessions.

ad, the following principle, which Ire
it icliee was enunciated during his

14-00000

democratic principles; ‘ODYOKE does not-desire to impose a
| government of its own choice upon Cuba".. A/27 has made a
pV big point of - ‘discussing this "commitment". It is apparent
\" . that he intensely dislikes (or fears?) Batista and his
\Y | followers. It is also apparent that in his mind he links
! Batista and. KUBARK, and fears that KUBARK would back Batis-
tianos in a post- -Castro government.

point they are very sensitive.

' 3, Another commitment which AMICE/27 claims to have discussed
in ZRMETAL is that ODYOKE should give "official recognition"
’ to members of a conspiracy which culminates in a successful
i coup d'etat, following the coup, in order that. these individual:
: will not be treated as political criminals by a future regime,
; This means recognition of an individual's participation in
' | the conspiracy, not a promise of recognition of a specific
. government formed by the conspirators themselves.

: 4, ‘Discussion of the above "commitments" has been pressed

i. : several times by A/27, PEGGINS has not agreed to any of these
commitments with A/27. However, A/27 feels that the com-
mitments have already been made by ODYOKE in ZRMETAL. PEGGINS
has told A/27 that he will report these "commitments" back
to ODYOKE to determine if, in fact, ODYOKE considers them as
commitments. :

6, One further negative commitment has been discussed between
