MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

‘SUBJECT: 303 Committee Meeting - 18 June 1964

1. Item I: Autonomous erations.

This was raised in view of Manuel Ray's request for
- $25, 000 and indications that he is attempting to make a new expedition to
Cuba in a chartered ship. Various courses of possible action with Ray
were discussed, ranging from.cutting him off altogether to giving him
the money. It developed that Ray is acting inconsistently with the agreement
with him which was that he would operate outside the United States. Therefore
it was decided that we would tell him that he must abide by the agreement,
that he must find.a base of operations outside the United.States and if he does
we will endeavor to secure the release of his ship which is now in Puerto Rico,
and that we will give him financial support.
we 2. With respect to antime 2 was pointed out that Artime's
operations are very costly. CIA has pur( 4. 6 smillion nto this operation
this year - the future bill will be large, bUt not as great. FitzGerald
reported that Artime planned one hit and run.operation a month, but he noted
he would be lucky if he could pull off one every 3 months. Bundy seemed to
feel Artime was more of a threat than an operator and should be maintained
for that purpose and operations discouraged. FitzGerald pointed out this is
not practical. It was agreed to proceed with Artime recognizing that U.S.
or CIA support of him would probably be "blown''. Furthermore it was.
suggested that he be cautioned to be careful and not follow unduly reckless
courses of action.

3. There was a long discussion on the implications of the CIA
June 10th memorandum reporting plans of Cuban exiles to assassinate leading
Cuban, government leaders. This report was taken most seriously by the group.
It was felt that the purpose of advising us through CIA of these plans was to
put us on notice and therefore we should not fail to take appropriate precautionary
actions to see that no assassination attempt of which we had knowledge was
carried out. It was decided that ‘appropriate authorities, i.e. Department of
Justice and the FBI, .. should be notified and urged to take appropriate action
against the individuals. involved. .

I took the position that we are overly exercised, that I was
inclined to write the whole thing off as Miami cocktail party talk rather than
definite plans. Had I seen the Memo before it was distributed, I would have
investigated the sources and the credibility of the whole thing before taking
action. However the group were more concerned than I and therefore planning to
discuss the subject with the Attorney General and possibly Mr. Hoover.

13-00000- -

I pointed out that copies of the Memorandum had been sent
to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice but there had been
no conversation on the subject.

.ACTION: Discuss with General Carter and Mr. Helms
steps we should take to establish the
credibility of the report; also communicate
with the FBI through Mr. Papich. Also l
should call the Attorney.General personally.

4. Prior to the meeting Mr. Vance asked my opinion of using
the 22 million psyops leaflets which inadvertently had been printed on

U.S. manufactured white sulphite paper, all as reported in MACV
cable MAC SOG 5050 dated 18 June 1964 (IN 09143). I told Vance that I felt

we should go ahead. It was too bad it had been done this way, but it is one of
those things that a person not thoroughly acquainted with this type of operation

might overlook. He was in agreement and presumably will instruct the release
of the leaflets. ‘ :

Alexis Johnson and Mr. Bundy raised: questions of the conse quences
of finding an arms cache or knocking over an infiltration at the time of the
OAS debate on the Venezuelan problem. Arguments were persuasive that _
we should go slowly during this period. I read from the February 25th
Cuban checklist of the deterioration of the spirit of the people of Cuba,. the
feeling that we were about to recognize the Castro government.and the apathy
toward further resistance as evidence of the price we are paying for
slow-downs and deferments of action against Cuba. I said that I thought our
Cuban program was in:‘complete disarray. We had no policy or covert
operations. We now are hesitating on infiltration and exfiltration, our

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Clandestine and Covert Activities Against Cuba

The objective of the U. Ss. Government is to overthrow.
the Castro/Communist regime in Cuba, In accomplishing its
objective, the U. S. is not willing to risk nuclear war or, at
this time, | substantial deterioration in its relations with its
Allies, or significant escalation in tensions between this .
country and the Soviets. Thus, any covert U. S, program
should be set at a level that is not likely to incur’ such risks,
Such a program would appear to be a low-risk, clandestine
program of harassment and sabotage directed against Cuba,
In addition, a program of higher risks seems justified when
it is directed against Cuban subversion of Latin America.

Actions Against Cuba |

1, Sabotage. A low level campaign of sabotage and
harassment against Cuba might include such targets as the
Canete Saw Mill, smaller POL storage plants (such as the
one at Pilon), the Nazabal warehouse and pier, and ships
(such as barges or Cuban patrol boats), Where possible,
it would. seem desirable to make the raids appear to have
come from within Cuba, Cuban ships outside Cuba can be sabotaged
by discreet means (such as placing sand in gears or sugar in fuel).

2. Harassment of Free World Shipping to Cuba.

a) Initiate a more comprehensive program of
overt and covert pressure against Free World firms trading

7 ‘with Cuba. In this connection, develop.a comprehensive list

of firms doing business with Cuba, check them against known
DOD off-shore and foreign purchase suppliers so that
appropriate retaliation can be applied against those suppliers,

b) Place unactivated incendiary and explosive
devices in cargoes and on ships bound for.Cuba and subse- .
quently "tip  off'' port or shipping offigials so that they will
search and discover the devices with the attendant publicity.

cOPYNo, fof & —scopics

3. Covert Economic Activities.

a) Intensify covert activities directed against
critical commodities destined for Cuba with resort, if
necessary, to.carefully considered and controlled preclu-
sive ‘buying. ; oo

b) Make it known discreetly through the press
that we maintain careful records of the companies dealing
with Cuba, suggesting without saying so that these records
constitute a potential "blacklist. "

c) Form a group of responsible and qualified
Cuban exile businessmen to maintain pressure on firms
trading with Cuba by indicating that such firms will have
no future in a post-Castro Cuba.

4. To the extent possible, encourage dissidence
among different factions in Cuba - Peking, Moscow,
Nationalist -~ by spreading rumors, internal and
external sabotage designed to accomplish this purpose
(such as actions against homes of leaders, etc).

Actions Against Cuban Subversion in Latin America

1. Develop a list of vulnerable Cuban agents in Latin
America against whom a concentrated program of bribery,

blackmail and coercion canbe instituted.

2. Carefully select key Latin American members of

| the Havana-Peking school and institute a program of kidnapping,

and personal and physical harassment, while attempting to
‘attribute these acts to rivals who support Moscow, Institute
the reversé process as a retaliatory program against Moscow

. supporters,

Any of the foregoing activities would be conducted against
a background of U. S, propaganda: (black, white and gray) and
political activity designed to increase internal dissension within
Cuba, to support economic isolation of Cuba, to avoid splitting °
with our allies over the Cuban issue and.to reduce, and perhaps
eliminate, Castro subversion of Latin America, . In addition,
surveillance activities should be significantly stepped up.
