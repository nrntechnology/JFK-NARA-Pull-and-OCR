2. On 15 and 16 Juhe 1964, the undersigned and Mr, Bob
Ricker, T3D/SDB went to Isolation to test an open sight hood for
: the 7.62mm Belgium (FAL) Rifle developed in answer to Ref. A.
i The Modified Willians peop sight developed previously in answer
i to Ref. A and reported on in Ref. B. proved unsatisfactory to the
: ' requester, The snap-on 6ight hood was then Geveloped on a quick
reaction basis to bo sizpler to install and easier to use than
- the Williams sight. In addition scna improved underloaded 7.62:m
KATO rounds having e@oft. annealed cases and crease of wheat filler
. Were tested for performance. These vere developed in hopes of

tho erratic commision psrferassce, 00406 .48. Ref «,Be..:x,-: —

‘ 2. The open sight hood Snaps over the existing rear sight
_ Of the PAL rifle, and in theory makes shooting in poor light or
8% Bight easier. It can be used with either atandard factory
:.-1.- + loads or the underloaded asmunition in conjunction with the muzzle
to ‘attachment silencer. The notch on the rear eight hood is "U" shaped
. and raised to compensate for the nore curving trajectory of the low
. Velocity ammunition. The hood is easily detached making the con-

*: wentional peep sight evailable any tine it is desired. -.

“3. The attached data sheet suznarizes the test results. It.

vas found that some familiarization vas necessary to get used to
am thd open sight. Under ideal conditions the sight was as easy to :
- Use as the poop sight although it was nore difficult to maintain %
uniform vertical grouping. The relationship botween the eye and
. Year sight was found to be very critical. As the tests proceeded - .
& change was noted in the point of impact ws. point of aim which was |

thought to be due to a change in sight picture on the part of the

in performance. The use of crean of wheat filler to tamp the powder at
charge against the primer was ag attempt to get mors even ignition =

S. Tests were conducted in the evening to determine the degree
of usefulness of the sight in poor light. In this respect a 22
Caliber Hi-Standard pistol with folding shoulder stock and Bushnell
1.3X Phantom scope waa tested in comparison. The scope was
equipped with yellow filters to brighten the sight picture for
: low light level use. It was the opinicn of both test personnel :
i-- +. 2. that the scope was superior to either the peep sight or open aight Le
: foz as long as their vas some illumination on the silhouctte .
targets. Once the light failed the scope was completely useless
although the undersigned could still discern targats with the naked
eye out to 50 yds, All actual shooting was done with the open
: Sight and some difficulty was experienced in hitting the targets
: at ranges of 100 yds. or sore even at dusk. The closer targets
. could be easily hit up until it becass too dark to seo them at all.
A large rain cloud poving from behind the firing position gradually
. obscured all available light. For the final shooting at 25 yds.
.’ | @€easional lightning flashes gave only a vague awareness of the
_, target location. At no time during the night trials was there an
7 " mugele flash visible fro= the under loaded ammunition and muzzle z
' pYlencer combinatios. @ g&5 por was '@ O©2 position
luring @ day Tials was turned on at night but no flash was
visible at the breech. A fine white cloud of cream of wheat
povder was visible in front of the muzzle at almost full darkness
- but could not be seen sore than 30 feet avay. .

6. Listener trials were conducted the following day to deter-
Sine bow far away an alert listener could discern the mechanical
‘ poise of the mechanism and that of the round being fired. Mr. Ricker
Walked away downwind at an sagle of 90 degrees to the line of fire
and stopped to listen every 25 paces. The undersigned fired
_ Single rounds, (hand actuating the nechanise) each time Nr. Ricker
y Stopped, At 325 paces, or roughly 275 yds., Er. Ricker reported. _..;;
he could still hear the mechaniss being actuated, the round being.
fired, and the bullet striking a concrete pillar 200 yds. down-~
range, However, he stared that he might not have noticed the sound
at that range had he not been listening for it specifically. :

* %, One of the major causes for concern at the start of the
tests was that the cream of wheat filler sight clog the silencer
and render it ineffective. A total of 200 rounds were fired with
the silencer in plsce and the noise level did seem to be higher at
, the finish of the second day. (Round numbers 180 to 200 were the . :
ones expended during the previously nentioned listener trials). nt
Inspection of the silencer at a later date revealed considerable a
cream of wheat residue in the screening. Sound level measurements
Bade in the AMF sound lab showed that while the total noise levei

". was no higher, the duration was relatively longer, This would

make the silencer seem louder to near by observers but not increase  —
the range at which it could be heard. However, from a stand-
" point of tho ability for a listener to discrininate a a@ilencer
being fired from random noise, the longer duration gives hin a
better chance to recognize what he hears.

8. On 19 June 1964, the undersigned vent to the warehouse
at Franconia to try to fit the sight hood to other 7.65mm FAL
rifles, It was suspected that the fit might be a problem when it
would not fit over the rear sighta of three FAL rifles at Isolation.
Although it was later determined that the throe rifles.vere of a
daifferent lot and say therefore have different tolerances on the
rear sight casting, it was felt that further checking was necessary.
Mine PAL rifles from the sane lot as those obtained by WH/SA/MOB/PY
were unpackaged and the sight hood tried on the rear sight. Of
the nine, two were perfect fits and the other seven too thick .
for the hood to fit. This created a problem in that the sight
hoods bad to fit rifles which for operational reasons could not be
measured before hand to determine the thickness of the rear sight
blade. Providing adjusteent in the slot of the sight hood would
have complicated the fixture to the point where it could becoze
operationally unsuitable. Therefore it was determined that the
best solution was to provide several small files with the hoods.
The peep sight on the rifles, & soft casting, was found to be
quite easy to file. In most cases it would be necessary only to
file several thousandths to obtain a proper fit. This procedure
was explained to B/FM and he stated that it would be

acceptable. : . oo
