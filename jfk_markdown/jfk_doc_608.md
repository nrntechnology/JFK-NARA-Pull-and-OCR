tition with the dominant AP and.the long-established APRA,
both reformist parties, and thus should not be included in a
Listing of significant CD parties. Some weight is added to
this arguzent by the very recent split off of a dissident
fection of the PDC into a separate party. However, the
inclusion of the Peruvian party here is based primarily on the
fact that it is the only CD yroup participating in a coalition

Gilitancy in the near “future appears’ unlikely. The PRSC has

wTes -fren-the university Yanks, and is buttressed by the Strongest
ffiliate (CASC) in the Henisphere.

(ago and polled only’3.1 percent of ‘the votes in 1964. Although
it ccntinues a-miniscule party, it has madé significant

orsentatiozal strides and its philosophy of. gocial justice

gives it roots lacking by most Panamanian parties, which are

tars sely pérsonalistic or tied to. financial interests. “If the

attracts militants “fram.-the predominantly negro and mestizo

_ population, it could bécone a force of some importance.

-.¢, While the Brazilian PDC polled a mere 4 percent of
‘the vote in 1964, the Party has significant strength in three
‘-auy states of the Center-South (Parana,:Sao Paulo, and
Gusnabsra), Like all other pre-Castello Branco political
parties, the PDC was unable to campaign under its own banner
in the. presidential and parlimentary elections of late 1966.

- Expanded political activity will probably be permitted after
the seating ‘of President Costa e Silva in March 1967, but it
is expected. that the number of legally recognized political
-parties will be limited, It appears -likely. that the PDC will

5. CD Strencth- dn ‘Universities Ahead: of Party’ Strénsth. As
with all political groups: in-Latin ivertea, € the vast majority of
cD party militants are draw froa the. ranks of student’ appendages

active in. the local universities. In most countries of the hemi-.
sphere, cD voting’ stréagth oa the cespus is much more significant
: the political strength of the parent party. A.few examples.
= dLlustrate this: point ‘anana, the Party: polled 3.1 percent
“o£ the vote-in-1964. (and*probably would poll not more than 5
percent today), while its University youth got -12.8 percent in the.
ry 1966 clection, - The Doainican PRSC received 5.4 percent of.
thé Vote in 1962 (ahd its present strength could well be lower
“: because of internal divisions and leadership conflicts), but its
youth wing on the ¢ampus garnered 40,2 percent ‘of ‘the vote in
May 1966. I Vetiezucla, “COPEL polled 22 percent of the vote in
1953; ies student wing on the campus of the Central University,
-howover, polled, 40.2 percent of the vote in 1966, These comparitive
figures suggest soac conclusions which are presented in Paras. 19

; acd 20 below.

: 6. Radieglizs ation of Youth Wines. -Sevéral cD leaders, most
motably Frei and Caldora, 1, have expressed considerable concern over
the growing radicalization of party youth wings, That youth groupa
of every political stripa assume positions to the left of their
partics is nothing new, but the situation in several CD groups has.
gotten badly out of hand. In several countries only an opaque line
divides the positions asswaed. by CD youth groups (or important wings)
from the ctance assuned by Marxist youth elements. “In Venezuela,
.the wing of the COPEL youth headed by Marta Sosa is so "far-out"

it has eared ‘the sobriquet "the Astronauts." Chilean President
Frei report tedly told a German Christian Democrat that his youth
wing i 1 danger of becoming Marxist. In Panama, the dominant
wing of the CD youth has assuaed positions at least as radical as
the Communists. And in the Dominican Republic the Social Christian
GZroup in the National University is allied with the Communist

‘students.

7. Youth Tending to Push Parties Further Left. The great
coneerm or responsible party ‘ty leaders is that youth input to the
parties will swell the ranks of the radical wings and push the

parties further left. Some observers believe that the CD youth

" probiea has been exaggerated and, that the "bot heads" will mellow

_ once they partictpste directly in party life and cope with hard -
political reality. While this is “partially true, we would take
issue with this relaxed view. Tho raw material to be molded is
far diffcrent than it was ten years ago; since that time the demand
for revolutionary (even -convulsive) change has mushroomed -- ard
tha youth the cry has assumed din proportions, The natural

ving process. will no. longer produce the same magic.

8. ned for treinins. Some believe that the only way of
rresting the cD: youth ‘erift ‘to the left in the foreseeable future

ITI - TEE IMPACT OF CrASC ON TIE CHRISTIAN DENCCRATIC MOVEMENT

: 9. CLASC Poses Serious Dancer for CP Moversat. A KUMOXK

. Study points out-that "Organized labor could contribute substantially
to. the “development of well-organized CD. political parties in the.
‘hemisphere, ‘but it also offers the best chance for-CD extrenists
to cause harm'to the movesent." Few would argue that how the CD
movement fares and the imaso it projects depend in not insignificant
mecsure.on. the posture assuced and progress achieved by: CLASC.”

‘More often than not, the judgement of a mass movement is based on

the worst, element comprising it +- and in this regard CLASC is

challenged only by the party ‘youth and student wings. AS an
organized labor force CLASC has been a dismal failure (with the .
exception of its campesinos am); its only impact and sole raison
die tp to this time has been. as a political action isstrument
with primary appeal to the working classes, It is unlikely that
CLASC, under Maspero leadership, will mellow as do parties when
they achieve the responsibility of government.

10. CLASC Ras Maintained Posture of Independence. Despite its
"Christian'™ label, CLASC has consistently maintained that it is not
subservient to the Christian Democratic movement or any renber _
party, The statement cannot be disputed, for while CLASC is guilty
of most of the seme aberrations as the least responsible of the CD
parties, it invariebly comits its follies independently, (often,
in fact, setting an example that is emulated by the parties), But
while CLASC can defend its claim of independence, it is also true
that CLASC docs net discourage the belief that it is the chosen .
labor instrument. of the Christian Democratic movement, although |
this label has never been formally bestowed, ;

It appears likely that a more organic participation of ELASC in CD

-of Christian Democratic parties, The Seminar, called for the
specific purpose of arranging closer coordination betweea the CD
political moveacnt and the Christian labor movement, resulted in
the signing of the "Carta de Moatevideo" on 20 April. The Act
calls for formal representation of ODCA in both tha Christian

“V+ EUROPEAN CD ROLE AND INFLUEN

16. The: Furopean Christian Democratic Union (ctu). The
European CD -) parties we: were first to. establish a ‘a regional organization,
‘the Nouvelle Equipe Internationales (KEI) in 1947, The NEI never
played a major role in world Christian Democratic affairs, From

- the outset the Latia Acericen parties maintained their closest
ties with individual leacers of the CD movement in Surope,. particue
larly those involved in financial operations with the sister parties
and CLASC in Latin Awerica. The NEI becama progressively -less
significant end in recent years was virtually moribund. But in
mid-1965 the organization uas revamped and re-christened as the
European Christian Democratic Union (ECDU). Its nevly elected ~
President, Mariano Pucor, Secretary General of .the Italian PDC,
appears intent on making the ECBU a strong organization which will
at least match the Socialist International in stature. Ls

17, European; “Binanetel Swwort to. the: i Parties. The two CD
orgenizations which have contributed most heavily to the support
of the Latin American CD parties ‘and related organizstions. are the
Institute for International Solidarity (11S) and the International
Solidsvity Foundatioa (FIs). Between then they will. contribute
an estimated $500, 000 to $1,609,000 to the CD par ties and CLASC in
Calendar Year 1957, It was recently reported that the COPEI party-
of Venezucla vill receive $480,000 for the 1963 election from FIS

CONCLUSIONS

“19, co's Challente Communist Domination of the University.
It wes noted in Para. S above that almost without exceptioa CD.
atrenzth in the university greatly exceeds the voting strength of
the parent party. The same is true Of the Communists, and it is
a Zaet that Cowzunist/Christian Democratic strength on the campus
is overwaelsinzly doainant throughout the hemisphere. Few would
take fgste with the conclusion that the vast najority of university
youth are attracted to movements projecting an inspirational —
message (tha word “inspirational” nore accurately characterizes
the CD roveront than does "idcological") or sn aura of revolutionary
mystique. During the past few years Communist voting losses in
the university have been picked up mainly by the Christian Democrats
-- the vote has shifted from one movement with a messaze to another.

able of challenging the Coamunists" hoaiaphoric doaination

cieisTiAN DEMOCRACY: IN LATIN AMERICA

The. decisive victory of Eduardo Frei in the sep-
‘tember 11964 Chilean presidential election led many” to
hope that Christian Democracy would develop signifi-.
cantly throughout Latin America, competing with -Com-
munism on ideological grounds and ‘offering an alterna+
tive, democratic route to social and economic progress.

No such trend. has yet developed. The Christian
Democrati¢ movement's appeal is.to students and niddle
class, a relatively small percentage of the pepulation
in most Latin American countries, ~Its concepts of
basic social reform and the dignity of the human person
may appeal ‘to the workers, but thay still cast their

“vote ona Pragmatic basis for the least objectionable

of the established parties that have an immediate chance

“. of governing:

The movement's progress “is likely ‘to be hampered
by its lack of strong leaders and effective labor or-
ganizations to compete against the entrenched posi-
tions of other political movements,

. Current Balance Sheet -

The Christian Democratic
movement is generally agreed to
be of current political- signifi-
cance in only four Latin. American

countries--Chile, Peru, Venezuela,

and El Saivador.

. In. only one of “these+~Chile--
is the Christian Democratic Party
(PDC) the governing party. rei's
solid victory in the 1964 presi~
dential election was followed by
an “even more impressive showing |
in the March 1965 congressicaal
election. However, the party's’
reform program has run into dif+
ficulty in the upper house of
Congress, which is still con-
trolled by the opposition; no
progress has been made in weaken-

ing Marxist domination of the’
urban labor force; and-Frei's

“moderation has been increasingly

challenged by the left. wing of
his own party, which may capture
control in the next two or three
years.”

The only other Christian
Democratic party with a claim to
a role in government is the one
in Peru. It was brought into a
pre-election coalition by the
dominant Popular Aétion Party
in 1963 and, although it gained
only four percent of the votes,
it holds two cabinet posts. Its
voting strengrh has been weakened
recently by the defection of a
dissident faction which formed a
separate Popular Christian Party.

vote in 1964 (and probably would
poll not more than $ percent to-
day), but its university youth
got 12.8 percent in the January
1966 campus election and 24.4

Dominican PPSC received 5.4 per-
cent of the vote in 1962‘(and ‘its
present strength could well be
lower because of internal divi-
sions and leadership conflicts),-
but its youth wing on the campus
garnered 40,2 percent of the

vote in May 1966. In Venezuela,
COPEI polled 22 percent of the

-vote in 1963; its student wing on

‘Several CD leaders, most

notably Frei in Chile:.and: Caldera

in Venezuela, hav
siderable concern over the grow-
Ang -radicalization of party youth
wings. In Several countries the
positions assumed by .CD ‘youth
groups (or important wings) are
almost indistinguishable. from
those of pro-Communist youth ele-

“ments. In Venezuela, the wing

of the COPEI youth:headed by

_ Marta Sosa is ‘so’ “far out” it

has earned the sobriquet “the
Astronauts.". Chilean: President
Frei reportedly told a- German .
Christian Democrat that his youth
wing is moving dangerously far
to the left. “In Panama, the

‘dominant wing of the CD youth has

assumed positions at least as
radical as the Communists. And
in the Dominican Republic the
Social Christian group in the Na-

tional University, while differ-
entiating itself from the Commu-

‘nist students on certain issues,
has frequently taken a parallel
line, ua

. The great concern of respon-
sible party leaders is that these
students, as they progress from

campus to parent party, will swell

the ranks of the radical wings

and push the parties further left.

Other observers, however, expect
the “hotheads" to mellow once
‘they participate directly in
Party life and cope with hard
political, reality. Both views
‘can be defended. Some mellowing
is inevitable, but in the past .
ten years the demand for revolu-
tionary (even convulsive) change
has mustroomed--and among the
youth the cry has assumed much
greater proportions.

“Both German and American
observers have commented that
massive and intensive political...

cadres might arrest “this drift
to the left. Frei and‘Caldera

shave specifically asked the West

German CD party's Institute for .
International Solidarity to in- .
crease its support in the student

.training field. However,: the

Germans, who have long been pro--
ponents of oraanizational programs
in Latin America, appear inclined
to the position in the youth and
student field that party leaders
have permitted the situation to
deteriorate too long for even a-
massive training program to pro-
duce a moderating trend,

The Labor Arm |

A major “influence in the
development of the Christian
Democratic movement will be the
actions and attitudes of its
labor organization, the Latin
American Confederation of Chris-
tian Trade Unionists (CLASC). :
So far, as.an organized force, it
has been.a dismal failure except
among the campesinos. Its only
impact and sole purpose up to
this time has been as a political
action instrument with primary
appeal to the working classes.

In this role, it ha$ earned a
reputation for independent action
and irresponsibility that hag re-
flected negatively on the whole
movement despite CLASC's vigorous
claims that it is not subservient
to the Christian Democratic po-
litical ledders, < - .

the CD movement, a closer and’
more formal.relationship appears.
to be in the offing. Last April,

' officials of: CLASC who are also

officers of the Christian Demo-.
cratic parties met in: Montevideo

to arrange closer coordination

between the-two groups... To ac-

complish this goal, they proposed-
that both the CD party labor de- -
partments and CLASC be granted’ _

‘formal representation’ in the

Christian Demoératic Organiza~

‘tion ‘of America (ODCA), the re-

gional grouping fomed. din 1949...

The plan has not yet been.

‘implemented, but, eventual ODCA

approval appears: likely.. Closer

“,CLASC identification with ithe CD

political movement may have an_
adverse effect on Cd youth
wings,-which--being further left
than their parent parties--have

‘identified more closely with

CLASC's revolutionary image.
Since the first. of the year, ~
CLASC has intensified. its ef-
forts to create: its own youth
groups and appears to have made
some progress, especially in
Central America.

The Role of ODCA ~ .

In its 17 years of existence,

ODCA has not. evolved beyond a
sort.of fraternity held together

| more by-negative factors such as

hostility to the’US, to capital-

- ism, and to the oligarchies, than

by any basic agreement among its

members on doctrine or principles.

Moreover, the individual parties
have made very clear that they
will fight any. effort--whether
initiated by ODCA or by the Eu-
ropean financial backers of the
CD movement--to impose standards

and ‘controls that will impinge
on their freedom of action,

In gencral, ODCA takes a -:
Slightly less hostile line on |.”
US. policies than that of its
membér parties, This probably
results from-the influence of
its president, Rafael Caldera of
Venezuela, -Thé organization's
two vice presidents are Hector
Cornejo Chavéz of Peru and ‘Rene
De Leon of Guatemala, Tomas Reyes
Vicuna of-Chile is its secretary
general,

Only in Central America has
there been any move toward a
more cohesive unit geared to area
problems. A smaller regional

_ group, the Christian Democratic

Union of Central America, was or-

- ganized last July. .It now has

five member parties, in Guatemaia,
El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica,
and Panama, and a sixth may be

-formed in Honduras.

European Role and Influence .

Although Latin American
Christian Democracy like the Eu-
ropean variety, has its roots in
the profoundly humanistic and
democratic ideas of the French
philosopher Jacques Maritain, it
does not contain the European

. fascist concept of the corporate

state. The European reaction to
the growth of: Communism in the
1930s had little effect on the
Latin American CDs; consequently
the Americans were moving to the
political left as. the Europeans
were moving to the right.

Cbs ‘attempt, to coordinate inter-
national CD activity through an
organization they: called-the New
International Team (NEI). This.
organization never, achieved any
_ significance because European *
influence in Latin America had

already been: undermined by a basic

_ difference in political philosophy

_. and because the Latin Anerican :

., parties: had been maintaining in-
dividual relations-with the var-

’ Gous European groups. These ties
-were strictly on vague. idéological
grounds and for financial reasons.

The two heaviest European
contributors to. the Latin Ameri-
can parties are the Institute for
international Solidarity. (IIS) and

“the International Solidarity
Foundation (FIS). Between them
‘they will contribute an estimated
$800,000 to, $1,000,000 to the
American CD parties and CLASC in
calendar year 1967. In addition,
it was recently réported that
the COPEI party of Venezuela will
receive $480,000 for the 1968
election from FIS.

The. IIS, under the direction
of Adolf Herkenrath, is an arm
of the West German Christian
Democratic Union with the bulk
of its budget coming directly
from the German government. It
maintains several ‘permanent rep~
resentatives in Latin America
and supports youth and student
‘groups, political training insti-
tutes, and CLASC organizations.

The PIS, under the leader-
ship of Dr. Johannes Schauff,
Operates as an arm of the European
Christian Democratic Union (ECDU) ,
successor to the NEI. Since.its

1 -
van \ : -
creation ‘in 1964, Germans and
Italians ‘have contributed almost
its entire budget. FIS appears

to be the exclusive European
channel fer organizational support
to the Latin American parties.

It has’ assumed this responsibility

because it, is,composed of repre-

sentatives: of all the European
parties. Thus the responsibility
for support to certain contro-
versial Latin parties is watered
down .and distributed among the
European COs collectively. Fur-

| thermore, a Latin American gov~

ernment: or party in’ competition
with the local CDs “cannot formally
protest its funding activities

to the German government.

Outlook

_ The modest progress made by
the Christian Democratic mavement
in the past two-and a half years
suggests that its development
will be much slower and less ex~
tensive than many anticipated in
the first flush of enthusiasm
following the Frei victory.

One major problem is its
failure to reach the lower so-
cial @lasses and to develop a
significant worker base. Its
strength in the universities
and its ability to compete with
Communist groups on the campus
create unfounded optimism, The
"inspirational" approach that .
attracts the college student
has no comgarable appeal among
the inadequately educated lower
classes.

Neither does a victory for

‘document dated 29 May. This document included the following
- points: : 7

a. Discontent is becoming evident because of the lack of
activity which, in turn, results from the lack of funds.
The sum rentioned is $10,090.5 :

b. No change in United States policy vefariniZactlca . |

operations outside of the United States is considered
to be so vitally important that the military department
would be willing to operate an illegal base if the
resources were, made available.

qn) The -CADELLO I is docked across from Brito's Boat Yard
at Stock Island, Flarida.6 The boat is in need of.
repairs on the deck and superstructure, and the instal-
lation: of clectronic navigational equipment would be.
~", required to put it in operational condition. Current
vat . cocking and routine maintenance costs are not being
' paid. Efforts: tofmake commercial use of this boat have
‘.- net. been successful. Thia boat is considered ideal for
” activities which might be undertaken if there were a
base from which to operate, but under the present cir-
cumstances the expense which this boat represents ig
not justifiable. -It is recommended that consideration
: ‘be given to selling the CADELLO I if an operational

the executive ‘committee that he was going directly to Caracas,
Wenesuela. It was not until after his return that it was

learned that he had not gone to Caracas or to Guatemala as
he had planned. He later explained that whilé he was in
-Puerto.Rico he telephoned his relative in Guatemala and was
informed that the latter had “failed in ‘his efforts." .

pasado 13 de marzo, me considero obligado con el Gobierno, el Par-

mente atacados por Castro durante el transcurso de su alocuci6n, a

expresar mi opinién con relacidn a dicha ofensa,.

Digo obligadc, porque el hecho de ser demécratacristiano
ubano, integrante de esa gran comunidad de seres humanos que un
fa se dieron a la tarea de realizar una revoluci6én en libertad y
que lamentablemente vieron tronchadas sus aspiraciones al compro-
ar que las mismas eran ahogadas por la sangre vertida en los pa-
redones de fusilamientos por hérces como Porfirio Ramirez, Presi-

instar y pedir mayor colaboraci6n con los patriotas que hoy ofren-

“Gan sus vidas por liberar a Cuba, a fin de evitar no solo la con-

tinuada masacre de cubanos que se lleva a cabo en la Isla, sino
tambien ponerle fin a todos estos incidentes bochoriosos para la
historia, en los que aparece un cubano, ofendiéndo piblicamente
ante el. mundo.la.un Presidente, a un Partido y’a un pueblo que a
contrario sensus de lo que 61 esta haciendo en Cuba, sf est4 rea-
lizando una revolucién en libertad, s{ ha defendido en todo momen
to el sano nacionalismo, s{ se ha puesto de frente cuantas veces
las circunstancias lo han requerido a los oligareas y explotado-

- res.

Para’ terminar, s6lo me queda reiterarle, que en nombre de
la solidaridad. que une a todos los dem6cratacristianos, exprese
pablicamente, su deseo de colaborar con la lucha que mantiene el
pueblo cubano por derrocar al castrocomunismo Y poder realizar en
Cuba, una verdadera revolucién en libertad, asf como su xespaldo
a la actitud asumida por el Gobierno, el Partido Demécrata Cris~
tiano y el pueblo chilero-en los actuales momentos.
