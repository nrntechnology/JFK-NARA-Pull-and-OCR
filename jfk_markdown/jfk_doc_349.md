‘ MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/COG

SUBJECT: “James C. Wray,

1. Lcalled Mr. James C. Wray today to determine his reason :
- for having called the Agency on 27 February regarding Antonio CUESTA —
Del Valles patent application. At that time Wray had stated that as a
- patent attorney he was representing CUESTA who had an application
pending on which some $140 in fees was due. :

2. Wray advised that he had been retained by CUESTA several —

“years ago to file an application cc.acerned with a high speed boat on
‘_ > . -which a patent was ready to issue upon payment of $140 in filing fees.
. He stated further that as a consequence of CUESTA's subsequent capture
“he had been unable to communicate with him. and that he had failed in his
afforts to interest CUESTA's friends in assuming responsibility for the
: fees. Wray readily accepted my representations that the Agency had no
- responsibility in the matter. According to him, he had called ue inerely
=a8 @ matter of last resort. SO a *

: -=9, Yfound Wray's description of the boat's configuration and
attributes to be interesting. While emphasizing that we had no re-

: eponsibility for his cliunt's pregent situation or for his fees, I suggested

_ that he might want to provide me with the boat's specifications. Wray

pos accepted thie sugsvetion, My thought here was that an item of this nature

| might be of interest to SOD/Maritime Branch.. . ‘
