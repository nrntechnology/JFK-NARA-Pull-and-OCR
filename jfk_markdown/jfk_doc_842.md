MEMORANDUM FOR: General Carter, DDCI

Attached is a copy of a memorandum for my file outlining
policy decision in connection with the Cuban prisoner transaction.
In your absence this memorandum was discussed with Messrs.
Helms, Heuston, Miskevsky and McManus, and upon receiving
final approval from higher authority at 1:45, Mr. Houston was
instructed by me to initiate appropriate actions.

It ie exceedingly important that great care be exercised
; to minimize the publicity and to emphasize humanitarian interest
on the part of the United States Government in securing the release
of the prisoners. Both the President and the Attorney General are
anxious that the explanations giventhe Cuban Families Committee
be handled with great care. I agree with this and urge that extreme
caution be taken to avoid attribution or CIA implication in this matter.

MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
CONCERNING THE NEGOTIATION FOR THE RELEASE OF THE CUBAN
PRISONERS.

The meeting took place at the residence. of the Attorney
General at 10:30 a.m., on a Thureday, November 14, at the DCI's

request.

, McCone explained that he had had dinner the evening before
with Mr, Edward Foley (former Under Secretary of the Treasury,.
legal representative and a Director of the Drug Industry. Association).

Mr. Foley had questioned DCI concerning the negotiations ©
for release of Cuban prisoners in exchange for some 50 million»
dollars in drugs, and stated that Mr. Donovan had been in touch with
members of the industry (presumably Pfizer and Merck) in the past
few days, that indications were that the transaction was to be worked
out promptly, and the subject would undoubtedly be discussed at
length at the Industry's Board of Trustees meeting in New York on
November 16th.

Mr. Foley stated that the Industry had no clear understanding
of the Government's position, most. particularly in view of Cuban

developments of the last three weeks.

After explaining to Foley the background of the transaction

I told him that Mr. Donovan had been told to do absolutely nothing

in thie matter and expressed great surprise that the subject was a
topic of current discussion among members of the Industry.

In the meeting with the Attorney General I expressed. grave
concern over the situation, pointing out ce hac: 20jmiltion |

connection had ever been admitted, publicity would implicate the

» Administration and CIA in the negotiation because of recent press

stories (most particularly the Herald Tribune articles). identifying
Administration and CIA activities and citing the.exact amount of

17 million! dollare as representing the Government cost of the drugs.

T pointed “out that certain elements of competition between the members
of the drug industry | made it almost « certainty that “leaks'! would
come. from industry sources as long ae. the letter of credit were
outstanding, regardless of Mr. Donovan's denials.

Furthermore, consummation of the transaction seemed
totally unrealistic in view of current difficulties with Castro and if
an article appeared indicating we were etill pursuing this transaction,
the American public and a great many others would be confused and
disenchanted.

For the above reasons, and feeling that damaging publicity
undoubtedly would appear, I strongly recommended that we arrange
for the. bank to withdraw the. Letters of Credit, . and_for the withdrawal

) of-a- substantial part of the money from the (Bank [of > Also

advise Mr. Donovan that the pursuit of this effort must await a better
climate although our interest remained constant. I urged that
action be commenced today.

The Attorney General, after some discussion involving an
exploration of possible alternatives, agreed with the course of
action.

“We agreed that we should carefully explain to the Families
Committee and possibly to Miro Cardona that we were in no way
abandoning our intention to secure the release of the prisoners but
were forced because of circumstances beyond our control to set the
negotiation aside pending further developments on other important
problems involving our Cuban relationship.

- MeCone discussed the above with Mr. Bundy who personally
approved the action and, in turn, received approval from higher
authority. The latter was communicated to the DCI by telephone
at 1:45 p.m

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Cline, DD (I)

SUBJECT: Castro as a Threat to the Americas.

I think that in analyzing Castro's potential in the Western
Hemisphere as covered by paragraphs 9 through and including 21,
we should consider his posture and potential under various alternatives
of possible United States decisions and probable Soviet policies,

Let us assume for the moment that the United States meets
the exact letter of the Kennedy-Khrushchev exchange and no more.
This would mean the withdrawal of IL 28s, the halting of. the establish-
ment of a submarine base, and some acceptable form of inspection
verifying the removal and assuring against the reintroduction of
offensive devices, U.S. commits not to invade, At this point U.S.
commitment on propaganda, sabotage, guerrilla activities and other
actions designed to overthrow Castro is not very clear, but I think
that we can assume that such activities if attempted would be no
more successful in the future than they have been in the past, -which is

about zero.

TOP SECRET

Having reached this point, the Soviets have at least three
alternatives: .

One, they can abandon Castro, reduce military and economic
aid, cut their losses, and in such event Castro would soon collapse.
Current intelligence does not support such a probable Soviet course
of action, otherwise they would not be disposed to leave such quantities
of extremely valuable modern military hardware, including the SAM
sites, communications equipment, and extensive Naval.and ground
equipment and a large number of technicians.

Second, they could maintain about the same level of economic
and military support as in the past, although I would feel this could not
be a very reasonable assumption from the standpoint of military support
as the presence of large amounts of additional military equipment, in-
cluding those mentioned above, would necessitate a higher level of
military support than before in order to provide operational readiness,
training, maintenance, spare parts, replacements, etc. This does not
mean more economic oupporthithough I think Castro could insist upon
it-on the grounds that Soviet equipment is a burden to him and of course

Dorticos alluded to this in statements in New York.

Third, the Sdéviets having accomplished one of their objectives,
that of securing a U.S. guarantee against invasion, will increase their
military and economic aid so that all military materiel will be work-
able at all times and the Castro economy will be reasonably well off.

. Under each. of these alternatives, Castro's posture and his
effect on the United States and other Western Hemisphere countries
will differ vastly and I would suggest that your paper be oriented so.
that it will project for the benefit of policy makers the consequences,
favorable or unfavorable, under these several alternatives.

It is my personal opinion that Mikoyan will return to New York
in a few days and will announce an agreement for some perfunctory
Red Cross ground inspection of the missile sites and nothing else,
will deny any intention of a submarine base, will dismiss the ‘IL 28
issue as wholly beyond the Khrushchev-Kennedy agreement, will
indicate that all Soviets are leaving Cuba except economic and
agricultural advisers, and will state most persuasively that the
Khrushchev-Kennedy agreement has been fulfilled to the letter and
demand our non-invasion commitment.

He will then build Castro up and indicate Soviet intention for

supporting in every way and to go right down the line with him,

Castro will feel secure, his political and military structure will be
manageable, and Cuba will be used by Castro and the Soviets more
aggressively in the future than it has in the past in disturbing ©
Western Hemisphere countries,

This is the situation 1 fear, and I think our policy makers
whose negotiations are trending toward the establidmment of a set

of conditions and commitments which will make the third case

mentioned above a probability, should have the benefit of our

thinking as to the consequences, In doing this, equal attention
should be given to the first two alternatives,

In further reference to the paper, the historical background
is excellent, the country by country annex useful, although if time
permitted we might get the chiefs of station to give the current view
of their contacts as Win Scott did, The inventory of equipment is
useful but I propose that it be broken down into three columns, a

pre-July lst, 1962, added since July 1962, and the total as of now,

SUBJECT: CIA activities in South Viet Nam

\

1, Prior to January 1962 the CIA maintained 6 modest station
in South Viet Nam, the purpose of which was to support the Ambassador

| threat to the government, and to assist the government in ite intersal

security probleme, Among other things we trained and equipped
Special Forces whose mission was to conduct a variety ef unconventional
activities euch as the infiltration of V.C. centers, interdiction of
supply routes, interfering with V.C. communications, sabotaging

v.G. eforts, harrassment, etc.

The CIA station crested about a dozen training centers
throughout South Viet Nam in which selected nearby villagers would
be trained in community defense and civic action, It issued arme and
thus provided the actual defense of the steategic hamlets created |
in the areas. These activities were carried on with the support of
the U.8, Special Forces. As the activities expanded, « determination
wae made to shift prime responsibility to the military, with CLA
in support, and the switch has been accomplished successfully.

_ About 75, 090 South Vist Namese have been trained.

I reported upon my return that repressive measures of the Diem/Nhu
regime were causing considerable criticism and thet there was

danger of a coup. This situation was watched carefully by our CIA
station and at frequent intervals we reported that the image of the
fogime was tarnishing and hence its effectivensss was questionable.
A aumber of estimates and a great number of reports and appraisals
were iaeued, each one warning that the deterioration of the regime's
popularity gave ties to serious question concerning the future trend

; of the war and CLA warned that unless corrective measures were

taken by the regime te improve ite image, it was quite possible
the war would be lost or that a popular uprising would cause the
removal of the regime. For 18 months at frequent intervals rumors
of coups were received by our station and were reported to the
Ambaesador and to Washington. Throughout this period our Chief
of Station at the direction of the Ambassador met once every two
weeks with Ngo Dinh Nha, explored. all problems relating to the

situations in which we had e common interest, and reported to the

Ambassador, Contacts were aleo maintained with many groups in
South Viet Nam, with military leaders and with knowledgeable
citizens,

A review of the reporting over 18 months and resulting
estimates bear out that the Agency consistently warned of the
deteriorating situation and the peseible consequences,
13-00000

During this period we also analysed the progress of the
war and the thrust of our reporting was to the effect that as the
Amsosican advisers were able to exercise their influence on the
Sesth Viet Namese military, and our Embassy and General Harkins
. were able to persuade Diem to reorient and redeploy his forces,
— gradual but consistent favorable progress wae made.

3. Atgttade af the Station and Others
/ In ony difficult sitestion involving guerrilla warfare where
progress can not be measured in territory won or lest, and in
casualties and prisoners, Gifferences of opinion among observers
arise, Likewise Americans required to work with a stubborn
and authoritarian regime often become exasperated by the
civil Mberties, freedoma, and the rights of the individual are
shocked by the conduct of @ government which deprives the individeal
of these privileges. Finally an American community living among
this is the case in Saigon and Hae), are bound to be influenced
by, and to a degres eupouse, these eriticiems.

For these reasons there have been serious differences within
the American community.

Within the CIA station there are differences of opinion.
Some feel the cause is hopaless with the Diem regime in power.
Others feel it bast to go aleng with the regime until a better one
appeare. The reporting has been, however, consistent and has
coincided with the views of Ambassador Nolting.

Within AID and USIA there have been strong differences
of opinios and the same is trus of the Embassy etaff. On the
ether hand, the military which is devoted to the single task of
defeating the Viet Cong, had turned its back on political problems
and concentrated on military problems and have bean stesdfast
in refusing to be deterred by internal political fasues.,

Many people have become highly emotional, have talked
too much and have given the impreesion of very deep splits.

4, Situation in the last several weeks.

| The Hue incident on May 8th was a serious setback tor the

Diem Government. The agreement with the Buddhists on June 16th was

“ decigned to traprove the situation. The agreement was never carried

out. Increasing agitation by the Buddhists culminated in the raids on the
pagodas on Auguet 2L Thies wae carried out apparently at the direction

of Nhu by the Special Forces, some of whem are in -he Saigon - Hye

S| deployed to the uorth and engaged in thelr regular assignments.

. The action on Auguet 21 broke the camel's back as far as those

in the United States Geverament who felt that the cause would be lest if

the Diem regime remained, Therefore, a cable was cent to the Ambagssdor
instructing him to insist on effective reforms including reducing the influence
and authority of the Nhus and if this could aot be accomplished by pereuasiba
te take such action as would accomplish this objective evon though it meant
The fault in this instruction wae that there existed at the time no

At this point CIA was asked by the Ambassador and General
_ Hagkins to query certain military leaders and te datermine whether the

uae
resentment had created a body of opinion among the military, the Security

Forces and the public that would carry off a coup and establish a new

| government, CIA reported this condition did not exist. During the week of

Auguat 26 and without taking a position as to whether the regime ebould or
should act be removed, the Agency urged care and deliberation. It pointed

. out that te act precipitously and without asaurance of eyecuss a civil war

would inevitably result, the war against the Viet Cong would be lest and
This position was highly exaaperating to those who wished to _

MEMORANDUM FOR: General Carter

You will note from the very brief memorandum of my
discussion with Secretary Rusk that he made two requests --
the first, a study of the reasons for lack of action of the
Communists in Southeast Asia, This is a matter I discussed
at this morning's meeting and I hope that we can have an OCI
memorandum on my return,

The second question was concerning clandestine channels
to Castro, the Chinese Communists and Hanoi. This should be
given serious thought by DDP. Each situation differs, Iam sure
we could, if we desired, open up a channel to Castro. The
Peiping and Hanoi situations are more difficult. In one respect
there is a channel open to Pgiping through Warsaw, but it is not
effective. Perhaps the[Taipei Stat ion would have some _thoughts
on this. Also, there is a channel to Hanoi through the Canadian)
representative on the ICC; however this obviously is an "official"
channel and is not very productive, I think it. would be well to
go over this matter with Dick Helms when he returns.

Secretary Rusk expects comments on both these points
next week,
