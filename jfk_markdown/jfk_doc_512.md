/On.'29 Novaiiber 1961-sIROSUS. told. the undersigned that he felt his - |. :
’ Yongolesé Government way rapidly weakening. Firat, my :
&-had.enddrsed sending one of the advisors wit the<Congolese Air. | . a to

- 40,000,000 available for aifplane purchasea “going, into soneoné’s.pocket.""
\ WIWOGJB was incensed ‘at the move of the GO in send @ parallel mission

‘to Europe and not informing him of ‘it. “He saw WIZARD/2 and asked about
‘this other mission. WIZARD/2 apparently informed WIZARD/4 about ° . ;
“WIR0GUS's visit and since then, for a period of the last five days, — - .

WIZaRD/4 hes refused to ase or talk to WIHOGUR. 7 Lot :

2. The GOC has also a ently proposed sending WIROGUE on an a
intelligence gathering rission to Katanga. WIkOGUE aaked if KUBARK were
' interested in this undertaking. We advised him strongly aryainat this .
. move and added we hud no interest whatsoever in the project.

3. WIZOGUE has also met the ODOATH representative and showed him
‘ _ the model submarine which was the subject of ACLA-630. The ODCATH

representative evinced interest in this model’ and through the ODUWIT
representative, who WIROGUE has seen on several occasions and discussed. - we
“the problem of purchasing planss for the GOS, the ODOATH representative . ~ Ds
wes aware that WIHOCUS has an Ordre da iission signed /by WIZARD/2 to ~- : an
travel to PAP.IMS. “He said for WIZ0GU8 to inform him when he was ready - :
to depart and he would arrange for WIROGUE to contgaot appropriate ODOATH

people in P3PRIKME to discuss tho model. .

: 4. WIROGUS approached GUTHMAN on November 24 ‘and SALVACK on November
29 with a réquest whether he might be of use to KUBARK either in Africa
or elsewhere in the worlds dnd that he would like to be taken’ back into
the fold. He is obviously concerned about his position in the GOC at this

_ time and feels with the diplozatic relations being established between
‘Belgium and the GOC that his position will become increasingly weeker. To
reenphasize past assessments of AIRCSUE, he is far too disorganized an
individual to be an effective FI agent but would probably be useful where
action is required but detailed accurate reporting is not. The station
agrees with an early statement made concerning WIHOGUS that he has a
peculiar turn of mind which lends itself remarkably to nefarious and”
extra-legal activities but would add that these activities should be of

an action type.
