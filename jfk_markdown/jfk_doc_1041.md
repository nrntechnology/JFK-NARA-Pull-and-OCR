Cuban financing of subversive operations in Latin

America is, easy to-ascertain and-wardto document. =

Our evidence shows that it is generally effected

by couriers carrying cash.

A.

A Venezuelan politician, Fabricio Ojeda, re-
turned from Cuba in March of 1962, and was seen

by several witnesses to have large quantities

. of US currency stuffed in a false-bottomed con- .

partment of his suitcase: There is no law
against bringing currency into Venezuela, so

that authorities could not even determine how

“much he had brought in. Ojeda later was cap-

tured, _ tried, and sentenced for guerrilla’ ac-

7 tivity.

A ‘Nicaraguan exile, “Julio Cesar Mayorga Porto
carrera, was ‘flying from Mexico to Honduras in
September, 1961, when weather forced the plane
to overfly Honduras and land in Nicaragua. He
was found to be carrying $3 ,600 in cash from
Cuba for Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras.

Last March Ecuadorean troops raided a guerrilla

training camp in the nouiltains west of Quito and

the group admitted having received guerrilla

training in Cuba, but there was’-no other evidence

at the time of any Cuban involvement. The URJE;

however, was a Communist-front group whose leaders

_had thrown off the discipline of the regular Com-.

munist party, and this January the Communists ‘man-

aged to have a URJE convention, run by Young Com-

.. munists, expel the leaders. They were accused,

_ according to published accounts, of having wasted

$44, 000 supplied by . Cuba for guerrilla activities.

“ One of our reliable sources in the Communist Party

, (a regional Communis t _ leader in contact. wit

Cuban chargé in Chile, anda menor of the. PCE

“anqui y conmission)) has informed us that the

: next-to-last Cuban chargé in Quito blamed the

fiasco on the fact that his successor had passed

"the money ‘to the URJE without coordinating with

_the regular” ‘Communist party.

A highly placed Guatemalan Communist who defected

- last November has given us a specific account of

procedures by which Cuba sent cash to Mexico to
buy weapons which were then smuggled into Guate-

mala.
