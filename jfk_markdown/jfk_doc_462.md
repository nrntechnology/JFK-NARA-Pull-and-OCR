*AMICE-3L invited to be delegate at ninth CLASC Consejo planned for
May 13-17 in Santo Domingo, A-31l could be useful as reporter
and/or action agent since he is opposed to CLASC alliance with
Marxist groups and in opposition to Emilio Maspero.
**Rased on recollection of A-3l's previous performance at Bogota
CLASC meeting, in which AMICE-31 seemed inclined to Maspero,
Caracas sees Little point in WOFIRM subsidizing A-S3l's trip this
. time, but defers action to Hqs and Santo Domingo.
