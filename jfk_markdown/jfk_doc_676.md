learned the following information with the dates and sources as
indicated.

2. AMRAZZ-) spoke on 31 January 1965 with Sergio (LNU) who had
just reached Miami from the Dominican Republic. Sergio stated that
GUTIERREZ had gone to Cuba with three other men on 20 December 1964,
landing near Baracoa, Orieate. The only members in this first infil» -

base by radio on 31 December 1954, but no message was ever received.
Plans called for another group of about seven gen to infiltrate into

Dominican Republic on 20 January according to plan. Near the Cuban

was called the “Botrand" which may moan a Bortram boat.

3. ABRAZZ-1 reported on 1 February that he had spoke en 31 Jan

@igmantling the base there. He also needed about $10,000.00 to clear
up back bills owed by the group. Eowever, on 3 February 1965, AMDELL-1
reported AMRAZZ-1 had again spoken to Reynaldo ABREU who declared the
menbers of GUTIERREZ’ group in the Dominican Republic intended to go
