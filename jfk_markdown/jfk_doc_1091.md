MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT Ou fp

Subject : Your Meeting with President Lopez Mateos -°“\

We do not expect to make any major political decisions
but want to give new emphasis to the friendly relations
which exsist between Mexico and the United States. These
relations are now at an all-time high. Mexico felt it had
a real friend in President Kennedy. They feel the same
relationship exsists with you but want to be reassured.

A warm Texas handshake and abrazo when you greet Lopez Mateos
at Los Angeles would symbolize the continuance of that

relationship. Pee!

We want to stress the identity of interests of our

two countries and sur ability to work out in the "spirit
of El Chamizal" any problems: that may arise between us.

Despite the informal atmosphere of the visit, we
should give scrupulous attention to Mexico's extreme
sensitivity on sovereign equality and Mexico's strong
desire to avoid-any appearance of subservience to. the
United States © . ’ ne ee

“Lopez Mateos speaks for the Mexican Government

and no important decision is made without his approval.
He“has followed an "independent" foreign policy but

knows that good relations with us, especially in the
economic sphere, are essential to his country... At. times
his foreign policy has. been too independent®-for °™
example-on Cuba and in' commercial and cultural rela-

tions with Communist China. But when fundamental issues 22
are at stake we have usually found him understandin

and willing to be helpful--controlling travel of

Castro’ agents, non-recognition of Red China, offering

help on Panama. we ;
'.... Lopez Mateos has chosen his successor, Gustavo DIAZ
Ordaz, who Will take office in December 1964 after

elections in July. Power. is therefore drifting toward

EE LOS

We -desita to continue elose working relations with
Mexico both within and outside the OAS and the UN.-...

‘We -hope'Mexico will continue to use its key political

.and geographic position to help control Castro Communism.
Mexico is ver Sensitive about publicizin its cooperation

. €nd-we have carefully avoided any 7 ublic comment on Mexican
control measures. . Se oe Se

“Mexico has offered its assistance on Panama. Mexico

is not aware of the role of President Orlich of Costa Rica
in mediation efforts and we do not desire that this come to
Mexico’s attention. We welcome Mexico's assistance within
an OAS context. - : ; ood

2.- Red China’:
: The coming visit of De Gaulle to Mexico and Brazil. in
March has prompted speculation that. these two countriés
are about to recognize Red China. “Lopez Mateos has given
us secret assurances, through’ CIA channels, that he has

no intention of recognizing Red China. We do not desire
to raise this issue, but. if Lopez Mateos raises it, we

shou et him know we are aware of his assurances,

_3. Mexico's Role in the Iliance for Progress

to its success, Mexico has played a leading role in IA-
ECOSOC and ‘has ‘named the Directér General of the Bank of -
Mexico as its representative to CIAP. . It has cooperated |.
with us in providing extensive’ training facilities for
Latin’ American technicians. ° We want to encourage Mexico to
make a greater contribution. Mexico is making renewed efforts

4. Disputed Tracts on Rio Grande

There remain several tracts on the Rio Grande over
which sovereignty is in dispute. We desire to have the
International Boundary anid Water Commission study these
problems dnd recommend a solution.

5. Control of Narcotiés

Mexico and the United States are cooperating in
controlling the importation of narcotics and dangerous
drugs into the United States. We should strengthen this
cooperation in the mutual interest of both countries, We
; : hope therefore that Mexico will agree to periodic meetings
-of the highest law enforcement officers of the two countries.

6. Desalinization Plant_at Tijuana

An appraisal report by Interior shows that this is
the most economical way to supply water to Tijuana. We
are prepared to go ahead with a feasibility study if
Mexico desire and will share the cost.

MAJOR POINTS LOPEZ MATEOS IS EXPECTED TO RAISE

1. Salinity Problem on Lower Colorado

The Mexican President wants a reaffirmation of ,
President Kennedy's commitment "to reach a permanent and
effective solution at the earliest possible time" of the
salinity problem. We can agree but should avoid any commit-
ment on timing. If Lopez Mateos raises the related problem
of the groundwater recovery program at Yuma, we agree that
the Boundary Commission should study the problem. Farmers
in the lower Rio Grande Valley are seriously concerned
about saline drainage discharged to the river by Mexico and

want the Boundary Commission to achieve an early solvtion. to
this problem.

2. Bracero Program

The Mexican Government is privately seriously
disturbed about the termination of this program.
Congressional oppostion to it is strong and we cannot
commit ourselves to continue’ the program. We are looking

ni i anything can be done to help
Mexico. One possibility is an expanded community develop-
ment program in Mexico through private channels (P.L. 480

foodstuffs through U.S. voluntary agencies) if Mexico is
interested.

3. Mexico's Concern about U.S. Trade Policies

Mexico is concerned about United States restrictions

or threatened restrictions on textiles, lead, zinc and
meat and other products and United States cotton policies
which it claims hurt Mexican cotton exports to the world
market. We recognize that we are natural markets for

_ each other. We desire to expand trade, promote competi-
tion and develop markets. We want to maintain or expand the
present level of access to each other's market but we would
not be able to guarantee Mexico its present share of our

4. Chamizal Settlement

Lopez Mateos wants to be recorded in history as the
man who returned *«*e Mexican flag to the Chamizal. He
wants a ceremony gt the Presidential level at El Paso-
Ciudad Juarez before December 1964 to symbolize the Chamizal
settlement. We should only agree to consult later in the
year on an appropriate céreémony and a possible date.
