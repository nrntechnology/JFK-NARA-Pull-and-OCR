SUBJECT: Court Foster Wood

[Michael Weimer Stratton} has recently advised that Court £
Foster Wood was a relatively close high school friend of Stratton):

Virginia, during 1957 to 1959.

_during mutual attendance at 3. [Stratton High School, Falls Churéh,
S

tratton] described Wood as an
ad no particular ‘problems with
the exception that there were domestic difficulties between the
father and mother of Wood.

{St#atton]became acquainted with the parents of Wood and made
occasional visits to their home during the above period of time.
The father of Wood, Foster Wood, is an attorney who was then living
in Falls Church. Some time ago the father and mother of Court Wood
split up and Court Wood and father moved into an apartment on
Columbia Road, Washington, D.C. .

(SePatton) advised that after graduation from high school in
June 1959 he lost any close contact with Wood who then started to
attend George Mason College, where he seemed to have an interest
in philosophy.$ Stratton\ started to attend a_ military school and
Wood expressed extreme Opposition to military schools. >

(Stvactoa married in 1960, which also helped to nove [Stratton]}
somewhat out“of the social circle of Wood. TStractog) bet feved that
for approximately a year, during 1959 to 1960, he did not actually
see Wood but advised that after this period.in which he did not
see Wood he has had a number of contacts with Wood, many of which
occurred during mutual attendance at the University of Virginia
Extension School (night school) in early 1961. On one occasion

{Stratton} attended a party at the apartment occupied by Wood and

‘father St the invitation of Wood, and on. this occasion came into
contact with the "new set of friends" of Court Wood, whom [Stratton] $
described as being "beatnik_types." Girls in. attendance at the
party, according to[ Stratton}, appeared to be of the "street pickup"

type. : . 3 .

After the above party Wood occasionally ‘telephoned [Strattoal>
and about Christmas 1960 Wood called and stated that he was going
to Cuba_under the auspices of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
Stratton) called on Wood after the return of Wood from Cuba and at
that time Wood lauded Castro very highly. The father of Wood was

“also present and|StrattonPobtained the impression that the father

was also in sympathy wit Castro. S{Stratton) recalled that he again,
at a later date, had visited the Wood apartment, this being an
occasion when Wood had been visiting somewhere in Falls Church
and contacted [Stratton] to ask Stratton }to take Wood home. On this
