Clémard Joseph CHARLES

President and General Manager 7 :
of the Commercial Rank of Haiti

Clémard Joseph Charles, a man who has
incisted on numerous occasions.that he will
be the next President of Haiti, has been
chronically involved, directly or indirect~
ly, in rumored plots against President ~ §

-Duvalier which have never materialized.
In May 1963 Charles is reported to have
Passed word to US officials through an
4merican journalist that he was in a
position to head a provisional govern-
ment after President Duvalier had been : i
kemoved from power. In subsequent years, particularly in 1966. i
and 1967, Charles approached US officials both in New York oy i
and Port-au-Prince with the apparent intention of enlisting 7 no
US suppore for a group of conspirators he claimed to lead. fo .
which was determined to topple Duvalier from power. None ~ “oe | ae

of these plots materialized, however, and there was never |
any evidence to suggest that any serious plans had been made,

: “In Januavy 1969 Charles had a lengthy conversation with

"an official of the US Enbassy in which the former candidl =

that representatives of these groups had already agreed on.

Charles changed his statements about being "the next

to be placing some distance between himself and the pro- - :

During Charles' eforementioned conversation with an uo Ts et t:

of his personality as well as his penchant for plotting. - - — .
He conceives of his role in Haiti in grandiose, almost - Sy 7
messianic terms. He said that he had invested $2 million a an H
in Haiti and had done more-for the development of the ” : i |
country than any other indigenous Haitian, He claimed,

the country's secondary cities. To achieve these goals.
before current trends become irreversible, Charles believes
that it is essential to pursue relations. with the United

In a period just. prior to June 1967 Duvalier was convinced by Desinor and
Boyer that Charles waa, or at least had been, plotting Duvaliers' over-

throv. Together with dearge group Charles was. imprisoned an Port-eu-Frinve
from June 1967 to June 1968. :

Just prior to the arrest of Caarles, Max Rowe's wife, Raymonde, took
Us$200,000 out of the bank and hid it near Cap Haitien in th north and - .

Charles is hopeful. that, when puvalier's, overthrow has been completed he
will be able to get’ private financial assistance from the US. According

2. in June 1967, Charles was arrested in Port-au-Prince

veleaced at various intervals by Duvalior apparently to give him —
the opportunity to locate more money for the regime. . Since . -

to get the required sn: into Haiti and at the eane tint to ensure

that it vould not sliply ve confiscated Ly the GOH. The idea
wes born because Charles and his friends relt (and still feel)
that 4¢ he elaply handed over US}605 thousand be'would then
be liquidated. Thus, the BCH schene vould serve as a sort of
dnsurence policy on Charles‘ life. On the other hand, it is
possible that the OOH would sefuse to accept the BUH scheme
ao oa substitutes sora direct payaent and would continue to

‘Qneiet on the direct payment of the Us$o05 thousand ag ransane

It 1s possible, hovever, for the’ following reseons that hes-
ident Duvalier would consent to the DCH scheme. .Piret, he is:
@ospernte for nonay and does not much care in just what. fom

46 may enter Haiti. Second, he approsches his. provlens on a
@ny-to-day basis and dees not plan tur Lito the future. . Third,
he io obsessed vith the idea of retaining power for life, Nov,
Duvalier ita perrectly vell avare, Iam sure, that tha BCH schene:
will not net his U&$605 thousand. On the www lmnud, however,
he fe quite anxious for foreign investors to place their money
in Haiti, both for the economic benefits which such investaents
WAl2 bring to Edt and aleo fur the propaganda value vhich s.
new foreign vusinese vill bring to him. If he liquidates .
Guarles, either before or after receiving the thousand,
be will suffer nuch unfavorable publicity. It ie possible, too,

hat he may talnk that he may be able to get his hands.on the

thousand even though it amy be tied up. in the BCH:
echeme. in any event, Charles is, I believe, going to mke

those who were forced out of the country for political reasons or other-

My latest Visit to Haiti took place on, June Sth of this ycar and I

“ stoyed two days in Port-au-Prince, Aitheugh the purpose of ny Arips

were mostly business I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitjan — 7

political situation with politicians, as well as with aversce Haitian
-. @dtizens concerned with the situetion, yy personal conclusions are 6s
fJows: . . :

The fact is that the Duvalicr regima is, at prescit, ina state or
internal political confusion in. vh! ch no one. directly or indirectly con-
; tected with it cen predict the outcome, There ia stroug evidence showing
_ that his son-in-law, Colonel Max Dominique, has.in fact tried to overthrow
, Davalier in order to personally assure the direction of Haiti's political
affairs. How Duvalier became aware of Colonel Dominique's intentions is
: the question everybody is trying te find the answer to. “Nevertieless,
.Duvalier rounded up the alledged associates of Colonel Dominique ani,
: ‘after @ wock cours martlal accusing ond convineing 19 young amy efticors
‘ of. treason they were all killed by a firing squad on Sune 8, 19¢7 at
a Fort Dinanche on the outskirts of Port-au-Prinee. Duvalfor Aimaalt yas
“present at the slaughter and he ordered Col. Dominique to be a member of
‘the firing squad. Noneconfirmed information from usually rallable suurces

”

Ancicates thas several other persons, low ras: .ing nilitery personnel,
“\mtlitde men and civilians were also executed or sdwiler charges, without
fanfare. Jt is-ulso the general ‘concensus of opinion that the. "purge"
will continue at a rate that. no one ean yet deteraine, - :
sto one ignores: that there has been and st412 are very hostile feelings:
between’ wwo” Groups within the President's family ard close associates.
One is headed vy Colonel Dominique and his wife Marie-Denise Davelier,
_ ond another ‘is ded by i es.” Yvon St.Vietor, the President's: .private: sen
" eretary ani confidunte. The nanes of the President's wife, Simone, his.
son Jean-Claude and his younger daughter Sinone, are ethy- neriticned as:
being part of the first Group. ‘In ‘the second group, Urs. St.Vistor's
brother, the, present Head of the Departnent of Tourisn, Nr. Luc-Albert i
oucard, wi who is. also married to one of the Prestaunt's daughter, is among \
other nanes such as Henri Sielait, head of. the Regie, Minister Lebert |
Jn.Pierre, etc. mentioned to be siding with Mrs. St.Victor. ‘So far, the
". President has showa signs that he favers.the latter group. The ranifica- :
".tdons of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fanatic %.
-/ Sapporters of Duvalier hinself, The fact 1s that none of the renaining
" so-called strong men of Duvafier in the militia, the ‘Tonton Macoutes or -
_- the’ Arity know for sire how the. president fcels towards them and are, very ,
mien conceried about their om fiture and survival. In other words, ;
‘confusion and ineeccurity are wide spread amongst Davalier's followers.
. I valieve thet in spite of the.actual confusion ‘and sense of insecurity
prevailing in government circles, there is no real organized opposition

‘as Buch Ocainst Divalicr at, this moment, except for what I will point out.
later ‘in. thia paper. _

There is, however, - strong antieluvalicr feclings in the middie and .
upper classes of Haiti, roprosenting: only @.emall percentage of the whole
population, A segment of the population to be taken into vory serious

Deotel Ficnole's followers, ean be swung to any movesent and play a

. ‘portunity to’ swing that scetor in their favor, whenever a serious at- \ :
_ tempt to overthrow Duvalier is made, whether by then or anyone’ else. ,
Under those circumstances, Duvalier loosing his old grip on key.
_@lements comaitted to his support, a large portion ofswhich he has
recently liquidated, is trying to instore a new politicsl philosophy ~
reaching out for elements of the middle cluss a. sll as. those of the >
slum areas mentioned above. «I have a focling that the new philosophy ‘is
aimed at antegonizirig the U.S. Government for its hands-off policies and
‘the econoaic squeeze applied by the U.S, against his government. This
entagonisa will go as far as necossary cven.to an almost impossible al-
” Utenee sith communist countries such as Cuba or other communist nations
of Burope, Africa or Asia, As evidence of that direction in Duvalier's
" Government, he has allowed the so-called "Little Red Book". of Chainzan’
‘+ Mao-See-Tung of Communist China to airculate freely in Haiti, whercas
\ previously the suse took was banned end neized in local libruiries ond
JRevastezds in Haiti. “Several articles appearing in local Haitian nows-
popars have lately referred with much emphasis to the "Cultural. Revolution" :
of Davolier which has. yet to take place. The appointment in his newly :

. In connection with the possibiiity of Sinding a political leader,

as indicated above, I must say that I have been in contact with a man
whom, I feel, could very well. i: 1 the position. His name is Clérard _
Joseph Chazles, President of Ba. :e Commerciale d'iaiti, President of —
Eeiti's Cnanmber of Commerce, a c..ccter of several other business and
industrial organizetions in Haivi.

I have known <r. Charles sinc: 1951. ke have been friends and .

on the besis of his close cooperation witn the Duvalier regime. I have
nyself, sonetimes, felt.that he went too far. I have also told ‘hin SO,
Bany times. His- answers on such occasions Rave, most of the tine, satisfy
my own judgenent. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, Knowing Duvalier, *.) | - .

. as he knows him, it would have been a question of life or death if he
were to behave in a different mannez>.. What would his death serve if he
” jad taken a position of non-compromise? He feels that ih order to be: ~

““in" than “out"™ or to put it another way to be alive than dead. _ Tecan.

Eversince f nave known Mr, Chaves, he has civays ‘gold me of his

it has cost me some: of my friends, I have extonded to him everything that

where, lixe a miracle, the country will asain tae its course forward
to join the ether srocressive nations of this hexisphere.

now prevailing in Haiti. : : of - . . .

vations ere purely patriotic watle I en also moved by a sinc exe desire . : -

to éee Waiti emerge as o azmocratic independent nation friendly to the ° ™ ’

oe Since I left Haiti with my fanily ten years ago to later. become en i t

: fooravnn citizen, T have nade several trips to Haiti and’have maintained oY
close contects with people in all walks of life both in Haiti and with
those wno were forced out of the country for political reasons or other.

"wise. : Le

My latest visit to Haiti took place’ on June 5th of this year and I

(. stayed two.days in Port-au-Prince. Altncugh the purpose of my trips

*. were mostly buainess I also hed the opportunity to discuss the Haitian

/ political situation with politicians, as well as with average Haitien
_ citizens concerncd with the situation, Ny personal conclusions are as

follows: .. - os a .

Me fact fe thet the ‘puvalior rogize is, at _ present, ine state of... &

internal politienl confusion in which no one directly or indirectly. cone >

nected with it can predict the-cutcoan. There is strong evidence ehowing -
thet his son-in-law, Colonel Max Dominique, has in fact tried to overthrow

Duyalier in order to personally assume the direction of Haiti's political

affairs, Yow Duvalier became eware of Colcne) Dominique's intentions is},

the question everybody te trying to find the answer to. ‘Nevertheloss,

Duvalier rounded up the alledged associntes ot Colonel Dominique and,

efter a wock court martial eecusing and convincing 1$ young amy officers

of treason they wore ‘all killed ty a firing squad on cune 8, 1967 at .

Fort Dimanche on the cutskirte of PorteauePrince. Duvalier himself was -

present at the slaughter and he ordered Col. Dominique to bea member of

‘the firing squad; Non-confirmed information from woually rollable sources

me 8

cheer epi te Hee AEM

14-00000

indicates that several other persons, low ranking military personnel,

militia men ané civilians were also executed on similar charges, without
fanfare.

ae

Yt is also the general concensus of oj inion that the "purge"
will continue at a rate that.no one can yet determine. ;

se,

“ato one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile’ feelings
detween two groups within ‘the. President's family and close associates.

One is headed by Colonel Dominique and his wife Marie-Denise Duvalier,

and another is led by yrs. Yvon St.Victor, the President's private se- :
erctary and confidante, The nanes of the President's wife, Simone, his“
son Jean-Claude and his younger daughter Simone, are being mentioned as ‘
Ddeing part of the first group. In the second group, Mra. St.Victorts ©
brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Mr. Lue-Albert
Foucard, who is also married to one of the President's daughter, is among
éther names such as Henri Siclait, head of the Regie, Minister Lebert \.’
dn.Pierre, ett. nentioned to be siding with Mrs. St.Victor. So far, the a
President has shown Signs that he favers the latter group. The ‘yamifica- ‘

-tions of both groups extend to people who were considered the most fanatic
supporters of Duvalier hinself.

The fact is that none of the remaining
,8e-ealled strong men of Duvalier in the militias, the Tonton ‘Macoutes or

the Army know for sure how. the president feels. towards _them ond are ve: “
: euch concerned about their own future and survival. . tn ‘other “‘yoras,.° -

7 Haiti and some commnist countries. ‘The most significant one is the new i

appointment in Haiti of an Anbassador from Polend with vhon,I was told, F
Duvalier is closely working with.

| Taking everything into consideration: *

“1. The non existence of any organized opposition in Haits;

2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust amongst the exiled
political elements abroad, therefore muliitying any positive action. trom
outside Haiti; :

3. Tne fear of local politicians that, if outside forces were to come °
in, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they

: : should resist such intervention and do whatever is necessary to prevent
fe eb all cost; . co :

3. The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.S. is not working

- 6, The interpretation of the above classes which arc at a loss tq unders

tand the silence of the U.S. press in general for “not having raised the ~.

‘for the belief of a possible collusion. by means of money or otherwise of

It would be childish, however, to formulate an opinion only on the
basis of the mentioned facts, although on the surface, they appear
Logical enough to confirm these conclusions.-

I am convenced in my own mind, ‘that when some politicians’ close to ‘
Duvalier will feel that their lives are. in real danger, some of then
will successfully attempt to eliminate him even though they mey not be,
thexselves, in a position to control the chadtic situation that will ne=
eessarily follow. This is where the real danger is. If any such un=
plenried action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find itself
with a real “hot potato", requiring such drastic action similar to those:
takin in 1965 during the recent crieis-in the Dominicon Republic. Such \

‘.” aetions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the ,
“- Amexgean taxpayers, but because they incvitably provoke strong anti=
fmerican feelings based on the opinion that the U.S. did nothing to help
bring about the collapse, but ie merely there to impose its choice and
- G@ecisions against the will of the people,

If the U.S, is to wait for the.
OAS to decide on joint action in the eventuality of chaos, we are afrald

that communist influence and even control of. the Situation by forces 2
based in Cuba and other countries, will make.1t mich more: difficult to, ;
(Gope with within the context of cur national security. It fe, therefore,
imperative, in our opinion,.that the U.S. take sone steps towards working -
with local politicians to take: the initiative of a coup which, when per=.
formed, would receive the. strong backing of this country, militarily,
financially and othervise, to secure an orderly succession of the present

regime. As far as Haiti is concerned, I feel that I have: the most adequate
elution for the proposed action.

T feel that whenever the security of
this nation or any” ‘nation is concerned, there ie no time for Walt~and-6ee

“@eneiderations., In the case of Haiti, in particular, where the politica.
-goene is really deprived of individuals of strong convictions,. one way oF.
:the other, wo feel that the U.S. should not have eny problem in finding
 gemeone that they can build politically and work with in a sincere and .
loyal effort to help that small nation solve some of ite perennial problens.

In connection with the possibility of finding a political leader, .
@s indicuted above, I must say that I have been in contact with a man
whom, I feel, could very well 1 the position. “Mis name is Clémard
Joseph Chavles, President of Ba: :@ Commerciale d'iaiti, President of.
Haiti's Chaaber of Commerce, a u..cetor of several other ‘business ands a .
industrial organizations in Haiti. ° .

_ 2 have known Mr.‘ Charles since 1951. We have. been: friends and .

“ business associates evarsince. To me, Mr. Charles is a true and sincere
patriot. Of course, today, a number of people question his patriotism
on the basis of his close cooperation with the Duvalier regime. I have.

"myself; sometimes, felt that he went too far. I have.alco told him so, 7
many tinés. His answers.on such occasions have, most of the tine, satisfy, nae
my own judgement. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, knowing Duvalier,
‘as he knows him, it would have been a question of life or death if he :

" were to behave in a different manner, What would his death serve if he
hed taken a position of non=-compromise? He feels that in order to be
edie. to control the situation and outlive Duvalier, it was better to be

LL "in" ‘then “out or to put it another way to be alive than-dead... I-can .
that on several occasions, was it.not for Mr. Charles'. influence on
Duvalter, . this latter would have done’ more “harm to: the Poor pelple of.
Baits ’ “dn general, then he has done eo far. .
IZ have always maintained a dialogue with Mr. Charles and “passed on w
nin as much as possible the Judgements of Haitians and others with vhom
had no direct contact. I must say that I have alvaye find hin reo
ceptive to their opinions, >

Everaince I have known Mr. Charles, he hes alvaye ‘told me of nis ,

a bitiens ‘and determination to be a. great Haitian. He asked me to ‘never

‘det him down and to stay with nim to help him carry.out his dream. Though

“ ‘haa cost me sane of my friends, I hove extended to hia. everything that -

2 gould possibly offer to help him roach his goals. © . _

Unlike whe.majority of iluition politiefans, Mr: Charles hee an-un- - -

gurmonteble faith in the future of his coudtry. He féele that if Heitt, |
under ‘Duvaltor, has sonsiderably regressed in every ways the time. will cone

where, lixe a miracle, the country will acain take its course forward

_ to Join the other progressive nations of this hemisphere. Unlike those
politicians who have soen their prominent positions as a temporaty state
of affairs with absolutely no future beyond Duvalier, Mr; Charles has
practically invested in Waitt almost all the wealth that he has eccumile~ |
ted before and during Duvolier's reign through genuine: efforts and elf...
Alecipline. Of course, I will: arait. that his wealth would not have . sO
increased in its prosent proportion if it ves not for Duvalier's favors

to him. Dut who clse under the previous regimes who were in the same - . fe
position have genuinely directed thelr efforts in using their gains for 4
the betterment of the people? I have always find that Mr. Charles took ‘ '
very much satiefaction in giving employment and assistace to as ‘many
people as he possibly could. As a matter of fact this is one ‘of his
biggest assets in his present struggle. . . ne :

Mr. Charles is not a demagogue. Ie believes in the realities of the
modern world, He realizes that without the assistance of the U.S.,
progress ic impossible for ‘Kaiti. He sincerely believes in the epirit.
of the Alliance for Progress. Having traveled extensively, he is fully
" Q@vare of the tragic state of stagnation in. which his country 4a in. He
“~ Qeeply wishes to see Haiti make some progress in the. fields of human
~. Qtgnity, education, technology and above all, Freedon.-

Now, if we ‘are to take. tor granted, ny ; epintons, what does: Me. Charles .. .
shave to offer to the.U.8. to prevent the chaos that will neceszerily
"follow: Duvalior's downfall?. First of all,-Mr. Charles is et present -

" weady and willing to provoke the desired collapse of Duvalier's vegine.
‘This, he accured ma, he aon do without any. outside eastetencs. 2 ae

Rot he go ahead and-make it, you may ask? His reply is that should : an ’
ho make it, what abaurances docs he have that ‘his action will satisfy °. oa ot _t
the U.3,. As I stated before, Mr. Charles feele that without United
States backing, no government can possibly exist in Haiti except. undor
the very some conditions of Duvalier's Government. There would be no - °
Feason to precipitate a change at Haiti were to romain: under a *yronical a
_ Qietatorship like Duvalier's..- - wos p>
What Mr. Charles is asking as a prerequisite of any ‘aetion to be -
sponsored or initiated by him is the assurance from a person of established
authority in the U.S, Government that the United States will support. the
provisional government that will necessarily hove to -asaure power after q
Duvalier, . - \ Done
‘Me dispositions taken ‘by Mr. Charles are that. e. ntlivery coup by . * 7 :
dunta will take over and stay in power until free elections. are held. ‘the
: | mombers of that military junta have been already. selected by Mr. Charles,
who has their commitments to that effect. Mr. Charles beliove that if
_ tree elections are hold he ‘should not have any great difficulty in seine
“Ate. plans and programs to the people: and therofore-ba’ @lacted the next —
a president. of Haiti. In my opinion, Mr. Charles is noe. aaking too ‘much.

: : Should the United States consent to his request in” the form’ mentioned
above, I feel that the. Haitian situation, long a sore rote in the U.S.
“RomLepheric relations, could be changed without risk aor ell parties
“eoncerned;

Why should the United States gamble on any other calculated risk.
waile I feel, it oan wrap up the situation safely in accord with Mr.Charies!/
plane? The military junta proposed by Mr. Charles will.be made up by high
ranking officers of the Haitian army loyal to hin, therefore on the side
of the U.G. With U.S. assistance = it is almost impossible. othe:wise = the
ateps proposed by Mr. Charles after the junta will take over are. as follows:
2. Dioarm the Militia and the Tonton Macoutes immediately) .

4. Provent the return to the Haitian political econe of such "rabble-.
rouser" so-called leaders as Daniel Fignole and Henri Vixamar;

5. Star. the ground work for free elections as soon as possible,
Mr. Charles feels that although it will probably te impossibie to pre=
vent acts of reprisals ‘during the first 72 hours of the mili:ary take,

’ ver, strong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary: bloodshed, ©

Mr. Charhes, in my opinion, is-one of the few individuals around whom
@ reconciliation of all the social’ divisions ané subdivisions of the
Haitian family can: be achieved.

_ I will mention some of the basic reasons
behind this opinion: °

1. He is of modest rural extraction, therefore is what is called in
Weiti a “son of the masses"; . :

2. He is black, therefore representing the vest najority of the’
Haitian people who, at this point, considers the light-skin Haitian as
‘a threat for the return of the domination of the mulatto minority;

3. He is deprived of the prejudice of color, therbfore tha milatto

_@ured that it will not be persecuted solely on the basis of the color ot”
-their skins;

'§. He is known to ve a hard, Intelligent Andustrieltot and aéninise

* trator capable of promoting and encouraging the establichnent: of new,

right of the individual to live without fear within the ) framework of the
‘Jaws of the land; :

8. Being a businessman in his own right, tho business community with | :
which he has dealt through the Chamber of Commerce and his bank will
alvays have a dialogue with hin and therefors will find him receptive ©
to their suggestions and endeavours; .

9. Having dealt with elements of the actual regime who huve his |
confidence, he will. be able to control them in a way which will avetd
unnecessary hardships should someone else = a complete stranger to then
be in a position of Government leadership; = © |

20. He is know to be strongly anti-commnist and yro-Aneriesn, ‘theres
fore opening the door to close cooperation with the United States, under
the doctrine of the Alliance for Progress, to. promote better understanding :
and opportunities for the Haitian. people with the help of. the United. \

11. He will welcome the return of all Raitien exiles to take their a
Place anew within the Haitian commnity and to work with him to the task

of making the country e safer and better place to live; .
12. He does not contemplate any reprisals or even sanctions agatast

present end future for those vho vant to. Live in Haiti.

“Tne task, if and when he ‘succeeds to gain power, will. not be an easy”
I am sure, howaver,, that Mr, Charles will be able to find the supe
