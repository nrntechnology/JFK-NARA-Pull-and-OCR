1. Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of
concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known
Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City. The Station
in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such
coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail-
able for assignment to these targets. As lieadquarters is aware, thie Station
can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high :

enough priority to cover.

2. For éxample, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1956, 1957,
1960 and 1901; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue

the coverage.

3.._ Presently, Elena VASQUEZ Gomez, one of th: persons referred
oe ~~" tS in reference, works for General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio, pro=
Communist former President of Mexico. Coverage of CARDENAS by
LIENVOY means a certain amount of coverage of VAS\.UEZ Gomea,

(Audio Operation)

: 1. PY/INt files contain 37 positive information
disseminations attributed wholly or in part to Project LIPEAT

during the year 1 July 191 through dune 1%2. They were concerned _..

principally with contacts betwoen Mexican Cossunists or leftists

and Cubans or individuals of tho Sovict Bloc, and.with the travel

of Latin Americans to the Soviet Bloc and Cuba. Six reports of
particular interest consleted of information on Transcontinental S.A.,
@ company allegedly engaged in tho illegal transshipment of US goods
to Cuba. Other reports of significance dealt with the contacts and
activities of former Guatemalan President Juan Jose AREVALO Barneja,

now. living in Mexico. Thore was reporting on Kicaraguan and Spanish — .

exile activity in Mexico and on tho revolutionary sentiment and
expectations of other Latin American nationals.

2. LIFEAT has provided positive intelligence of value and of
relevance to customer requirements and to objectives of the PNIO.
It has been pointed out in the renewal request that the production
of positive information is incidental to the projects primary function
as @ support and CI/CE operation.

PROJECT REVIEW

I. Product of the Project

A, Soviet Coverage : an

As noted In last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage
of the offictal Sovict listallatton was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the
parallel Malson project LIENVOY assumed coverage of thts target, In early
January 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the
most active Soviet Intelligence officers, This wag in response to the con-

: .  tinuing Station Cl program which includes the monitoring of Sov let contacts,

; . and the guidance received from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT

- renewal, Ags of this date, thls coverage bas not been active for sufficlent
time to fully evaluate its usefulness, However, It is belleved that such
coverage has the potential to add materially to the Station's effort in the Cl
field, Although not designed to provide positive Intelligence, some by-product |
of thls type has been obtained, Samples are as follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journalist
by Soviet Embassy)

HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)

HMM-6376, 11 May 1962(Refutatton of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut
TITOV will visit Mexico)

B. Polish Embassy

LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the
only successful,. continuing penetration of the target. The information provided
to the Interested Case Offtcer has in the pas: been described as “unique” and
"invaluable", This description holds with equal emphasis for the present as
well as the past, Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence pro-
duct of this coverage are; :

Cc. Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was abie to provide coverage of major firms dealing in.U-S; goods
transshipment vila Mexico to Cuba, This technical operation aot only pro~
vided Initlal leads which alerted the Station to these companies, but also
was able to provide continuing Information on the dally activities of the com-
panies Involved, Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for illegal

corey meme ee transshipment of U.S, goods to Cuba was also provided including their con-

; , tacts and general activities, Samples of the posttlve intelligence Production

from this Cuban commercial coverage are as. follows: .

D. ‘American Communists in Mexico

‘As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the
‘request of ODENVY, and the raw-take has been partlally processed by them,
During the period Juty 1961 through May 1962, approximately 680 reels of
fake were passed :o local ODENVY for their processing, The most valuable
information gleaned from the targets in this fleld continues to deal with con-
tacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communisc Group in
Mexico (ACGM).

Exile and Revolutionary Activities

LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revoluttonary groups
-active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Station and

not avallable from other sources, The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this

area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more

recently Spanish Republican exiles, The product has been most rewarding in this

coverage, Examples of productivity tn this past project year:

By its latest Related Mission Direct Ive, | Mexico City Station's major respon-

- provide a-valuable contribution in the attainment of the Station's objectives. tn

acting in a covert liaison capacity between the CP and the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City, Besides the continuing operational support it in the cl CE field,
the following Informational reporting was provided:

Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City
Station through production of leads unobtainable through other assets and gen-
erally providing other Station operations the secure support only available
through a unilateral telephone tap operation, Th2 following is a selected list,
together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational support
and leads provided through LIFEAT:

14-0000

LIFEAT/Cuban: ‘The.n most noteworthy LIFEAT. contribution to Station efforts
in the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the acti-
vities of Transcontinental, S.A. in the illegal transshipment of U.S. materials
to Cuba via Mexico. LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities
of this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself ta the Mexican
business community ‘by changing the name ‘it operated under to Inversiones
Mexicanas, S.A. and changing its location and telephone number, Valuable
information on the commercial. commoditles needed by the Castro regime, __
methods and contacts used in their procurement. and information on the con-”
tacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained,

LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech
intelligence officers proyided some leads to their coatacts, but more impor-
tantly, provided greater security to KUBAR K when oie of their ‘EIS officers,
Miloslav CECH, was singled out for a defection attempt, . Through LIFEAT
“livemonitoring” cf both the original and followup defection attempts, the
KUBARK assets were provided maximum protection from possible atrempts

by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapmeat of the KUBARK per-
sonnel Involved,

: LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the mos: classic” example of the use of a telephone

tap in providing a tead which could develop into a vital peaetration of the Polish
intelligence occurred recently in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation, LIFEAT
provided the initial leads ‘which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an
operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's develop-
ment of the operation, It is the S:ation’s opinion that this one instance of service
by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire project for the year, (Full
information forwarded in MEXI 0462 and MEX1 0463), Also of great interest

to the Scation were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ,
Attache of the Polish Embassy, in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which
had been stolen in the U.S, and driven to Mexico. In this operation, in which

a defection attempt was cousidered, LIFEAT provided no: only the initial leads,
but also daily operational information vital to the Station's efforts in this case,

LIFEAT/ Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is
providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against thi8 target.
Since the Station is sxpanding its coverage of Yugoslavian activities, much viral
data on personalities, contacis. and services obtained by the target establish-
ment must be provided, It is this exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared
to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this
coverage progresses. The interested case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only
present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and will

TL Ld

oe

, continue to, provide in this area is Vital and basic to the mounting of any
operations : against the Yugoslay target. :

LIFEAT/Soviet /Double ‘Agent! “LIFEAT support has provided needed sup- .
porting information in backing Station double agent operations, In this area
-the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the
agent. CIFEAT provides’ information which enables the interested case; -
officer to determine the veracity of the agent involved, LIFEAT also provides
a needed check upon the activities of the double agent,

LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: ‘LIPEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles

in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activities of the various
groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the

senior ODACID official In Mexico, LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile |
factions both involveu in planning this attempt and those opposed to it. Coverage
of targets in this area algo enables the Station to keep abreast of the plans and
activities ofthe various groups which make up the Spanish Republican exile
community in Mexico City.

LIFEAT/CI-CE Coverage: LIFEAT leads in this area are exploited in the-re-
porting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Lron =
Curtain countries, and the travel of U.S. citizens, especially Communists and
Leftists, co Cuba, Through coverage of the American Communist Group in
Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amount of
information on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who
reside in the U.S, One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data

on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted “Hollywood Ten" to regain their
former status in the U.S, film industry,

Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has beenenhanced
through LIFEAT periodic coverage cf former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK-1
and LIVESTOCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or
personnel. Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially
valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations,

Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Station
operations, the Cl/CE information and leads, and the ability of the unilateral
LIFEAT operation to cover seusitive targets without revealing Station interest

‘it has oted in the past, that even with the Station’ 3
i¢ parallel; bur liaigon, LIENVOY operation, a change in.
ent local government administration or a change-in govern-

could end KUBARK participation in that liaison project.

_tmuat be ‘available C) once ‘again ‘undertake’ coverage of the official Soviet and
Czech official targets in Mexico City. Therefore, LIFEAT'S present orientation,
though toward supporting Station Operations and CI/CE mission rather than toward
targets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily available for”
recall into the Sovlet-Czech coverage; ° It is the Station's firm opinion that the
LIFEAT pr oject provides a substantial and vital contribution in fulfilling the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

‘I. Thére ts attached a list of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material
during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the Project’ 8
prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations, a

Il. Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are there-
fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time, For this
reason percentage figures as to completion of project objectives cannot be drawn.
However, an indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment
_ Of the objectives can be noted in that 14,000 pages of raw text were produced
- in the period July 1961 through May 1962, LIFEAT has been in daily operation
, during the review period with the average number of lines covered per month
being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered,

Il. Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to re-
main uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of 4 great portion

of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target... such as Sovier
Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need arise
for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so,

Until’ such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employ-
ment of its assets, especially ia the areas in which the Station does not wish to
reveal its interest or operations to the-liaison- forces involved in the LIENVOY

operation,

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing
LIFEAT assets in “hot mike operations which require access to telephone

Mop es as a target, ‘Seven reels of "hdt mike" take Were obtatied In test-runs on
checking both the operation (including installation of the "miked" instrument

aasigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover. Unfortunately, before con-
tinuous operation could’get underway, the LIERODE installatton decided upon
complete renovation of its telephone system, including the installation ofa
switchboard, This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation against
this particular target, unless a direct line ig installed there, However, it is
_ the intention of the Station to attempt coverage of other targets of interest, In
these plans LIFEAT plays the key role in installation, line and serles cross.

From the brief test runs vla the LIERODE operation noted above, it is believed
that “hot mike" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatly ald
the Station in Its coverage of responsibilities under its present Related Mission
Directive,

WV. Performance of Agents

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex con-
tinued to be good during the period of the project review, wich security being
stressed in all phases of the operation, No security problems were encountered
which were not solved by the personnel involved, Since the success of the
LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Head-
quarters clearances and cvaluation of ncw personnel will continue to be sought
on those new additions who pass a strict field assessment,

Vv. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 September 1961 for FY.
1962 in the amount of $98,973.03. The proposed budget for FY 1963 is broken

down in the attached Ficld Project Outline Renewal Request, Part Il, and totals
$402;-468-09, PIE AFR OO! oy ett co

VI. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those noted in the project outline submitted
herewith and in the individuals contracts and oral agreements (memoranda of
oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the various LIFEAT personnel,

Even .aow with the shift of operational emphasis to Stat fon ‘operations support,
it is thought significant to include a list of HMM's produced through April

The purpose of this project Is to provide, unilaterally, daily informatton on the’ :
activities of official foreign installations In Mexico and the personnel thereof,
as well as coverage of the act ivities of selected individualg and groups in response

” fo Both Station necds and Headquarters requests, Presently, LIFEAT stresses oo oe

3, Background

Project LIFEAT was orlgtnated on 3.October 1950 as a untlateral telephoné'tap
operation, Actual initiation of operations under this authority occurred on 18
January 1951, and the operation has run continuou.ly from that date, The pro-
Ject was opened with the ins:allailon of a single tap and has grown In the past

eleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines in.a glven month,

The LIFEAT Project [sa unilateral operation completely independent from any —
Ilaison arrangement, It ts staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the ma
jority of personnel being Indigenous controlled agents,

During the past eleven years, Project LIFEAT has produced more than 83, 500
(estimate) pages of operational and intelligence information ta direct support of
Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and contributed matertlally to the tn-
telligence gathering activities connected with the Sovlet-Satellite Bloc and more
recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico. In addition, LIFEAT has
been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the American Communist
Group in Mexico (ACGM), as well as the activities of the exile groups ‘and local

Communists,

: - With the LIENVOY' 8 assum tion of coverage of. ‘the ‘Soviet and Chechoslovaktan
Officlal Installations ‘in July 160, ‘LIFEAT assets were relcased from continuous
coverage:of.these two.targets, These asséts. were then employed in diréct
support of Station operations--a role ideally suited for a- ‘unilateral operation
such a8 LIFEAT, and extremely important to the security and success of
Station operations, LIFEAT, after spending much of Project Year 1961 - 1962
programing to this new role and redirecting its assets, has now adjusted to
this role and is fully employed in this vital assignment, |

a. Career and Contract Agents

(1) David M. WILSTED (201-0091295), principal “outside” Case Officer. '

(2) Wayne C, DRABAND-(201-255095), outside assistant to David

M. WILSTED, DRABAND was introduced into the LIFEAT opera-

tlon in November 1961 as a replacement for Ralph B, RAFANELLI

who was transferred from Mexico PCS in the fall of 1961. His OA ‘
was amended 14 November 1961 to cover his use in the LIFEAT

Project, Although DRABAND possessed only limited knowledge of

clandestine activity when first employed, under WILSTED's tnstruc-

tion and Case Officer guidance, plus his own willingness and capacity

for work, it appears he will prove a valuable addition to the

LIFEAT complex,

June 1962), Plans for use of this couple as baschousekeepers
were cancelled when LIFEUD- 22 and LIFEUD-23, who are more
desirable choices, became avallable for LIFEAT use, Ter-
mination has been discussed fully with these indigenous agents,
‘and cerminatlon arrangements were accomplished on a friendly
and mutually agreeable basis (ag In all LIFEAT terminations,
separation is made on the basis of Mexican custom and/or law),

10. Operational Clearances
See Section 9 above,

1l, Cover

There are no changes tn the cover of personnel who have been previously em- |
ployed in the LIFEAT operation, With the new agents employed since the last
project renewal, cover is as follows: «.

14-0000

sha Een + : . . om

a. Wayne C, DRABAND has natural cover of a retired U.S. clvil
servant presently in Mextco with his wife, an employee of
aU,S, government agency,

b, LIEMBRACE-8 has natural cover of a retired U.S. businessman
of many years residence tn Mexico City, z

ce, LIFEUD~22 has natural cover of a Cuban exile employed bya a
Mexican firm in Mexico City, He works regular hours at his
cover employment and partakes In LIFEAT activities before
and after work and during lunch hours,

d, LIFEUD-23, the mother of LIFEUD-22, has natural cover of |
housekeeper for her.son and performs her LIFEAT dutles *

only tn their home,

12, Contact and Communications

Daily contact Is maintained between the Case Officer and the agents employed in
the project, These contacts are made tn a clandeetine manner with varying
patterns established for car pickups, foot contacta, and emergency meetings,
Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and accomplishing the meetings, |
When heavy or bulky material is to be passed, mectings are held at night, En-’
trance to the basehouses by other than the basehousekeepers is made only on the
basis of strict necessity; such as need for equipment repair, installation for
new line coverages, or Ine coverage cut off,

Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents Is kept to a min-
tmum, Pre-arranged open code ts used for phone conversations between Case
Officers and agents, Alternate and emergency communications have been arranged
and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them,

These systems of contact and communication appear suitable for the project
and function adequately from the security and utility standpoints, Locations and
times of meetings are reviewed perlodically and are changed frequently to decrease
the possibility of arousing the suspicions of the residents of areas in which meet-

ings are held,

Control and ‘Mot ivation

Control and motivation are primartly based on two factors: ideology and
financial galn, A secondary factor bs the fear of reprisal from the local
police should discovery occur,

Securlty ; .

During the past project year there were no incidents which were beyond the
capability of the personnel immediately involved to tsolate and remedy im-
mediately, In contrast to previous years, there was no instance of telephone
work crews approaching a basehouse to check or reinove the tap lines running
to that baschouse, Some of the "crosses" made In the telephone centrals
have been removed by the central’s workmen, but these arc of no danger to
the operation unless a full Investigation is made of one of these unusual con-
nections, During the past project years no such investigation has been under-
taken, and no suspicton of the LIFEAT Unemen has been revealed to date,

As for the past few years the telephone company Is continuing Its efforts toward
modernization of the Mexico City telephone system, This effort Includes
changing from overhead lines :o underground cables, cleaning off of the

unused overhead “dead lines" and Installation of new equipment throughout

the city. These innovations will continue to cause security problems for the
LIFEAT complex, but it is belleved that these problems are rot insurmountable,
To meet this challange to LIFEAT security and to prepare for the day when
access to telephone distribution lines (s further reduced by their placement

in underground cables, LEFEAT has recently succeeded In having one of its
linemen (LIFEUD- 2) selected to arrend a four month special course in cable
work, When he completes this course (in July 1962), LIFEUD-2 will have
working access to all cableways and cable termination boards in Mexico City,
This access will be invaluable from both the present security and operational
standpoints as well as for the future when LIFEAT will be forced to tap directly
from the underground telephone cables. As a standard procedure the LIFEAT
personnel continuously work to devise new methods to Increase security, as
well as train in security procedures, so as to continue the high level of security
enjoyed by LIFEAT in the past. .

Training

Initial tratning of new personnel and continuing refresher training for the ex-
perienced personnel are handled primarily by the "outside" case officer, David
M, WILSTED, Minor repalr aud maintenance of equipment as well as emergency
security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with the agents,

* Equipment and Support

As noted in last year's renewal request, LIFEAT cquipment is generally old
and much of {t is now obsolete, With funds provided in last year's renewal,
LIFEAT (within the past month) has begun to acquire some new equipment,
particularly audio recorders, A review of the cquipment situatton in the
LIFEAT sctup has convinced both WILSTED and the responsible Case Officer
that a near-complete-modernization program of the cquipment used tn .
LIFEAT must be undertaken during the coming project year, The local.
KURIOT techniclan hag on a number of ocasslons expressed his amazement —
atthe superior product produced by LIFEAT with the outmoded and anctent
equipment (In terms of use hours) which the LIFEAT complex had to rely on,
Therefore, with the funds requested In Part I of thls renewal request,

- LIFEAT should Be Completely equipped with adcquate gear, particularly audio -

and dial tape fecorders, by the expiration of FY 1953, Admittedly, there ls -
tnvolved large, one-time expenses in Complete replacement of such expensive ©”
items during a single project year, However, It is a necessary move, due 7!
entirely to great wear borne by the equipment, This wear {s now causing such
a rash of breakdowna that the outside princtpal agent must spend a dlspropor-
tlonare amount of his time In maintenance work,

Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almost constant operation since its Inception tn January
1951, and as a vital Sgation operational support asset, {tt ts planned to continue
tt indefinitely, .

18, Estimated Costa: ‘
The following are the estimated costa for Fiscal Year 1962, All figures are
U.S, dollars per year ($US 1.00 equals 12,50 Mexican pesos), Changes In
ceatimated costs for particular ttema will be noted, These reflect not only the
continued Inflationary trend in the Mexican economy, but also the shift tn op-
erational emphasis from prime coverage of Sovter/Satellice activilles lo sup-
port of Station operaiions, In this latter case particular line coverage ts of
shorter duration, causing greater expense in Installation and removal of tap
lines and crosses, In the agent salary category total expease in contract
agent salaries has been reduced somewhat, due primarlly to dropping certaln
contract agents, while expenses for field agent category has risen, due to
the granting during past project year of long overdue sulary raises to all but

three LIFEAT field agents,

problems are considered likely to occur since FAWOHL's rarents

of the termination, it was realized that he would continue to enter .

2. Stafe comments on the Project reriewal request ware:

a) EUTVBE/OPS said that the Statien 1s to be commended on its hand-
ling of the requested Hloo coverage by LIENVOY while maintaining LIFEAT
capability and limiting coverage to those linss most profitable. KUTUBE —
noted tho increased emphasis on explcitation of operational information. a
In order to continues this aspect of the operation, the Station is faced
with the difficult problem of selectivity in targeting and processing
take from these tvo large projects. Every possible effort should be mada
to increase the efficiency of processing to maintain LIFEAT at ite present

hgh level. In KUTUSE/OPS's opinion, LIFEAT personnel and cspability must
be carefully maintained in face ofthe easier but less secure LIENVOY.

b) KUDESK stated that this unilateral asset should be continusd de-
spite the fact that we are running a aimilar operation with the local gov-
ernment. : It 1s hoped that the Station will soon be able to use this asset
dn the investigation ‘of individuals mow to be in clandestine contact
with the RIS, for the purpose of determining whether or not they may be

recruited.

_@) HUTUSE/D notes that the project has been of high value.

developed ‘in “exi¢o whieh has directly affected the entire LIMS:T Projeate
At a menting with the Chief of »tatian on 75 June 1960, LITYIScK asked the

Government Agency,

2) Soviet Diplomatte Activittes:

Project LIFEAT provided coverage of many of the Soviet
Diplomatic activities in Mexico, It was able to show the relation-
ships maintained between the Soviet aad Satellite missions in Mexico,
as well as the increased official contact between the Cuban and Soviet

governments,
MEXI-4304, 21 August 1959, Mecting os Soviet and Cuban Ambassadors

Mexico,

wees gor
August- 1959, Soviet Plans to Bring Pyatniestty”
. “Chorus to Mexico: froin Canada,

ot et bo as
LOO PO gt PEE a he

Through LIFEAT information, the Station has been able to maintain
a current roster of the Soviet Embassy personnel assigned to Mexico,
LIFEAT has been further utilized to give information on Job assignments
within the Soviet Embassy, and to determine in advance departures, arrivals,
aad replacements of Embassy personnel, Large quantities of background -
personality information concerning the official and private livea of members
of the Soviet staff were also provided,

5) Goods and Services:

Throughout the past year, LIFEAT information has been of use to
Project LIMESA, Of particular note have been leads concerning varlous
properties in which the Soviets wece laterested,

6) Miscellaneous Activities of the Soviet Embassy:

LIFEAT material which does not fall into any one category but which
deals with the Soviets and their assoctationand related activittes has been
reported as necessary,

B, Czech Legation*

Information obtained on the Czech Legation during the period under
review was essentially the game as that obtained from the Soviet Embassy,
Although this target was covered only from July 1959 to Jaauary 1960 (due
to the security prablem posed by extensive telephone company cable
renovation work in the vicinity of the basehouse serving the target), valuable
intelligence was gained during the period of actual coverage, Examples

14-00000

” of reports from this source ‘are:

“ HMMA- -13295, :10. July i959, Czech Legation Activities,

(Czech Legation raised to Embaasy status during July 1959)

C. The Polish Legation

The type of LIFEAT information gathered onthe Polish Legation
closely parallels that gathered frorn the Soviet and Czech targets; ~LIFEAT~ ~~
remains the primary source.of information on this target,

D. American Communists in Mexico

Most of the targets in this group have been covered at the request !
of ODENVY, and the production has been partially processed by them, -
Approximately 370 reels were passed to ODENVY for their processing +
during the period June 1959 - April 1960, The most valuable type of
information obtained on these targets deals with travel, contacts, and
aciivities of the American Communist Group in Mcxicuy (ACGM). The
following is a sample of the reports furnished through coverage of this

target group,

~ HMMA-13792, 25 September 1959, Albert and Margaret MALTZ,

a personalities Of.the Cuban Embassy. Of ‘particular interest-has been

the indications provided by LIFEAT of closer relations and increasing
contract ‘betweén'the Cuban, ‘and'Soviet officials in Mexiéo, LIFEAT was
“also able’to provide a firm indication of the Soviet-Cuban announcement
of resumption of diplomatic relations two wecks in advance of the actual
event, Examples of LIFEAT Cuban coverage are:

During the period of the project review, LIFEAT, as in the past,
continued to contribute materially to several matters of LAURICLE

interest,

I, Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Statioa Operations

During the period covered by this project review, LIFEAT.continued
to support the Mexico City Station through its timely production of leads
which were especially useful, and in most cases essential, in assuring
the success of other Station operations. . The following is 2 list,
necessarily selective, of the use made of leads from, and support of
other projects rendered by Project LIFEAT,

+“. SEIFEAT/LIMERICK: 1) Of spectal note is the support pro-
vided to the Station's AELMPULSE operation. Leads and
information rendered by LIFEAT enabled the responsible = «.
Case Officer to prepare adequately for this recruitment attempt
of an officer of the Soviet Embassy. Following the actual
attempt, LIFEAT/LIMERICK was used a3 a security device
to protect the Scation assets employed in the operation. 2) As
noted in LA. (5) above, Project LIMESA was provided with
continuing support by Project LIFEAT, Notable among the
information and leads provided were those concerning Specific
properties which the Soviets were interested in renting and/or
buying, 3) LIFEAT has provided a check on doudle-agent
LITARDY-I, giving verification of his activities and contacts.
A similar check has also been provided on the activities of
informant LIPAGAN-L.

LIFEAT/LIVERY: 1) This phase of LIFEAT closely
supported the projected LITACIT physical penetration operation
aimed at the LIVERY-establishment in Mexico City, LIFEAT
provided essential information on the rostérs of night duty
officers as well as background information on the target.
2 LIFEAT/LIVERY provided support for the installation of
technical surveillance against LITACH, Without the informarion
provided by LIFEAT, this operation would have been extremely
hazardous at best, and probably would have been entirely
impossible,, “ORF ASY

4 .

Una WARREN, believed to have boon a contact of
Polish officials ‘in ‘Mexico, 3) LIFEAT leads also lead to the
surveillance of a clandestine meeting of Alexander BEKIER,
Polish Counselor vf Legation in Mexico, Due to the advance
notice of the meeting given by LIFEAT, MKCHARITY was
given time to plan technical coverage of the mecting and
prepare especially fabricated equipment for this coverage,
4) LIFEAT was also responsible for the discovery of the
location of a Polish’ Intelligence basehouse, This information
was operationally important to the responsible Case Officer,

LIFEAT/LIERODE: In this phase of the LIFEAT project

leads have been most rewarding in terms of agents actually |

recruited and operations supported by LIFEAT provided

o : information, - J) LIERODE produced leads which were

! directly responsible for the recruitment of agents LITANGO-1 ~
and LITAMIL-3, while providing security check and information
which have increased the value of agent LITANGO, 2) The
defections of LITAINT-1 aad LITAG-1 were greatly aided by
LIFEAT leads and information, The internal reaction to
the defections in the target establishment were also readily
available through LIFEAT, 3) At present LIERODE is
providing coverage, both from a security and informational
standpoint, of the attempt to place a recruited agent as
Mexico-based advisor to a high official of the Cuban Intellt-
gence, This operation is largely dependent upon LIFEAT
leads and support for security coverage of the agent's
activities, 4) LIFEAT/LIERODE has been unusually
successful in providing information which has enabled the
Station to identify nearly all the Cuban agents operating in
Mexico, Due to the increasing importance of the Cuban target,
these revelations are of utmost importance,

Coverage of a CI/CE nature was provided by LIFEAT targeted’
against a recruited member of the Mexicaa Commuaist Party,
aad has produced leads on semi-clandestine travel of party
members behind the Iron Curtain, a3 well as providing a check
on the veracity of the agent.

Project LIFEAT has been emploved also in suppast tha ne *
highly sensitive LIEMIL opezation. C :

“ J. \Conclusion * ;
© It is-the Opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided
~ to other Station operations, the CE information obtained, and the positive
intetligence gathered by Project LIFEAT well justify the expenditure of
KUBARK assets in terms of funds, personnel, time aad security risk,
The information produced by this operation has materiaily contributed to
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive, .

K. There is actached herewith a complete list of HMMs produced from
LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1959 through May 1960,
. (See attached sheet.)

Progress of the Operatien

Since the Project LIFEAT objectives are unique in that they are.of
a continuing nature and not designed to be fulfilled within a given period,
no statistics can be cited from which a percentage of coverage on each
objective can be calculated. A generat indication can be given of the
coverage provided by the project when it is noted that approximately
15, 000 pages of raw text were provided in the July 1959 to May 1960 period,
LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the
number of lines covered varying from 12 to 18, Generally, these can be
broken down as follows: :

Soviet Embassy 5 lines
Polish Legation and Polish .
Counselor 3 lines
Czech Legation (Embassy) 2 lines (Coverage suspended

January '60 for reason
’ given in 1, B above)

Americaa Communists 2 lines
Cubaa Embassy 3 lines
Targets of Opportunity 3 tines

Planning for the Future

Following the suggestion and guidance provided by Headquarters when
renewing Project LIFEAT for FY 1980, the Station plans to limit its
coverage to no more than twenty lines at any given time, with the possible
exception of targets of opportunity which could be covered for short periods

1, Area of Operations
This project is cun from the Mexico Clty Station, and is coacernad
with targets located in Mexico City,

2. Purpose

The purpose of this project ts to determine Soviet and Satellite plans,
activities and connections with other Communist elements through the use of
technical surveillance, This purpose is tn consonance with the Related Missioa
Directive for Mexico, dated:20 November 1959, Priority A, Objectiveone; ~ ~~

3. Background

Project LIFEAT was originally appr wed or 3 October 1950 as a
untlateral telephone tap operation. Actual initiation of operations was on
18 Jonuary 195t, aad the project has rua coatinuously from that date, The project
was begua with the installation of one telephone tap, and has been expanded to the
present average coverage of 18 Lincs, .

Project LIFEAT Is a unilateral operation completely. independen: from
aay HMalson arrangement, It is staffed by KUBARK staff and contract emplovees
with a substantial number of local indigenous controlled agents,

During the past nine years, Project LIFEAT has produced more thia
64, 000 pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of the
Mexico City Station's objectives specifically, and has contributed materially to the
intelligence gathering activities connected with the Soviet and Satellite Bloc, in
additton,..Project LIFEAT has been of considerable value and assistance in
monitoring the activities of the American Communist community residing in Mexico
Ctty as well as activities of Cubans and exiles in Mexico,

12. Contact and Communicattons

a. Dally contact is maintained between the Case Officers and the
agents in this project, These contacts are made. in a clandestine manner
with varing patterns established tor car pickups, foot contacts, and
emergency meetings. Pre-arranged ‘signals are employed in setting and .
accomplishing the meetings, When heavy or bulky material is to be passed,
meetiogs are held at night, All movement in and out of the basehouses by
the Case Officers and Principle Agents is done in cars ostensibly owned by
agents, except in the case of LIVERY basehouse where the agents are too ©
old to drive, One of the ind:genous agents is used to coaract “LIVERY base,

made only in great emergencies, :

_.. b.? Telephone contact cone emnirig the project and with the agents -
is kept toa mintmum, Pre-arranged open code is used for phone
conversations between Case Officers and agents,

c. Alternate and emergency signals have been arranged and are
reviewed frequently by the personnel using them, .

d, These systems of contact aad communication appear guitable
for the project and function adequately from a security viewpoint,
Locations and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are
chaaged frequently to decréase the possibility of discovery,

Control and Motivation

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors:
Ideology and financial gain, A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal
from the local police should discovery occur,

Training

Initial tratning of new persomel and refresher tratning for
experlenced agenis is handled primarily by the outside case officer, David
M, WILSTED, Minor repair and maintainance of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed aad continually reviewed
with the agents,

Equipment and Support

It ta believed that much of the technical equipment upon which the
continued successful collection of LIFEAT material depends will require
replacement in the near future, The largest percentage of this equipment
hes been in nearly continuous operation from the initiation of the project
in January 1951 and much of this equipment ts no longer being manufactured,
When present Itmited commercial stecks of replacement parts are
exhausted, new, units will be required for LIFEAT,

Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almosi constant opersticn since its Inception
in January 1951 and it {s planned to continue it indefinitely, oe

made by the Station for pfoject funds, GAB Oi! is sup-orted by the 38SHO00TH
Projest, an EB support project.

2. The following staff coments were nade when the iruject was submitted
for apcrovalt

. a. "ROM has continued its rating of "C" on the disseminated positive
information frun the rroject, noting & slight increase in the disseminations,
and comienting that it provides interesting information to customers on the
nature ang extent of Bloc comercial activities in Moxdica, data useful in
economic analyses, aud reports on exile activities in Hnxico.

b, ®KUTUBE/D recommended renewal of LIFZAT observing that the leads
produced by the operation have been of operational value to LAURICLE
activitivs conducted in Hexico Lity in the rast year. KUTUBE/D comments
algo that the Project has afforded ard can be expected to continue to afford
C$ ngotection from time to time for activitics of particular LAURICLE interest.

c. "KUTUDN/OPS has observed that Froject LIF“AT has been a most useful
operational asset in the Mexico City Station for the nast nine years,
gontinuously providing KUSAR< with a winduw into important targets. KUTUBE/OPS.
requests that the next project renewal noint out what agent recruitments by
the Station kave resulted from or been supsorted by the operational information|
secured by the project. .

ad. "KUDESK commented that it well known that Mexico is being used by
the RIS as a base for third country operations directed against the United
States. Over a veriod of years LIFZAT has supplied valuable leads which
have resulted in the identification of a large number of persons in clandestine
contact with RIS officers; further investigation in several cases produced
information which strongly indicated that the persons involved were
actively assisting the RIS. hile such information ts, of itself, of. interest
and importance, cur respcnsibil:ty in the CI field imposes the obligation to
determine wiat these persons are doing for the RIS and this can oe done only
by recruiting, and-doubling them, it ia therefore Bugpested that LIFEAT leads
and reports of investigations based on them be reviewed for the purpose of
selecting a limited number of the nore promising targets. inereafter, Station
azsets including LIF“AT should be used to obtain the overationa] data
necessary to determine that a tarzet is recruitable, and then a pitch should !
be made. Much tice and effort will be required for such a program, but the
potential rewards fully justify it, and the value of LIFMAT, as a Cl asset,
will be materially increased. .

3. Chief, KUTUBR, in recosmending the Project for renewal to Deputy Director,

-—~ KUBARK,- requested that at-the tina -of-the-next-Project renewal, the Division shoild |
raview the relationshin and coordination of Project LIF:AT operations with those

“who are: sisceotible to defectian-or recruitment in clace are few ‘and far
between and tnat the Station is always alert for such targets and is
conscientious in their develoment. lovwever, the Case Officer ahould kesp
in mind the moré easily accassible and more vulnerable (though secondary)
targeta, i.e. the many contacts, friends, ornloyees, ete. whose develooment
could well lead to the crimary targets. Neadquarters feels it in this
secondary category where more enchasis can-be madé. -The recruitment in”

"arid: Satellite ‘dipton!

bv. The lack of developsent and axploitation of leads from LIFEAT
operations has been reised many tines. In view of the linited reporting
to Headquarters on the exploitation of operaticnal leads, it has been
difficult to state whether the leeds are being fol:oued up, who the
targets are, and whether consiceratioa is bdeirg given to recruitment
aporoaches. Headquarters requests that in each monthly sumary..the
Station supaly aore info under the secticu labeled "Exploitation of
Leads", The statament "leads res:lting fron Ls FAT information are
followed up by other Station assets" is meaningless without soma
explanatisn of the lead follow ups. lieadvarters would like to know
the names and some operational information concerning the persons who

that during the coming year the Station exects to expand its coverage to

be given to limiting coverage to a mmber of lines which can be effectively

exploited.

2 Progress af the Operation

Definite progress has been made in reporting on the objectives of the
LIFEAT Project. However, since LIFEAT objectives are of a continuing nature
and are not designed to be achieved, no statistics can be cited as to the
a porventaga of coverage on each objective. A general indicatim of the
fav tye “coverage can be derived wien it ie realized that some 10,000 pages uf raw

i: statistics cited above were derived. mxcept for a period in July and

American Commmists in Mexico: :

. One of the most extensive and productive coverages maintained through LIFRAT o ‘
" during ‘thie past year was directed against American Commuiists in Mexico. Most of. -
these targets have been covered at the request of ODENVY and the production has
been partially processed by them for the justificstion of one of theird@ots in
their local establishment. A total of 381 reels have beer the result of the.
coverage since 1 July 1957 until 25 April 1958.° .. Le

Foreign Coomunists ‘in Mextco_end Mexican Commmmists:

LIFEAT continued to provide partial coverage of Eduardo. MACHADO Morales,
Venezuelan Commmnist, until the time of his departure for return to Venezuela.
’ LIFEAT also provided some SOreels of coverage on:-Tiego RIVERA, well-known Comauni st.
Mexican painter, until his death in November 1957. From this coverage it was ~
determined that RIVERA was aufficiently concerned over the departure of the former
Soviet Cultural Attache, Yuriy PAPOROV, that he arose from his sick bed in order to
make the trip to Veracruz by cer to insure that ¢ FAPGROV!s departure was without .
