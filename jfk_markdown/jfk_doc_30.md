~ Mise JONES was bora 10 April 1910 at Antwerp, ‘Belgium; she was unmarri:

In late July 1959, Haiti was invaded by a small gr ap of Cubans, suppos
as a prelude to an invasion of the neighboring Dominican Republic. The
incursion was succesefully repelled by the Haitian Government, which
publicly charged RODRIGUEZ with complicity in the raid. RODRIGUEZ the:
closed the Cuban Embassy and returned to Cuba after selling hie private
property in Haiti.

While RODRIGUEZ was atill in Haiti, two attempts were made on his
life. He-accused the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic aad,
indirectly, the Haitian Goverar:ent of complicity in those attacks.

L

Ta November 1959,. RODRIGUEZ went to Guatemala as Cuban Ambassadc:
There, he appears to have associated freely with pro-Commuaist groups. J.
March 1960, he was requested by the Guatemalan Goverament to leave the
country on the ground that he was engaging in activities inimical to the best
interests of Guatemala.

In November 1960, RODRIGUEZ reported to Karachi,. Pakistan, as Cubs.
Ambassador. His wife accompanied him there and served as his chief .
secretary. During the initial months of hie tour there, hie closest relation.
in the diplomatic colony were with officials of the Belgian Embassy,

. presumably as a result of ithe fact. that: Belgium. had represented Cuba when
/there was no. Cuban repres ative in Karachi. During 1961, however, his
‘social contacts were almos exclusively with Sovi atellite and Chinese

In late 1961, ‘when RODRIGUEZ apparently had decided t to defect, he
confided to an acquaintance in the diplomatic colony that he was finished
“with politica and wanted to devote the rest of his life to agriculture. He he:
at the time to go to the Dominican Republic or to another, unspecified Sout!:
American nation. At the time of his departure from Karachi by alr for
Germany ia early 1962, RODRIGUEZ reportedly made only a very limited
statement at the airport regarding his defection. The event apparently
received very little, if any, prese notice in Pakistan.

“the genuineness. of RODRIGUEZ's disaffection with the Castro regime. Fe:
- rensone which have not as yet been fully.reported, the Department of State
