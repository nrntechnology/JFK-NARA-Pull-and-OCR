SET NTE A te coy Be commas

THE ARREST OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND THE OUTLANDISH
GIARGES BROUGHT AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE CP AND MINISTERIAL OFFICIALS
ARISES FROM THE IRREVERSIBLE FAILURES OF THE GOVT IN THE HANDLING
OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS, THE SCARCITY OF BASIC

FOOD PRODUCTS HAS WORSENED. RICE, ROOT CROPS, MILK, MEAT CONTINUE
f
TO BE RATIONED SEVERELY, AND THE AVALLABILITY TO TBE CONSUNER IS :

- NOW BELOW THE 1957-59 LEVEL, DESPITE SEVEN YEARS OF “COMMUNI ST
PLANNING", THERE ARE SERIOUS SHORTAGES OF MEDICINE, TEXTILES AND

HOUSING, “THE LATTER HAS DETERIORATED IN URBAN AREAS TO A LEVEL
FAR BELOW PRE-WAR STANDARDS . SIMILARLY, CASTRO REPORTED THAT THE
SUGAR CROP THIS YEAR WILL FALL PAR BELOW THE SIX MILLION TONS
‘HARVESTED IN 1968. SINCE SUGAR ACCOUNTS FOR SOME 80%.OF TOTAL
FOREIGN TRADE EARNINGS, 1966 INCOME FROM SUGAR SALES, FACED WITH
DEPRESSED WORLD MARKET PRICES, WILL NOT IN ANY WAY MEET THE cosT

‘OF BASIC IMPORTS, ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY,
” CASTRO HAS SOUGHT TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE ECONOMY BY PER-
