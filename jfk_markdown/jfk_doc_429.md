to a meeting, and IDEN F introduced ‘IDEN L-and EDEN E.- TOEN-A know — —

“IDEN T, “but Was aware of TEI-E conly=by reputation, which was. unsavory. ._

IDEN CE claimed cd be a BKHERALD emplovee,-as did DEV I. IDEN A, of
course, knew otherwise, but said nothing. In March 1974, IDEN A got a
call from-IDEN J of the IDEN K, Miami. He was an ex-BKHERALD officer,
and he said IDEN € wished to speak with IDEN A in Miami on an urgent
basis. . :

5. IDEN G’told DEN A that he wanted the latter to work for LNCOLLAR’ | -

to establish iutelligence networks in the Cuban comunity in Key West. He .
said ao one else could do it, and he promised to provide at the start

* US$100/week plus expenses plus money to pay IDEN A's agents. He said

this money would not be reportable as income. When IDEN A asked about
the effect of his own ex-BKEERALD status, IDEN G replied 3KRERALD does
not want or, need to know of this arrangement. IDEN G acknowledged that

. US$100/week: was a small payment, but said any information resulting in a

‘ seizure of. drugs;
‘will be assessed by a board within LNCQLLAR, and money (thousands of

the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings |

dollere) rewarded for this assistance. IDEN A would then be free to split
the money with hia agents. IDEY J, who was at the meeting, added that
within a year IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest lobster

‘boat available.

6.. IDEN G and IDEN J impressed IDEN A with the dangerous nature
of his assignment. They stressed cover as the most important con%ideration,
and IDEN G eaid, "I don't want to go to any mre funerals“, Thay added
that 1f IDEN A got into trouble, thera were 150 LNCOLLAR agents in Miami
who would come to. his aid instantly. IDEN A was gdven energency telephone
numbers and code names, and waz told LNCOLLAR would arrange for his

-airlift out (through the LNTUCK Air Station) 1£ needed. If his LNCOLLAR

affiliation was blown, IDEN G said there would be compensation provided

up to US$40 thousand, as well a: relocation assistance. Tha rélocation
assistance was nok specified, but IDEN A assumed this meant six months
living expenses ani assistance in job search activities, as well as
reimbursement -for noving expenses. IDEN J and IDEN L, another ex-BKHERALD
official, were to come to Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the
local situation. In the meantime, IDEN A was to prepare a report on what
he knew abcut drug traffickers in the Key West area. ‘Two weeka later,

the two did appear in Key West. The little they knew about Key West drug;

activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also contained much
additional data.

7. IDEN A subsequently set up an intelligence net, and began serding
back reports. IDEN A was fzequently sumoned to Miaul for meetings with
IDEN G. Often these meetings were a wasta of tine, and on occasion DEN G

would sot even show up. At one point IDEN J asked TEx A to wrice a
‘paper. on-tha-capability of ex--BKHERALD assets who ware drug traffickers,

~ and who had been trained in infiltration and exf{ltration, to penetrate... |

WODUAL coastal dofenses with drugs. IDEN A- shaved how the asseta could
cireunvert any goverment erfort to atop the drug’traffic. The paper .
“scared .LNCOLLAR to death," according to IDEN A. ‘At the end of June 1974,

"IDEN J asked IDEN A to journey to Washington to brief top LNCOLLAR .

offictata on his conclusions. It was to be an all expense paid trip, and
IDEN A“flev up and s&ayed-one week. Total remuneration received for the
journey was. only US$150. During the week, IDEN A had cany meetings with
IDEN @ and. hia deputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. IDENG .

“indicated at that time he was impressed with DEN ‘A's reports and access

in Key West...

. 8. Leter, IDEN-A gold IDEN G.he had sent lots of reports, but there.
kad been no arrevts, and therefore no bonuses. IDEN A said ha would no
longer work for just US$100/week. IDEN G replied he might be able to .
waka “IDEN A a LNCOLLAR gonsultant to protect his retired status, le also

' promised-IDEN A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in

LNCOLLAR raids), and an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and
agent payoffs. IDEN G aleo spoke of using. IDEN A in LNCOLLAR activities
in Jawaica and South America. Nothing ever was forthcoming on ary of
these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided LNCOLLAR (at its
Yequesc) with the names of potential sources of information in the Miami
ares. “Several persons wére appraached by LNCOLLAR using IDEN A'a name,
and a number of former BKHERALD assets were picked up in this manner.
‘Included in this group are IDEN 0, IDIN -P, and IDEN Q. .

9. In May 1974, IDEN F cama to IDEN A at a party and, while drunk,
said he had heard IDEN G wanted to recruit IDEN A foc LNCOLLAR activities.
In June he made similar comments while at another social gatheting. IDEN A
made’ no corment (other than requesting that IDEN F shut up). When IDEN A
was recruited by IDEN G and iDEN J, they had made quite a point of saying
only they would be aware of IDEN A’s LNCOLLAR ties, Later in June 1974,
IDE} F said he knew IDEN A was working with LNCOLLAR. In July 1974,

TEN G said he did not like having IDEN L, who waa IDEN A's handling
officer in Miami, dealing with him since IDEN L was known to be an
LNCOLLAR officer,’ IDEN G wanted to have IDEN A deal directly with him
in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too
cumbersome. In late July, IDEN G introduced IDEN A to his new coatact,

IDEN I.
10. In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Key West

on which IVEN A’s group was reporting was beconing spooked and overly
cautious. Through séveral of his agents IDEN A learned this resultad

TDEN M's safe. IDEN A subsequeatly has learned IDEN & routinaly sew

sil of IDKN P's raports. -Later, when the revelations in the preceding

IDEN E, and that he had. metitioned this to IDEN G. IDEN G had assered =

‘hin he would be brought tg Washington to discuss the matter, but nothing
ever cama of it. Irontcally, IDEN E was taken tanto LNCOLLAR on the orders
Of LRCOLLAR Director IDEit R, and it was specified that vo clearance or
background check would be undertaken on hin.

1 . .
12. IDEN I ant WEN A decided to approach IDEN ¥ to learn more about

IDEN E, During a one hour discussion, IDEN F' said ha had been appointed

the recruiting officer within BRHERALD for persons who would go to

LNCOLLAR. IDEN F edid he had known IDEN 5 for a long period of tima, and

had brought hin along in BXHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes IDEN F

also enginsared the absence of a security check on IDEN Z by LNCCLLAR -

since he did not want his homosexual relationship with IDEN £ revealed.

At that point IDEN A called IDEN G and filled bim in on what had deen

 Tearnad, including IDEY F's admission that IDEN E had told him IDEN A

18. In addition, he notes LNCOLLAR ig using many retired. BKHERALD

people and forzer 3KHERALD aaseta in its activities. IDEN A believes
these persons, in many instances, are baing both used and abased. Any
flap which occura aa a ragult of LNCOLLAR alsmanagement will bounce
back on BRAERALD, since it appears BKHERALD is tnvolved in the LNCOLLAR |
operation. Indeed, IDEN G has given the impression his activities have
been cleared with and approved by BXHERALD, Those assata who are being

FROM: Chief, Miami Field Office -

suBJECT: IDEN A, ex-BKHERALD Staff Employee .

1. We met with IDEN A, a retired BKHERALD staff employee, on 7 ©
: January 1976 at his home in Tampa, Florida. IDEN A had requested the
- meeting through contact with an attorney in IDEN B. IDEN A spoke for
: : several hcurs about his life since retirement in 1971. What follows is
a long summation of his comments, and at the mero’s conclusion his reasons
no . 2. IDEN A, who had a major role in the’ Bay of Pigs activities, and
who was associated with JMWAVE during the. period 961-68, has waintained
“ . Many contacts within the Cuban community in Flo -LNCOLLAR, which
; was aware of the involvement of some ex-BKHERALD assets (Cubans) in the
drug importation business, had been unable to penetrate this group in
the period to late 1973. IDEN A, in the meantine, had moved to Key West,
Florida, purchased a lobster fishing boat and equipment, and become a
respected member of the community.

'3. In late 1573, a former BKHERALD asset (AMTABY Project) who had
been terminated in 1963, IDEN C, cane to IDEN A in Key West, claimed he
had escaped from jail in Cuba in 1970 (where he had been jailed for drug
Tunning between Cuba and WODUAL), and said he had information on drug
traffic. He asked IDEN.A to contact someone in LNCOLLAR and indicate
IDEN C's willingness to be of assistance. IDEN A replied he was retired
_and could not help. A few months later, TDEN D (AMTABY-27), another
former asset, flew to Key West from Miami. He met IDEN A and informed
him LNCOLLAR had * sent him down to check on IDEN C. IDEN D identified

“ his LNCOLLAR contact ‘as IDEN E, an ex-BKHERALD asset and former BKHERALD
contract employee. At about this time IDEN F, a former BKHERALD staff
employee, moved to Key West and, informed IDEN A that LNCOLLAR was being
staffed with BXHERAID employees in its Intelligence Division, and that
the leader of the division was IDEN G, another BXHER“LD staffer.

4. 4 few months later, IDEN A received a call from IDEN H, another
BKHERALD retiree, who asked about IDEN A's access to boats IDEN H wished
to purchase for a relative of his wife, the relative residing in Venezuela.
He photographed every boat in. the Key West harbor, and it was apparent to
IDEN A he was LNCOLLAR-involved. Later, IDEN F approached IDEN A and said

two BKRERALD people in Miami wanted to meet with IDEN A. IDEN A agreed
to a weeting, aud IDEN F luiredcced IDEN I and IDEN E. IDEN A knew

IDEN 1, but was aware of IDEN E only by reputation, which was unsavory.
IDEN E claimed to be a BKHERALD employee, as did IDEN IT. IDEN A, of .
course, knew otherwise, but said nothing. In March 1974, IDEN A got a
call from IDEN J of the IDEN K, Miami. He was an ex-BKHERALD officer,
and he said IDEN G wished to speak with IDEN A in Miami on an urgent

basis.

5, IDEN G told EDEN A that he wanted the latter to work for LNCOLLAR
to establish intelligence networks in the Cuban community in Key West. He
said no one else could do it, and. he pcomised to provide at the start
US$100/week plus expensés ‘plus. money to pay IDEN A's agents. He said
this money would not be repérteble as income. When IDEN A asked about

. the effect of: his own, ex-BKHERALD status, IDEN G replied BKHERALD does
‘mot want of need to know-of this arrangement. IDEN G acknowledged that

US$109/week was a small payment, but said any information resulting in a

seizure of drugs, the arrest of drug traffickers, or damage to drug rings...
. will be assessed by a board within LNCOLLAR, and money (thousands of

dollars) rewarded for this assistance. IDEN A would then be free to split
the money with his agen IDEN J, who was at the meeting, added that
within a year. IDEN A should be able to afford the best and largest lobster

boat available.

6. IDEN G and IDEN.J impressed IDEN A with the dangerous nature

of his assignment. They stressed cover as the most important consideration,

‘and IDEN G said, "T don't want to go to any more funerals". They added
that if IDEN A got into trouble, there were 150 LNCOLLAR agents in Miami
who would come to his aid instantly. IDEN A was given emergency telephone
numbers and code names, and was told LNCOLLAR would arrange for his

_airlift cut (through the LNTUCK Air Station) if needed. If his LNCOLLAR

affiliation was blown, IDEN G said there would be compensation provided
up te US$40 thousand, as well as -relocatioa assistance. The relocation
assis.ance was’not specified, but IDEN A assumed this meant six months
living expenses and assistence in job search activities, as well as
reimbursenent for moving expenses. IDEN J and IDEN L, another ex-BKHERALD
; were to come to Key West one week later to brief IDEN A on the
focal sitvation. ‘In the ‘meantime, IDEN A was to prepare a report on what
he knew about dreg traffickers in the Key West area. Two weeks later,

the two did appéar “In Key West. ‘The little they knew about Key West drug -
activities was included in IDEN A's report, which also coatained much
additional data. Sk .

“7, DENA subsequently ‘set up an intelligence net, and began sending
back reports... IDEN A was frequently summoned to Miami for meetings with
IDEN G. Ofter.these meetings were a waste of time, and on occasion IDEN G

would not even show up. At one point IDEN J asked IDEN A to'welie.a
paper on the capability of ex-BKHERALD assets who.were drug traffickers,
and who had been trained in infiltration and cxfiltration, to penetrate
tee WODUAL coastal defenses with drugs. IGEN A showed how the assets could
: circumyent any government effort to stop the drug traffic. The paper
oo aa “seared LNCOLLAR to death," according to INEN A. At the end of June 1974,
~ IDEN J asked IDEN A to journey to Washington to brief top LNCOLLAR
. officials on his conclusions. It was to be an all expense paid teip, and
IDEN A flew up and stayed one week. Total remuneration received for the
journey was only US$150. During the week, IDEN A had many meetings with
IDEN G and his ceputy, IDEN M, a former IDEN N staff employee. DEN G
indicated at that time he was impressed with IDEN A's reports and access
weet in Key West.

8. Later, WEN A told IDEN G he had sent lots of reports, but there
had been no arrests, and therefore no bonuses. IDEN A said he would no
longer work for just US$100/week. IDEN G replied he might be able to
make IDEN A a LNCOLLAR. consultant to protect his retired status. He also
promised IDFN A a large lobster boat (taken from those confiscated in_
LNCOLLAR raids), and an additional US$500/month to meet expenses and
agent payoffs, IDEN. S$ also spoke of using IDEN A in LNCOLLAR activities

+ in Jamaica and South America. Nothing ever was forthcoming on any of —
these matters. During this period, IDEN A also provided LNCOLLAR (at its
: request) with the names of potential sources of information in the Miami
ce ee ao area. Several persons were approached by LNCOLLAR using IDEN A's nane,
Do and a number of former BKHERALD assets were picked up in this manner.
Included in this group are IDEN 0, IDEN P, and IDEN Q.

9. In May 1974, IDEN F came to IDEN A at a party and, while drunk,
said he had heard IDEN G wanted to recruit IDEN A for LNCOLLAR activities.
In’ June he made similar comments while at another social gathering. IDEN A
made no comment (other than requesting that IDEN F shut up). When IDEN A
was recruited by IDEN G and IDEN J,- they had made quite a point of saying
only they would be aware of IDEN A's LNCOLLAR ties. Later in June 1974,
“IDEN F said he knew IDEN A was working with LNCOLLAR. In July 1974,

_TDEN G said he did not like having IDEN L, who was IDEN A's handling
officer in Miami, dealing with him since IDEN L was known to be an
LNCOLLAR officer. IDEN G wanted to have IDEN A deal directly with hin
in Washington, but IDEN A objected, saying the arrangement was too

. : an cumbersome. Ina late July, IDEN G introduced IDEN A to his new contact,

10. In November 1974, it became apparent the drug ring in Key West
on which IDEN A's group was reporting was becoming spooked and overly ©
cautious. Through several of his agents IDEN A learned this resulted

fron a direct approach to the violators by LNCOLLAR officer IDEN E, who

. ~ had come to Key West unbeknownst to IDEN A. Through friends in Miami,
IDEN A found out IWEN E was in charge of WEN A's operetion in Key West,
had a homosexual relationship with IDEN F which went back for many years
(and was responsible tor the breakup of IDEN E's first uarrfage), had big
real estate deals going in Mianl, had a Swiss bank account, and was still

using BKHERALD cover in Miami.

11. IDEN P, who was aware of IDEN E's LNCOLLAR connection, and two
other LNCOLLAR assets in. the Miami area, had agreed to assist LNCOLLAR
4 only if LNCOLLAR officials could guarantee IDEN E would never know of
. their relationship or see any of their informant reports. IDEN I arranged
for this through icEN G, and the three agents’ files were placed in .
IDEN M's safe. IDEN A subsequently has learned IDEN E routinely saw
all of IDEN P’s reports. Later, when the revelations in the preceding
. paragraph were known, IDEN I told IDEN A there were many allegations about
IDEN £, and that he had mentioned this to IDEN'G. IDEN G had assured a
him he would be brought to Washington to discuss the uatter, but nothing...
ever came of it. Ironically, IDEN E was taken into LNCOLLAR on the orders
of LNCOLLAR Director IDEN R, and it was specified that no clearance‘or
background check would be undertaken on him. ,

; 12. “IDEN I and IDEN A decided to approdch IDEN F to learn more about
. Dolo, IDEN E; During a one hour discussion, IDEN F said he had been appointed
Pee the recruiting officer within BKHERALD for persons who would go to
“LNCOLLAR.. IDEN F said he had known IDEN E fora long period of time, and :
had brought him along in BKHERALD hierarchy. IDEN A believes IDEN F
also engineered the absence of a security check on IDEN E by LNCOLLAR
since he did not want his homosexual relationship'with IDEN E revealed.
At that point IDEN A called IDEN G and filled him in on what had been
learned, including IDEN F's admiss{on that IDEN E had told him IDEN A
was an LNCOLLAR asset. IDEN G denied knowing IDEN F, but said he would
Sa ‘check on IDEN E, IDEN A met with IDEN G the next day in Miami to fill
him in further, and IDEN G ordered a full investigation. in the meantime,
IDEN F told IDEN E of: his meeting’with IDEN I and IDEN A, and IDEN E
: . . wrote a meaorandum saying a fellow LNCOLLAR officer (IDEN I) -had over-
stepped the bounds. of propriety in his relationship with an LNCOLLAR
-asset (IDEN A), ant that IDEN I and IDEN A were running an investigation
on IDEN E. IDEN E described the situation as "intolerable". The LNCOLLAR
inquiry, then, turned from IDEN E to improper actions by IDEN I in
: discussing an LNCOLLAR employee with an asset. The Internal Affairs
i ’ : - geetion of LNCOLLAR did continue the IDEN E probe and coucluded by May 1975
: that the charges against IDEN E were accuraic. In the meantime, IDEN I
was interrogated by IDEN M on his relationship with IDEN a. °

¥ 13, In August’ 1975, IDEN G informed IDEN § that control of his
operation was being transferred to the Mfami regtonal office, and that
his Financial relalionnhip with LNCOLLAR would be terminated and ther
re-established locally following J September 1975. *On 9 September 1975,
a state-federal task force arrested 39 persons In Key West. IDEN A knew
nothing about the arrents in advance. He called IDEN G to find cut what
was happening, dnd IDEN G said he also was unaware of then. He asked
IDEN A to continue reporting on these developments., The next day IDEN A
met with a source who told him someone had blown IDEN A's LXCOLLAR
affiliacion to the drug ring. He described the leak 3s coming from an
ex-BKHERALD officer who hated IDEN Aw IDEN-A's source, who was in touch
with drug ring membera, told IDEN A the codename of his LNCOLLAR operation
(IDEN S), ‘and IDEN A learned IDEN F had spread this word sll over town.
IDEN A subsequently received telephone death threats (one of che ring
member's girl friend called to tell him a white LNCOLLAR informant (IDEN A)
would not get out.of town alive). There had been eight informant deaths
in Monroe County (Key West) in 1975, all unsolved murders. There was
every reason, then, to take the threats seriously. IDEN A informed
LNCOLLAR about the threats. LNCOLLAR replied that IDEN A was pushing the
panic button, and auked for more information. IDEN A requested that the
emergency evacuation apparatus be used, but LNCOLLAR refused. Finally,
LNCOLLAR said “We don't know what you expect us to do since you've been
terminated". IDEN A, who had been terminated by LNCOLLAR/Washington,
had not been picked up uubsequently by the Miami Regional Office.

14. IDEN A, deniring to keep a low profile, could not talk to many
of his agents in Key West, but the few he did reach were expecting a
portion of the reward money since the ring that was rolled up was one the
agents had reported on for many months. IDEN A checked with LNCOLLAR
on this, and.was Informed his net's information was not used as the basis
for the arrests. . INEN A Learned that IDEN F had passed the word around
Key West that IDEN A was not an LNCOLLAR staff employee, which made IDEN A
fair game for removal: He also learned plans had been made locally for
his murder. At that point, IDEN A chen made his escape with his wife.
In Miami, he met with IDEN M. IDEN M claimed IDEN E had not caused any
of the problems IDEN A had experienced. Concerning money assurances,
‘IDEN M first denied any promises had been made. Later he Said any that
had been made (by IDEN G) were unauthorized. He reiterated IDEN A's
reporting, although accurate, was not used in the arrests.: LNCOLLAR
agreed to provide JDIN A with US$1800 for all his problezs, and raised _
the sum later to US$) thousand. IDEN A accepted the money; but did aot
indicate he was sattoefied with this sum. :

15. IDEN A snuck back into Key West and packed his hduschold goods
His boat. was given to a’ fish supply house ‘to sell, Since

sold the boat for a sum equal to hin debts.. IDEN A's wife quit her job.
without notice, and he estimates hin actual financial tosses ure

US$25 thousand. LNCOLLAR has indicated the US$3 thourrnd ‘payment is
“ail IDEN A will,get”, and he is determined to get more.

16. IDEN A believes many of hls agents think he did receive a payoff
from LNCOLLAR following the arrests, and that he took al] the money and
ran, leaving them exposed in Key Went. The cars of two of his agents
were burned, and IDEN D, IDEN fT, and others in the Miami area quit working
for LNCOLLAR when they learned of the treatment he had recetved and/or
received death threats themselves. IDEN T. As a result, IDEN A cannot
return to Key West, and his looster business no longer exists.

17. The ‘purpose of IDEN A's contacting the BKHERALD ia first to
let us know what has happened to many of its former employees and assets.

. - IDEN A believes BKHERALD should know of the false promises that were used
eo, to lure some BKHERALD employees to work at LNCOLLAR. As documentation,

foe : he provided IDEN 1's grievance letter to LNCOLLAR which is attached*and wee an
for’ retention. IDEN I has, incidentally, been taken out of the Intelligence i
Division of LNCOLLAR ‘and placed in enforcement work in Miami. IDEN T
is currently. seeking to return to BKIERALD employment, and IDEN A says Le
IDEN I will verify his statements on the treatment of BKHERALD personnel
who transfecred to LNCOLLAR. (iDEN {'s home phone in Miami is IDEN 1.) . -
He and the other ex-BKHERALD employees working at a lower level are fed
up with LXNCOLLAR, and are convinc.:d they will never receive fair treatment
in that organization. ince IDEN A believes the recruitment of BKHERALD
‘officers to switch ro LNCOLLAR will be a continuing thing, he feels we
should know the realities of life {no LNCOLLA®.

*(Forwarded Separately} : : .

“18. ‘In addiction, he notes ENCOLLAR*is“ratng “many retired BKHERALD 4
people and former BKHERALD assets in ite act7vities. IDEN A believes t
“thesé persons, in many instances, are being voth used and abused. Any
flap which occurs as a result of JNCOLLAR admanagement will bounce ‘
back on BKHERALD, since it appears BKHERALD 1g Lnvolved.in the LNCOLLAR 5
operation. Indeed, IVEN G has given the impression his activities have 3 .
been cleared with and approved by RBKHERALD. Those assets who are being
turned off by LNCOLLAR mismanagement are going to be lost to BKHERALD aa
well as to LNCOLLAR. Some ofthese persons could be significant assets

in years to come.

-» 1. 19, A flap way not be so far off. In recent weeks IDEN U, who is
writing a book about the role of the Cubans IDEN V and IDEN W in the
IDEN X affair, called IDEN A and said he has information that IDEN G's

‘wife and IDEN Y's business manager made a trip to Florida recently.
Also IDEN U said he has learned that a former BKHERALD man who 48 a

on 7 January 1976 at hie boas in Tita, Florida. Lynch hed requested
‘tha meting through contact with 0GC. One ites of interest to Lynch

7 fod. 7. Lynch currently is in the process of preparing one

- tha Bay of Piga) for publication. Recently, however, ha

spoke with George Crile, who ie writing a book on Watergate burglara

Eugenia Martines and Bernarl Barker. Crile indicated ha and co-author
‘Tayler Branch plan to follow that book with one on the Agency's Cubaa
operations, and focue on Lynch and. William Robertson, two major figures.
in tha Bay of Pigs invasion. ~ Since Hartinez was deeply involved with

- Lynch as a-ship esptain during the Bsy of Pigs and in subsequent
operations against Cuba, he. will be the primary source for the book.

‘2, Lynch believes the story Nartiney will provide will be somewhat,
inaceurate because bs only saw..davelopments-from the-vantage point ‘of
@ ohip captain. Lyacn (whese cohort Robertson is deceased) believes
only ba ear provide an accurate recounting. Tha Martinez book is
echedeled for printing in the summer of 197%. Lynch would Lika to
beat Crila and Branch to the punch. Indeed, he believes Shey will not
pubdliah their took if tney know he ta going to publish one on tha: sera
Subject. What Lynch wishes is‘an indication of ganeral Agency reaction
to any “aniseript be might write on the period. ‘

3. Lynch wishes to write about the operations of tha AMLILAC |
group (Comiandos Mombiset) during the period 1961-67, when Lyoch }
conducted about 100 infiltration and axfiltration operations in Cuba. i
Any mamacript he dréfts will, of course, ba submitted to tha Agency !
for review. Ha does not wish to get into the writing job, however, i
4f there ig9.a blanket proh{bition on describing Agency operations {
which occusred, in that lod. and place. He notes that Marines, not ;
‘fertered Ly Agency restrictions, will provide Crile and Branch with :
his recollections. Lynch believes he can cover the saterial in a way
Which wtil not hurt anyone or expose anything, He had no intentions
of, gett‘ng into the commando raid recounting business. umtil he heard
froa Crila recently. ” *

. & Stace time ia important on this meter, Lynch shall appreciate
a fairly quick response on this question. He recognizes no final.
decision on his manuscript can be mede until Agency officinls review
tt. At cha same time, howaver, it may not be too difficult te ascertain
the presence or absence: of a blanket restriction on writing abcut this

OPERATIONAL RFORMATION REPORT

This report is believed to contain. information of operational interest and may not be disclose to. personnel outside
the Directorate of Operations without the prior permission of the Domestic Collection Givision.

us citizen, individual with longtime relationship with Bulugto
Cantillo. Source is a retired Apency ataff employee.

1. Zulugio Centillo, a Culwa national who resides at 6791 S.W. 2nd
Street, Miami, Fi Florida, is a former Cuban general. In 1956, when
ha was the Chief of the Cuban Air Force under Cuban dictator Ratista,
Cantillo's uncle came to hin with an ore sample the unele had -
uncovered in an abandoned former Spanish mine in Cuba. The ucle
suspected the ore was uraniam. Cantillo brought the specimen to
the US, where fe was assayed by an unnamed US survey company as
being the richest uranium suxvple.the firm had ever tested. Cantillo -
and the mele, who ware tha only individuals aware of the location’
of the mine, tecognized archaic Cuban lavs did not protect their
find, #0 the general atteapted to get Batista to change the mining
_ statutes. Batista suspocted tha ginaral had come across somthing
simificent, andhhe sent a tean of;men to tha Pinar del Rio area
for six ‘months on a search. The team uncovered nothing. Batista —
also tried to work out a deal wheré he would be a partner ia the .
venture as a pre-condition to changing the mining laws. He was : : oe .
unsuccessful. in convincing Cantillo to permit him to become a ; . .
partner. At that time, the revolution reached full fataneity, * and ee 2 7
Ratiota left the country.

2. Cantillo's uncle is still in caba, ' Despite Cantéllo’s imprisonment
by the Fidel Castro regire for ning years, he has never told anyone.
about.bis uncle's find. Approximately one year ago, Cantillo
approached a retired Agency staff employee and informed hia of the
uncle's find. He did so after all ithesa years because of the : k
developing relations between the US and Cuba. Cantillo feels the : ot
US may te able to make use of information that Castro does not
possess about the riches that exist in his om nation, and that
Castro and the USSR vould capitalize on the find if they were to .
become avare of it. In his viev, the 0S shovla know of this .
potentiaad before it conducts negotiatioas with Castro. The general :
is willing to provide the name of the assay company, so that .
documentation can ba obtained oa the purity of the uranium.

3. The general's US contact norea Gentii10 is not the sort of min who
speaks inaccurately abort thingd sich aa this. He described Cantillo
as a "solid guy", and says the information Cantillo has provided

probably is reliable.
