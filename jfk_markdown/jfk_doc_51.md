1. Frtor to my departure for Ye
foliowing subjects witb CNEA@5:

MERTAULT, I discussed

i} In view of the fact that iIAJLT's expenses on her recent
‘rip te India have been ereater n was anticipated, °1,000
aijitional funds have er are te te shortly deposited tc her bank.
Thig will be done by sterile check. It {s to be accounted for
ander the terms of the original centract.

25 CNPA-5 gugpested that ' wre per reports up with me for
posaible annetation and expangien, /!pon exarination on 14 May,
this avpears unfeasible in view of the fact that there are cra

corre ‘ndicators and RI symbole attached directly ta the reports.

3) CNEA-5 sugested that [ pursue with THEKiAULT the
possibtlite of developing an interest in Krishna Menon, utilizing
a cleared publisher who could request Menon to write a book, This
a preach to be based on Menon's acute susceptability to flattery.

4) CNEA-5 sugcested that THERKLAULT be asked to review the
areas of her inflvence in order to lay the groundwork for an
official invitation to visit this country being extended to the
trfee “4nister in the future. ‘ve suggested Sen. George and
Chestar Bowles as possipie points of departure.

5) THEPTAILT is te be informed that her reporte have been
of i:rensurable assistance te the Ambassador end to the U.S.
Gevecnrent vis-a-vis policy :lenning for India.

6) THERIAULT ig to be asked t> come to Washington for a day
or sc in the very near future for further debriefing. This te

to be arranged at her convenience. Fa
S
7) In view of the fact that THERIAULT has been umitting R
of the Agency's role in sponsoring her trip, I suggested that I s
new make ner witting in terns of the security involved. It 2.
seemed advisable to me since it 1s likely that there will be a)
future contacts with TIVKIAULT, CNEA-5 agreed to this. &/
‘ &
2) THERIA'LT 4g to be advised that she is at liberty to al
digeuss any and all aspects of her trip with anybody with the =)

e ception of the Agency's role in sponsoring it.

°) In view of the vast amount of work that must be done,
T suggested that 7 plan to spend two days - 16 and 17 May ~
'¢ 4t becomes necesvary. ‘<n yrevious trips to discuss
“LUT's mi:sion wit’ her, t found that she frequently
“nd other commitments which made it difficult to cover
adequately the material which 1 hed amassed. If this is the
case on this trip, 7 should prefer not to press her. One
dav's latitude seema the better part cf wisdom. CNLA-5
agreed, ve shall see, however.

ic} tn the event that it becomes necessary to reach me,
“ surgest that wife be asked tc get in touch with me,
(5 okson 7-7018))} and that T be asked eimply to call my
