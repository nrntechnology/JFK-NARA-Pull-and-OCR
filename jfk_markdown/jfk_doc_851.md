' REFERENCE -:3 NONE,

1. AMLILAC/33 obtained the following information from
IDEN A and IDEN B, former members of the AMWORLD Group. The
date of the information is mid-july 1964.

,

a. IDEN A was an instructor in a commando section
headed by IDEN C, in a camp located near IDEN D. He was
given the job of instruction in the AR-15 and AR-10 rifles.
Since no manuals were available he had to use the book,
Small Arms of the World. The men in IDEN C's command are
unhappy because they do not trust the planning judgement of
IDEN C. The second in command, IDEN E, is so hated by the
men that when IDEN C leaves the camp he has to take IDEN E
with him.

b. The Intelligence, Chief of AMWORLD is IDEN F. He
-maintains that the Sat a for men in the INTEL section

is personal loyalty to AMBIDBY/1. At one time a PBPRIMER,
who works with AMBIDDY/1, prgsented IDEN F with a list of

men for duty in the Intel section. IDEN F accepted the

list and the men but after the PBPRIMER left he transferred
the men to other sections. Recently IDEN F arrested a man

in the Group and charged him as a spy for AMBANG/1. The

man was physically beaten and jailed. Later IDEN F admitted
he made a mistake, released the man, gave him several hundred
dollars and told him to forget the incident.

“- '@, . The Navy section is composed of a Chief, IDEN G,
Chief of Operations, IDEN H, and Assistant Chief of Opera-
tions, IDEN I. The morale of the ship's crews is low and
many of them state that they will jump ship at the first
‘port of call. A large powered barge is anchored at the Navy
Base and contains all the arms, and ammunition. There is a
- Staging base in IDEN J. A new base of ships is being set up
in IDEN K along with an airstrip. Teams for operations will
‘be flown to this base from IDEN J, go by ship on the opera-
tion, return to this base, and then fly back to IDEN J.

d. For operational briefings AMWORLD uses the same
photos KUBARK uses (The men who have worked for KUBARK and
AMWORLD are aware of this.). ‘

Central America in a light plane. He has hired IDEN L, a
free lance PBRUMEN photographer , to,film the camps and
activities and to publicize AMWORLD.

planned one operation per month for the next 3 months and
then make an all out push with the guerrilla teams. IDEN M

‘be in existence 3 months from now. .
