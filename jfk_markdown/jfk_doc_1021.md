counterespionage for a brief period against the Japanese and
the Italians and the Russians in '41. Then during most of the
War, against the Germans, and then beginning in early '45 until
the middle of '47 against the Soviet service again.

Mr. Schwarz. And then in 1947, did you join the CIA as
head of the Soviet Intelligence Branch?

Mr. Harvey. That is correct.

Mr. Schwarz. Is that also counterespionage?

Mr. Harvey. Yes, it was.

Mr. Schwarz. And then between 1947 and 1952, you worked
on Soviet counterespionage and certain special operations in
the Department for Plans, is that right?

Mr. Harvey. Well, that is correct. It was a particular

command and staff responsibility on Qonmunteations sntermig ence

and for -.a: period of, I would think probably eight to ten

months, I headed a planning staff, along with that.

Mr. Schwarz. In 1952, did you go to fpamineseE
for the CIA?

Mr. Harvey. I did.

Mr. Schwarz. And were you there until. 1959?
Mr. Harvey. Until the end of 1959.

Mr. Schwarz. I understand, Mr. Harvey, that you had some

rather substantial accomplishments there, such as

of assassination is obviously a two-pronged subject, ours and
theirs. We spent countless hours over the years trying to
determine the parameters of how far the Soviet sarvice was
willing to go. This was partly a question of assessment,;.
this was partly a question, to put it just as bluntly,
of self-protection.

I will try to summarize what I think are fair conclusions.

In the field of political assassination, although I cannot

document this by evidence, I have no question but what the
Soviet service has, does, and will continue to use the tool o
assassination to accomplish political gains inside and outside
of the USSR. In the intelligence field, I think you have to
make «a. distinction, the distinction roughly -- and I'm over-
simplifying this slightly -- but a distinction into perhaps
three classes.

One, their own ethnics or nationals. Sacondly, indigenous
agents Of:third countries.And thirdly, the recognized official

staff officers of other intelligence services.

During the seven years that I spent & a, which was
the longest continuous period that I was exposed in depth to
Soviet Executive Action, we lost a great many Russians, a great

many Germans, a certain number of Czechs, Poles and other

nationalities.

“Mrs. Schwarz. When you say you lost Russians, you mean

Russians who were working with the United States?

Eyes Only basis, and the first part of this was the necessary
documentation for the authority which was later signed off on
by Dick Helms as Deputy Director.

Beginning on my page 4, your middle of page 3.--

Mr. Schwarz. Well, just a moment. Page 1 is a cover story,
not the real story, the objectives--

Mr. Harvey. It is both.

Mr. Schwarz. But it does. not recite as an objective, @ iscsi:
assassination or: assassination: capability.

Mr. Harvey. No, it does not.

Mr. Schwarz. Instead, it cites (Ef

Mr. Harvey. Which, I would like to point out, was a

perfectly legitimate objective and was not in a sense, a cover

story except that if this project had gone so far as to the

actual recruitment of any agent for assassination or the target-
ting of any target or the mounting of any operation, it would
have been under this as a cover. But, those assets that were
spotted by QUWINN, for instance, under ZRRIFLE were also

honestly considered for possible clandestine procurement #

So it's -- maybe I'm not making this clear, it's a cover
in a sense, but it's not a phony cover, in other words.
Mr. Schwarz. Dual purpose.

Mr. Harvey. It was a dual purpose.

Mr. Schwarz. You mentioned QJWINN. Was OJWIN/ an agent
who you did hold in reserve for possible usa in connection © *

with the Executive Action program?

Mr. Harvey. No, QJWIN’ is an agent that I considered for
possible use and used for a limited period through §

for the spotting of individuals with criminal and underworld
SES RENNER,
connections in Europe for possible multi-purpose use, none of
ee

whom were ever advised of the use, none of whom, as far as I
personally know, were. ever used.

Mr. Schwarz. But the multi-purpose use included as one
purpose the possible use in assassination?

bv
Mr. Harvey. Only the sense that had we ever been saddled

with a flat, if you will, command performance on assassination.
I might have considered the people spotted by WIN as possibil-
ities.

But, you see, before anybody that is ever spotted is
approached for any operation and particularly -- and please, I
don't mean to sound pedantic on this, =-dente-mean-—to—-- is
Dagurl BL

actually approached, there #s-~a long period of assessment,
crosschecks, so on and so forth. This particular spotting
mechanism never actually went that far, as far as I know.

I only know of one use made by QUJWIN until we terminated

him some months later, I don't remember the exact date. It was

before I went to Rome. I know it was in connection with an

operation in the Congo that was not an assassination operatio

with assassination.

I have checked pages 1 and 2 and 3 and my page 4.

pages that were written by§

Mr. Harvey. As a guess, I'd say they appear to be in the
same writing as these first three pages.

Mr. Schwarz. Are pages 8 and 9 pages that are written by

Mr. Harvey. Well, just a moment, let me get to those.

would guess, were probably §

W's notes and probably
based, at least to an extent, on discussions he had with me,
and certain, sort of problems and questions and principles that
I tossed out to be considered and cares to be exercised.

Mr. Schwarz. Then pages 8 and 9 are in your handwriting,
is that right?

Mr. Harvey. Pages 8 and 9 are in my handwriting.

Mr. Schwarz... And at the bottom of page 8, does that

indicate that you had a conversation with & gon January

Mr. Harvey. Yas, it does.

Mr. Harvey. Yes, it is.
Mr. Schwarz. And it followed your conversation with Mr.
Bissell that you have recounted?
Mr. Harvey. I think probably that might be -- well, when
I first looked at this, I thought this, well, this has got to
be '62, but I am almost certain now that it is not. If this

is true, this might place the first discussion that I had with

Dick Bissell wend this is. difficult to pinpoint

because there were several such discussions in varying degrees
of detail during the period in the spring, and very early in

Now, these two pieces of paper, well, I say two pieces of

from a yellow pad, probably the duplicate of this that I used
to keep on my desk and just make rough notes of conversations
that I had, telephone and otherwise, with various people.

before the “ 26/158s ,-° , and the material which appears above
it which is tabbed SID G, tab 21.

Mr. Schwarz. That would be Sid Gottlieb?

Mr. Harvey. Sid Gottlieb.

Mr. Schwarz. Doesn't the conversation with Sid Gottlieb
on the 25th of January indicate you had discussion which include
the word bankruptcy and you felt assassination was --

Mr. Harvey. There was a general philosophic discussion of
assassination and assassination techniques. There was also a
discussion on a number of other things that were of particular
and specific interest to the communications intelligence field
and the clandestine service's responsibilities aspects, if you
will, and as best I can recall this conversation, this was a
sort of an exchange of ideas and briefing session, probably
held at the request of Sid Gottlieb in my office shortly after
he either took over a new job in TSD or took over as actual
Chief of TSD, which was the Technical Services Division of the
clandestine services. °

Mr. Schwarz. Now the reference in the middle of that
conversation with Mr. Gottlieb to "Last resort beyond last
resort and a confession of weakness." That's referring to
assassination?

Mr. Harvey. That's obviously referring to assassination.
That's probably what I told Sid Gottlieb my opinion’ .on the

use and propriety of assassination as a technique was.

of operational philosophy which I expressed to Gottlieb, that
the question then came in pure theory as to -- as in such cases
as, now assumptions, the. example of 3 wrong, I am not really
sure. But the closest that I can come is that the assumptions -4
it might be desirable in a purely theoretical discussion and in
my opinion we were wrong. Whether I said that to Gottlieb in

the words that are here, I just don't know.

Mr. Schwarz. Who were the two besides Mr. Trujillo that
Make up the examples of 3?

Mr. Harvey. I prasume ~~ I have no idea, but I presume
that the logical candidates at :that point would have been
Lumumba and Castro. By. logical candidates, I mean not that

we were considering them in this discussion as logical targets

for assassination, but that these.-were sort of the three
people that would come to mind ;if you are going to go into this,
these are three to be considered.

as a general problem.
Mr. Schwarz. Now, the material commencing on handwritten
page 4 and commencing in the middle of page 3 of the Ssnator's

notes, reflects in your judgment the conversation that you had

and it is his notes about that conversation, is

that right ?

Mr. Harvey. That is my best guess.

It may also, however, include his. own: thinking. and: so forth
I doubt if it includes -- it certainly would not include any
specific discussions, I don't think,,with other officers,

because wwas under specific instructions not to

discuss this as such with anybody else, at least without clearin
it with me first.

Mr. Schwarz. And he starts, for example,’ by! talking’ about
“Legal, ethical, morale, operational problems” and so forth,

and that reflects the conversation you had wit

Mr. Harvey. Yes, it does.

Mr. Schwarz. Down toward the end of entry 3b -- and 3 has
the heading "Maximum security" -~ do you see that on page
4?

Mr. Harvey. Yes, I sea it.

Mr. Schwarz. There is a sentence which reads as follows --
two sentences, which I should read into the record, three
sentences.

"Within Kubark" -- now, is that the CIA?
