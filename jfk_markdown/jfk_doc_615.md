Case Officer for’ approximately fifteen months. Based on the knowledge of ~
as an individual gained during this period and upon his actual
” performance, I recommend that he be entered for consideration on the SR
Division GS-14 to GS-15 promotion list at this tima = June 1957, Ths slot
“and job which he now occupies, Chief, Soviet Branch, is, of coursa, adequate

to accormodate gich a promotion,

‘ReUBEBewies operational performance hag been outstanding and
notably” versatile during this period. He has engaged primarily in liaison
- and has been personally effective in ‘terns of rasults achieved almost daily,
in terms of reports, operational ‘data, .and joint ‘enterprise; while, overall,.
he has established enduring. professional relationships from which ths
organization as a whole should benefit ‘for Some time te come, In addition,
g.in large part to unique personal talents, linguistic and otherwise,
mz has handled a munber of unilateral cases most effectively. In g
the office, too, as well as in face-to-face operaticnal situations, z

“has been outstanding. He has a flair for and a facility with the written word

ag evidenced by the amount of general and particular correspondence which ha
has initiated, and he knows the organizational "drill" intimately and from way.

‘ batk, .Thus, I feel that he is qualified for the recommended promotion by

ability and experience in both the internal and extemal aspects.of tha
profession. 2 see :

3. Falktive to the more personal characteristics involved in the tena

“managerial ability, judgments are necessarily more subjective but here, too,

I consider Rate bisa to be qualified in maturity, in judgment, and in
experience, He would most certainly tbe a supervisor who could perfora all

the chores or handle all the situations which ke vould ba calling upon
subordinates to take care of, in itself, the beqinaing of any good supervisory
relationship. In actual fact, ho has. had considerable experience in this
regard already and the principal shortcoming I have noticed ia a tendency to
“carry”. cthers by an extension of his om industry. BissMhiiegs is Ht without
his difficulties in the area of personal relationships, He is a purist at
times and menifestly impatient in certain Iman situations where a shrug of
the shouliers would be the best reply. These characteristics do not always:
make for the best personal relationships but are frequently obviated by.

_ intellect and abeve all are correctable and are being corrected.
