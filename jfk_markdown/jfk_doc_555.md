Seccion Preparacion y Organizacion Combativa (Section for |
the Preparation and Organization of Warfare - SPOC), the

’ . stated that she did not think FERNANDEZ was a Communist es he
“ . has always had Catholic tendencies but that he i2 a correct
‘soldier and puts the military above everything. He is divorced
acd his ex-wife is living in Miami with their two daughters,
Francis, born in 1951, and Alicje, bora in 1955.

~ re) ‘ .
.8. & source who is a high ranking Cuban militaryj/officer who has ~
‘ good contacts among Cuban officials (he has not submitted many
reports, but they appear to have been accurate) reported in —
September 1963 that Major Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ Alvarez, Chief 7
of Training, General Staff of the Cuban Rebel Aray, is anti-
Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the
word. He sticks to his military duties acd scrupuloesly
avoids politics; he keeps himself completely isolated from
all political elements. He ig proud of his present status
and thankful to CASTRO for it; for fear of losing it he
appears uhwilling to undertake any kind of activity against
-the CASTRO regime. CASTRO is undoubtedly knowledgeable of
PERNANDEZ’ attitude and has sufficient confidence in him to.
retain him in his present position. CASTRO also is aware
that he has few officers with the military discippine, --
know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.
