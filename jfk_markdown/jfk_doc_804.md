Action required: retire file, again.

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 5 April 1968 agreement
was reached that the WOFIRM relationship with her would be terminated.
A memorandum of contact (NYM-2689) concerning the meeting is attached
herewith, and indicates the reasons for this termination. No admin-
istrative action is required of either the Base or Headquarters

was formally terminated once before (1966). Her file can be retired,
. again, and this time presumably will be the last time.

2. Termination was very amicable, and LICOOKY/1 nolds no ill-
will for WOFIRM: she just does not wish to have any relationship
with WOFIRM anymore.

3. The writer fully expects to hear from LICOOKY/1 from time
to time by phone (in fact, she called later the same day of the
meeting to wish the writer a pleasant Easter, as she had forgotten‘
to do so during the meeting), but does not plan any further personal
contact.

. 6. I knew something was bothering LICOOXY/1 and made her ~ ‘|
@rag it out into the open. : She stacced by remarking thac WOFIRM
anc its computer apparently checked the welfare of its old agents
every £0 often, ana that this was the nature of cur relationship.

- I explained that this was not the case, that I had found out she

was in Manhattan and suggested to Washington that LICCOXY/1 1
might be of some value to us. This surprised her, and she apolo- ;
gized. She then took off on how when she was in Cubaishe had
dealt with Fidel and Che and Celia, and when sae was invoived

with Guatemala she was dealing with AREVALO. She said that she
didn't want to sound snobbish, but that she was accustomed to
dealing with top politicos and intellectuais; she referr:d to a
statement that I had made previously that perhaps she couid get
Tana de GAMEZ to invite her aiong to one of Tana‘’s lunches with
Cuban Permanent Representative Ricardo ALARCON Quesada. She said
that she didn't want WOFI2M to think that she would seex out and
cultivate lower level people, that she wasn't built that way. i
LICOOKY/1 said thac even though Tana was a friend and that she _
liked ner, Tana was not ner ecuai, ana that wana wasn & ‘on bee b

“pedestal”. That ALARCON was certainiy not in LICOOKY/1's intellectual

category. LICOCOKY/i said that she considered herseli as very flexible,
but not that much. LICOOKY/1i is a “special person” and that”

WOFIRM bureaucracy’ -- with the exceptions of "Bill" (ier Mexico i
case officer, a friend of the writer), C/wH/1 (with whom LICOOKY/1

is particularly taken), and the writer (LICCOXY/1 repeatedly assured

“me that she had < very sincere esteem for me) -- probably didn't

understand or acknowledge this. LiCOCXY/l said her feelings for
certain WOZiRMers were one thing, but ner dislike of WOFIRM itself
was something else. WOFIRM is a massive card index that shows Miguel
Angel ASTURIAS as <n old “Nicaraguan war-horse” -- ASTURIAS of _
eourse is Guatemalan. LICOOKY/1 couidn't stop liking Communists .

7. LICOOKY/1 went on and on in this/similar veins, very :

’ impassioned, but very straightforward and without personal rancor ‘

fer the writer. Summing up, the stated reasons as to why she coes
. hot wish to continue regular collaboration with WOFIRM are as
* £oLlows:

i

A., fear of compromise -~ LICOOX¥/] said-that were her :
relationship with us to become known, it would ruin her

-* standing in and associations with the inteliectual

8. Odviously, the unsaid reasons are the ones that reaily
Prought about this “confxrontacion”, in the writer's opinion. These

1 en7 :

ny are as foiiows:

A. emotional instability -- LICCOXY/1, as has been known for
years by the writer, is not tne most stable of individuals;

B. roney -- LICOOKY/1 xeceives ro money from us anymore
: (since ner termination in Mexico), and the writer si uspects
“i ‘that LICOOKY/1 could have more easily rationalized working
Zor the "Giant indices in Wasaington" were sh- on saiery; -

Cc. sex -- in this case, lack of same (LICCOKY/1 cones always :
to emotion=1 involvement with her male associates, and .
her Case Officers cannot fulfill this need, thus giving +
rise to problems; in the past, LiCOOKY/1 could easiiy .
obtain her physical/esotionai fulfillment in Cuba and ;
e“ico without relying on the Case Officer, but now she is
_ getting clcar and quire shop-worn and cannot compete for
attention <rom men in the environment of a place such a5

D. discipline -- again, in this case, lack of same; LIccoxy/1

“4 9. LICOOKY/1 exhibited some anguish over this whole affair.

1. During a meeting with LICOOKY/1 on 7 March 1968, the agent
passed on the following inforzation which may be of interest to the
appropriate !cadquartars components. L/l apologized for the lack
of details, but the agent was not in a, position to puzap for further
information beyond that which was volunteered.

2. On 7 March Tana de GA'SZ, a naturalised U.S. citizen of
Spanish origin, said that she had been telephoned the night before by
the ean af hew halficteter Sereedas (lest name unknown to L/1), her
nephew Roy. The latter is a college stuient somewhere in Connecticur
(possibly the University of Connecticut), and his hone is somewhere
in Westchester County. Roy said that he was calling his Aunt Tana
because he knew that she had worked for ¢SS during wvII; Tana
rejoined that she had never had anything to iio with OSS, that she
had worked for the Office of war Information (OWI). At any rate,

Roy said that he wentad %o tell his Aunt Tana that he had been
*recruited” by the CIA, and that he was only going to work for the
CIA so as to avade th3 draft. Upon being questicned on this, Roy
waintained that he had been ‘recruited’ by the CiA cn campus.

3. The nephew's statements rather rattled Tana de GANEZ, to
the point where she had to take her heart medicine for palpitations
(she has a heart history). Among other things, Tana was upset by the |-
thought of a family sember being affiliated with the CIA, even though |;
the nephew is disliked by her as an individual.

SUBJECT s Request for Termination of Project LICOOKY

i
The L'COOKY Project was last approved for the period | a
3 Canuary 1965 through 31 Decenter 1965 for $5.140-- £2,530
for FY 1965 and $2,610 for FY 1966. lt 18 requested that!
the LICOOKY Project be terminated effective 1 January 1966,
based on the foliowisg information geared to the outline
in CSI-F NO, 230-60.

Q) Project Name! LICOOEY :

(8) Original Project Objectives: Identify asd report
on plans. activities and aseociates of Cestral 2

. Aner ican Communists resident is or visiting Mexico :

tot ste 4 ea .
(3) Reason for Termination: LICOOKY-1 lost her access

to the hard core group of CA communists partly
because of her close assgocaation with LINLUCK who
Publicly renounced fis preak with the G.atemalan.
: . CP in 1962. The loss c! accerzs was also partly
: due to L-l'’s own apparent indiscretion vis-a-vis
some of her close triends in Yexico City. This
cas be attributed both to her os. growing distaste
for the grubhy and blindly unreasonidg members of
thia group with whom she was asked to consort, and
her reaction in her social srcup which took the
form increasingly of arti-Consunist remarks, and |
to the concomitant ‘or possitly resultant) rumors
of increasing currency. that she was in the pay .
of PRSWING, Attempts were made to take advantage a
of her connections with laterary circles ia .
Mexico, but her fiaatility to budget her tame
sufficiently to satisfy station requirerents led
to the decision to terminate ner. A contributing
cause wae also her inability to regularize her
Status in Mexico so she could accept a paying
position which would give her reason to remain
there, with the resultant strain of the thin
Jegend that her father was providing ker support.

mildly successful.

2. Polfzice, 1 May 1966, carried an article attacking the proposed Con-
ference enc ridiculing some of the Mexican participents (Attachment A). It
contains, auong other things, a partial reprint of the text of an interview i :
or statement by Kicolas S. Leonov, Press Attaché of the Soviet Embess:. in i '
which ke states that Mexico should not be dravn into the cold war propaganda
pattle, and he raintains that Jews in the Soviet Union are not miscreated or i
discriminated against. In addition to the attacks and csurterattaczs in the 4
press, efforts were ede (based on LIFEAT on Enrique S20 Calev, Gerard ;
PIERRE-CHARLES, and LIENVOY) to prevent Carlos Pellicer, a Jerling cf the Mexican ~
left but not a formal PCM member, from teking part; Peliicer is an cificial of |

CORTINUATION OF DISPATCH ~2- HMMA-25207

Claining in effect thet it is a cleer anti-Soviet move backed by ODACID. As of
18 Yey, according to the article, nuzerous signatures had been collected on a
Progressive manifesto" protesting tre Conference, The list includes meny well
known Mexican Communists and pro-Comanists. Attached also (Attachment C) is a :
copy of the "progressive manifesto", wiich was published in 21 Dfa on 13 May 1966, {
end a copy of a menifeszo (Attachment D) published in El Heral3o, 22 April 1966, .
by the Mexican Committee for the DeZense of the Jews in the USSR, in which a :
musber of demands are cade on the Seviet Government with respect to the Jews and
their rights. :

3. La Voz de Mexico,15 May 1966 (Attachment E) carried an article vitterly 4
attacking the Conference, which it charges is being organized end held by groups
nd persons in the service of ODACID. It specifically nemes LICOOKY-1, although
the latter's reme is incorrectly spelled, as one of those responsible for the
Conference and says she is “well connected" with ODYOKE police. Sucesos,

21 May 1966, carried an article (Attechment F) attacking the Conference end ite
organizers ana charging toatl wuere vic sininecs suse Loninl the Conferents,
This article carries a picture of LICOOKY-l.

4k. Sucesos, 4 June 1966, included an inserted sheet (not found in ell copies
of this edition) entitled "An Agent of the FBI and IVTERPOL in the Association of
Mexican Writers," which deals almost exclusively with LICOCKY-1, her ezmalsion fron |
Cuba, work in Mexico, and contects end activities in Mexico. It cherges that in .
Mexico she is working for Daniel Jezes, who is responsible to KUBARK (Attachment G).:

5. LICOOKY-1's naze eppeared in a notice (Attachment H) eppearing in EL
Excelsicr, 28 May 1960 by Vicente Echeverrfa del Prado, treasurer of the Mexican
Association of Writers (AEM - Asocieciéna de Escritores de México, A.C.), which
simply stated that LICOOKY-1 is rot authorized to accept duas or handle other
business of the AEM within the province of the treasurer's cuties and odligations.
Hovever, in view of the sdverse putlicity previously, the announcement bad the
effect or implied thet the AEMAC or renbers of that group believed the charges
that LICOOKY-1 hed a part in organizing the Conference and/or is an agest of
KUBARK, The notice, es it appears, also implies that LICOCKY-1 was mishandling
AEMAC funds. Echeverrfe offered to rublish the clarification on the sieet on
which the AEMAC enrourcement appears; nowever, LICOOKY-1 esxed him not to do so ani ;
-said she would take up the notice asd any clarification with the AEMAC Justice end j

Eonor Commssion. .

6. On 9 June 1966 while conversing with SEM (Attachzent I), Leonov said
that LICOOKY-1 hed celled him to say that she had hed nothing to do wits the
Conference, and does not want the Soviets to catalogue her as an enemy. Leonov
commented that LICOOKY-1 had left hin her phone number and had asked him to help
ber (presumably refute the charges that she was involved with the Conference).
The LILINK case officer who currently handles LICOOKY-1 said on the moruing of
4S June 1966 that LICOCKY41] told him she had called the Soviet Press Attaché to
deny that she hed had anything to do with the Conference “because it is whet she
would normally do." Ske did not, hovever, mention beforehand that she intended
to call the Soviet Enbassy. (Tape of conversation is forwanied as Attachment J.)

CONTINUATION-OF DISPATCH oe od | RMMA-29207

t

J. The Station believes that most or all articles ettacking the Conference,
snd particularly those attacking LICOOKY-1, vere Soviet irapired, and it is further
believed that SEMO wrcte most if not all articles attacking the Conference which
appeared in La Voz, Pciftica ard Sucescs. The Soviets, who are probably swere of:
previous Cuken charges trat LICOCKY-] is en ODYOKE agent, probably felt that as :
an Americen closely essociated with the AEMAC LICOOKY-1 vould be vulnerable to
euch en attack. 1

8. As a result of the Sucesos article of 4 June 1966 an official from the
Ministry of Governzent did visit LICOOKY-l to check on Ler documentation. The
officiel said that he did not Lelieve the charges meade in the Sucesos article,
but since her tourist visa had expired he edvised her to immediately leave the
country in order to renew it, end he provided her with a ietter to show to
Mexican border authorities permitting her exit. She is currently in PAPRIVE but
2s sugicts2 te rete tr Mexico in a few days. . :

Al iss : ;
9. As Headquarters is aware, LICOOKY-1 will be terminated effective

30 June 1966; the decision to terminate her was made some time ago, prior to the
occurrence of the Conference end the resulting adverse propeganda., While she
may be of some occasional use should she return to end rezain in Mexico, it is
pelieved that the recent adverse propagenda has impaired ner future useSulness
in Mexico, although reny Mexicans uncoubtedly do not believe the charges and
others offered to "come to her defense."

20, <A dispatch will be prepared and forwarded when the termination has been
completed, end eny rey developments with respect to her alleged peariicipation in

the above Conference will t-) included in that dispatch. ‘

she could regularize ber status here and obtain working papers, we
would bs more than happy to conclude a new arrangement with her. :
She felt there was little chance of this, and we then told her ve
would conclude our arrengement with her sometine in the summer. As !
indicated in paragraph 2 ef the uttachment, the date kas now Deen
established as 30 June, at which time all outstanding financial
arrangersnts with her will be terminated and she will be given her
i

air fare to New York. 4

which side her bread is buttered on, at least here in Mexico. She
- cannot parcel ker time out to her various interests, and therefore.
finds all her time taken up by her unpaid ALMAC cuties. The prefiles
we bave been harping on beve hot materialized except for the one
submitted under iiit4-2d531. fe still hope for ume on Francisco :
VILIAGGAN Kramer and such of tke Uarican literary figures as azount, ‘

LICOOKY Project Progress Report
1 October 1965 - 30 April 1966

1. Production
a. LICOOKY-1 has continued to devote the bulk of her |
time to the Mexican Writers’ Association (AEM). She !
continues to handle most of its administrative work.
She also organizes and does most of the work on the
majority of the projects or activities which the
AEN sponsors.
b. L-1 continued to report on efforts to establish the F
Latin American Writers’ Community (CLE), including
the results of the Organizing Congress in Arica, Chile.

’ She reported on the steps taken by Mario Honteforte .

Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967
Congress in Hexico and on the AEM's probable role in
helping organize that Congress.

c. L-i supplied information on reactions among the Cen-

Heit ae gtets Ah eee de

tral Americaa community in Mexico to the Guatemalan

election campaign and results.

\ : da. She maintained contact with and reported on individuals

of interest to the Station, including Monteforte Toledo,

Any major change in direction by AEH would probably

rather than waiting until she is ready to leave Mexico,
she may then be able to provide S:ation with an ac- i

1. Atteched, at long last, is LICOOKY-1's profile on
Subject. While it is not as penetrating as it might be, it ts
better than we had expected. 1% 18 unfortunate that “Janet”
is not available to query about t>.» saterial allegedly turned
in following L-l's return from Venezuela, since she is so in-
Bawwwus cane Guo GATT Tanctt qrtte © bundle of information.

2. Thie is the first of a series of profiles we hope L-1
can get around to preparing before she leaves Mexico,

3. IL-2} has been instructed to do her best to obtain
Subject's sanuscript on university refors, which is now in the
bands of someone at ,jthe UNAM press, This could bea highly
popular eubject in the train of the current trouble at the UNAN.

1. On 7 February LICOOKY-1 told the writer that Estel
Sakolowska, a long-time acquaintance, had told her that she
is planning a trip to Cuba. Sakolowska is now married to
Mario Madrigal, a Costa Rican medical doctor who is now in
Cuba. Sakolowska told LICOOKY-1 that she is now in the pro- :
cess of obtaining a (U.S.) passport for her child so that
they can travel together to Cuba. This is her child's first
passport. Her explanation for requesting the passport is !
for making a trip to Costa Rica. Sakolowska claims that i
the passport appiacaiivn 15 now in the Etate Rope rtment :
"Security Section".

2. Sakolowska also told LICOOKY-1 that the "Prensa

Latina Bureau Chief" had proposed to her an apparent intel- .
ligence mission to accomplish enroute to Cuba. She believes’ -
this mission is to take piace in Miami. LICOOKY-1 reported Q
that on 7 February Sakolowska had a luncheon engagement co
with "someone" at the United Nations and speculates it may

be to pick up a package to take to someone in Cuba. LICOOKY-1
further speculates that this may only be a gift to someone ;

in Cuba, . . !

3.  LICOOKY stated that she had no additional information.
It should be noted, however, that this item was given ina .:
last minute rush justi prior to her departure from the writer. s
LICOOKY-~1 expects to be in New York until the end of February. ™

4. LICOOKY-1 states that Sakolowska has been a long-time
"left winger". LICOOKY-1 reported earlier on Sakolowska and-
her connections with revolutionaries in Central America and
Havana in dispatch HMMA 27924 dated 21 September 1965 pages
4 and 6. This office is planning no further action on this
matter and in line with the writer's telephone conversation:
with Frank Hughes of the CI Staff today, we understand your
office will be coordinating the Subject with the FBI

REFERENCE : Bemo, Same Subject, Dated 8 February 1956

1. Om 22 February LICOORY-1 told se that the referenced
Pronsa Latina correspondent, according to Sokolowska, had
just advised her she would receive $520 operational expenses
for the alleged intelligence assignment in the Hiami area and
S489 fer treet pesenmable te Cuba. This information was
passed orally te your office 23 February.

2. On 28 February LICOOXY-1 told me that while visiting
with Sokolowaka in Kew York on 23 February tvo FBI agents
called at the Sokolowska apartment and Jntervioved Sokolowska
about ker intended travel to Cuba. According to L-l the
agenta warned Sokelowska that she would be in sexious trouble
if sho attenpted such trip. The interview went on about three

hours during which time L-1 resained in Sokolowska's apartment,

@emetivar tn the iiving room and sonetizes in the kitchen
where the interview reportedly was taking place. L-1 stated
that as a result of the warning by the FBI agents Sotolowska

3. #Preswnably the FBI, if the above etory is accurate, «
had ressoa for this reported action even thouga from the 3
limited information available, from L-1, there would seem a H
possibility of other more profitable corrses of actioa.

4. L-1 states that Sokolcwska had heard that her
husband, now in Cuba, was living in Sokolowska's house aad
with a nurse to vhom he was (engaged). It was partially for
this reason Sokolovska wished to visit Cuba at this time. —

S. This office ia taking no further action on this

Jack,

”

I briefed Gaines for 30 minutes on LICOOKY
giving him the full background on her ‘io,
education, Cl frelationship-~--from recruit-
ment through current use in Mexico. My
suggestion was that she be told to go to
NY and find a job which would give her a
means of lis2lihood as well as cover for any
future CIA income. After 6 months (or some
other specific period cf time) it would be
arranged that either we contact her or she
contact us to determine what her personal
situation was and whether she would then be
in a position to target against selected
persons of interest to CIA in the NY area.
Shs could thea be paid ou a oye) vasin

for herCIA work. Mr. Gaines wanted to
think about it but thought that this would
be the best approach. He will talk to you
before Friday.

flis only question was whether we had any

‘indication whether she was under develop-

ment by the opposition ---Soviet, Cuban, etc.
I told him that as far as I knew there was
no such indication. If I am wrong (per
your and Bill Johnson's recent activity)
you better correct this.

‘ Reference is made to ynmoreesign of ora) St ted States

Gavernment, as represented by the Contracting Officer.

Arrangements have been recently completed allowing certain '
independent contractore of this organization to obtain social security vf
credits by covering such individoals under the social security tax .
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also iaclude .
@ provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the — - -
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since ~
the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4h and 3-5/8% res ectively.

As @ Consequence taereoi, said contraci is ainended by ceieiing
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph:

- “Effective 1 December 1964, social security taxes will be covertly

- deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same é
manner and to the same extent as would be done if you were a Govern- : \
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necessary. its : .
implementation doea not imply ir any manner the actuai creation of an Sooty

' employce-employer relationship. Your legal status under thie agree- . a
, ment continues to be that of an independent contractor. ° :

If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security : _
credits from overt sources you will so notify this organization and an vt
adjustment will be made or covert deductions discontinued, depending

upon the circumstances. Further, if you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this
organization. In such event your covert credits will be erased and your
- Covert deductions returned.

!

All other terms and conditions of said contract remain in full force ne

- and effect. i i

1. LICOOZY-1's efforts as described in reterence have
substantial rerit and some potential pzrticularly if the Stat:cn can
find 8 way to tie them in with the LIRHAM effort in the intellectual
e °

2. LICOOKY-1 certainly is to be coumended for her effort in
grttiag aritcrs beth of the righ ane lef’ evneh aa Carlos PELLICER
Camara to join the AEH. Fron a KUBARK standpoint the nost interesting
contact is the one with PELLICER because he has been the reported force
behind the CONES/CLE effort in Hexico.

3. Although her assigned tasks os reported in para 7 a, b and d

o the LILIKX memo do mot entail making her witting of other Station
assets engaged in KHSPAGN Ops among the intellectuals, on amencment
to her OA is required, and one has been requested. If her efforts

. progress to the poixct where she night be able to influence leftist
writers iu their efforts te establish the CLE in Mexico (para 7 ¢ of
LILINK mewo) Headquarters should be forwarded your ideas on why and how
LICOOKY-1 should be used as up active MHSPAWN agent, and another
armendrent will be required for this role.

4. AMDRIETTE will discuss this operation with the Station during
his TDY.

. 5& Ina view if the restricted OA which confines KUBARK's
association with LICOOKY-1, it is important that Heacquarters remain
aware of any unusual activity in her personal life which might affect
her security or the granting of amendments to her OA for individual -
operations. Therefore, ve would appreciate your kecping us informed
on a more timely basis of any undertakings such as the recruitments , ;
for membership in the AEM described in reference.

and LICOOKY~2 as “enemies” of the party and that he bad been reprimand
ed for seeing LINLUCK when he first arrived in town. He had deen

. forbidden to see either one of them.

6. Effectiveness
LICOORY-1's target studies and suggestions on possible recruitment

approaches has@beer helpful. While her reporting for the S%#4£ past
month has vot produced any Ingormation Reporte, it has kept the
etation aware of the activities in her particular area of access.
If she is successful in performing her tasks es outlined in the
: parggraph under "Production" above, such information will be useful
: : to the station. LICOORY-2"s effectiveness is limited to hia narrow
target, but such travel information that he does provide does
serve a useful purpose. ‘
7. Plane ,
, It is planned to continue the present direction and guidance
’ given to LICOOKY~1 in an effort to increase the quantity ond quality

of her production.

The same attention will be given toa LICOOKY-2.
