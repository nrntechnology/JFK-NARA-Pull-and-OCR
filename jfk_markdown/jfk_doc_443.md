+ aothing more positive he can take the aoproach that he considered
i the U. S. Goverr:nent tacttly approved bis plot since it obviously
* knew sbout it und did not take any action against him.

deere idee ellie

. Yor the recoré, it can be flatly stated that neither by
etatement nor by implication has toe Central Intelligence Agency .
tadicated te anyone that it approved or was supporting the plot. F ,
On the contrary, those wno queries people they knew were con- 4
mected with our Agincy concerning possible participacic: in the 2 :
plot were told that it had no U. 5. Government backing whatsorver. i ,
Sema of the plotters attempted te contact this Agency through {
various intermediaries, and the ixtermediarics were told that the
Agency wished to have nothing to do with the undertaking and that
any inferraation cofcerning violations of U. 5S. laws should be :
- pacsed to law-enforcement agencies, particularly the Burees of

‘ Custeme and ti.e Federal Bureas of investigation. Techzically,

therefore, tac Ageaty has stayed clear of the plotters, and we

. weld ve in a positica to state that we-had no connection with the :
plot aad had given it ao encouragement or backing of any sort. :

As a procticn! matter, however, if prosecution were ’ .
Maslerrer, and perhaps other defendants. would probably 4 .
: , @latea that they hed CLA becking 2nd some might even belivve i to i
te tras. This might well lead one er more defendants to seek i,
_ @ Gubpgoena duces tecum for an Ageaty witness and the Agency . ig

>. @ecumestation on the subject. As roted above, the witness can
‘) tontify to the fact that the Agency bed in no way participated oF 6

encouraged the activity. If it proved imposaibie to quash the
voquizemest for production of cocuments, however, we would be
feced wit o situstion where «« would almost corteinly bawe to
eloim the decuments were privileged ou the grounds ef security.
Aside from the sensitivity of tae reporte and theiz possible
Compromise ef sources, we would have the problem of identification
of our pessennel under Cover and of protecting the sensitive cover

. 3. Be noted that blanket Bureau coverage cf the activ-
ities of Zolando Masferrer was continuing and that he oce2-
sionally talked with Masferrer -by telephone or in person.

He indicated that the Bureau was intinately aware of efforts
on the part of Masferrer and other Cubans both in New York |
and Florida to procure arms in the U.S. and position thes ir
the Domizican Kepublic. Ye reported that an atterpt to nove

currently was underway and that the U.S. Customs Service was
alerted to move in at the appropriate time to confiscate the
material. (Although acknowledging Yasferrer's gangster vack-
: ground, OBrien complemented hia on his intelligence and ef-
, ficiency and indicated that Masferrer was one cf the ablest

it he was in fact interviewed
Pparently was no record of

it. I told him that NEXNIFE was expected in New York City
in late September to visit his daughter and son-in-law and
that we probably would attempt a meeting with him at the time.

He had no objection.

8. Specific items of susiness concluded, we moved into

. the UN, which was the main purpese of Millian’s attendance
Recent cnanges in Miss.or personnel, includ-

ing the assignuent of Ricardo AlarcémQuesada (201-3475S0)

9. O'Brien's eagerness to discuss the Souza matter
eply interested in it and may
is not satisfied with results thus far ob-
ned. At one noint he indicated that his headquarters was

not at all happy with the take from Souza. He reviewed the

history of the contact with

complete candor beginning with

his initial contacts with Souza in the mid/late 195¢'s when

| O'Brien had open access to the Crban “ission in New York

' O'Brien feels thet the Cubans utilize Souza exclusively on

these latter duties and tend to exclude hin from high level
cal, military, or econosic policy.

SECRET

This, according to O'Brien, accounts for Souza's inability
to provide information of real value. O'Brien did indicate,
however, that the usual P.I.. requirements had no punch, He
cited, for example, the requirements after Souza’s return
from Hawaii, which in effect amounted to: What’s new?

10, Despite the long history of the Souza contact, .
O’Brien is not now meeting with Souza in person. Souza feels

_ that O'Brien is too well known in the Cuban community in

New York and even the most elaborate contact arrangements
would not be free of danger. Souza also shys away from talk-
ing on his home phone for fear that it may be tapped. O'Brien
can, however, telephone Souza and lay on alternate telephone
oz even meeting arrangements. We did not establish the fre-
quency of O'Brien's current contacts with Souza nor did wé
establish at what point in the history of the contact the
decision was made to dispense with personal meetings; the.
mature of our meeting with O'Brien did not permit elaborate
and detailed questioning. He did recount, however, an in= —
teresting aspect of the case which followed iron. ‘the fact

_ that a State Department security officer assigned to New fork,

fnu) Swazev, occupied the apartment directly above Souza
ring his tour in New York and becase quite friendly with
Souza. O'Brien apparently used Swazey ‘as an informal go-

* betweet, on the case. (Should we choose to pursue the Souza

lead, an attespt perhaps should be made to locate and debrief
Swazey with O'Brien's conturrence. Note: This could be |
Anthony Clinton Swezey, DOB 9 August 1913, who was Special
Assistant to Secretary General of U.S. Mission to UN 1946 to
1947, In 1963 he was First Secretary, FSO0-2, in Paris.)

11, It is difficult at this point to identify with ac-
curacy the true nature of O'Brieti's tie with Souza. Based
upon O'Brien's comments, it does not appear that Souza should
be classified as an "agent" of the Bureau in the classical ~

. Sense, particularly at this point when there apparently are
. 90 formal arrangements for contact, no resuneration or even

instructions given, and apparently no reports received from .
Souza. It is probable that a critical point im this opera-
tion was reached about three years azo when, according to
O'Brien, Sovza talked about his advancing age (now 65), his
Fetirement equities with the Cuban governzent, and his fi-
nancial needs in general. O'Brien thought that Souza was
looking for guarantees which would provide for kis futute
should he choose to cooperate fully and ultimately be sur-

, faced and forced to forego his retirement and remain in the

U.S. O'Brien apparently presented Souza's case to his supe-
iors but was unable to generate any substantial enthusiasn.
He stated they were not willing to give Scuza 2 stipend, The

Bureau's position, both then and now, apparently is that
Souza has little potential as an asset for internal security
matters and therefore would not justify any substantial fi-
nancial obligation. In very low key, it was made clear to .
O’Brien that the Agency was interested in Souza's Positive . 4
Intelligence potential (his access in Havana should be good, :
- given his long friendship with Roa and his closeness to 7
- Marfa Celia Girona Fernandez (201-327421), cousin of Celia SoH

Sénchez Manduley) and well might find justification for pro- . . .
viding modest. security for Souza's old age. . , .

12, Throughout our conversation it appeared clear that
O’Brien was of the opinion that there may be a role for the
- Agenty in the Souza operation. We asked nim, therefore,

ether or not he felt. Souza may still be interested in feath-
. ering his nest and, if so, if it would be bureaucratically
- possible to get word to Souza that stich a possibility existed.

*Brien felt that Souza. would still.be interested and he

was of the opinion that he could get the point across. to.
Souza via double talk ina telephone conversation. This ap-
proach was accepted and it was agreed that O’Brien would ad-
wise us of the results after the call was made. If prospects
appeared encouraging, it was agreed that we would then get
together again to discuss the next step which might entail
atranging direct contact with Souza. O’Brien noted that.
Souza lives in Jackson Heights and usually drives to work.
Possibly a contact could be arranged somewhere along the route.
The foregoing generally covers the extent of our discussion:
vegarding Souza. When I met with O'Brien again on 16 Sep-
tember just prior to my departure for Washington, I requested
that he not take any action on the Souza case in our behalf
until he heard something further fron re. : .

. 13. During our meeting we reviewed other members of the
Cuban Mission with particular reference to 2GI types. O'Brien
noted that Chafik Homero Saker Zenni (201-335014) undoubted- .
ly is the senior member of the 0G! group but even so he vas
mot thought te be particularly active. ie reported that
Ssker had been in contact with Lee Lockwood (see above) on
several recent occasions but nothing was known of the nature ' ae
of the meetings. He also noted that the Bureau was in con- t
tact with Saker’s Cuban girl friend in New York City whos
they had just traced without surfacing any derogatory infor-
mation. She is cooperating and the dureau is optimistic | ae
about her potential, He did not provide the girl's name but ee
-Indicated that we should hear about her shortly through chzn- . .

’¢gation of Prensa Latina in New York. He did net. provide the

14, Without prompting, O'Brien surfaced the AMBIG-3
double agent case. He noted that he had been involved to a ,
degree and actually was present at the hotel bar in downtown
-New York when the agent nade his meet with the Cuban czse
officer, O'Brien, accompanied by at least one other Bureau
man, reported that AMBIG-3 winked at them while passing close
by them at the bar on one occasion. O'Brien took this to. ..

MEMOPANDUM

_ SUBJECT: The Activities of Rolando MASFERRER Rojas

1. Reference is nade to a memorandum fron this office,
Bubject: Plot to Overthrow Haitian Government, dated July
6, 1966, concerning a visit to a Yarm in the Atlanta, Georgia
area by an informant who witnessed the loading of arzs at
the farm for shipment to temporary cache sites in hones
da Miami and Coral Gables, Florida; the pickup of arus
from these homes; their transfer to enall boasts already
« - ©@ trailers; und the offloading of latter at Miami River
@ocking sites for shipment to Santo Domingo and ultizata __
sites or the Haitian Coast. While the information below aay
got be related to the incident repcrted in reference, the
Sinilarity of the two reports merits attention.

. 2. A friend of Rolando MASYERRER Rojas told a usually
reliable source of this office that on 27 June 1966 .
went to a house in Miami where 200 fireasrns were
etored. He was accompanied by two Anerican newsmen, one of
whom was a photographer. The arms were removed from the.
ises by agents of MASFERRER whose faces were ccvered,.
Anerican photographer took photographs during the
" wemoval of the arms.

3. The sane usually reliable source of paragraph two
reported in conjunction with the sbove that as of early

duly 1966, ection groups such as the Second National Front

o£ the Recarbray, ALPHA-66, Comandos-L, and Los Pinos Nuevos,
possessed only «as)l quantities of arms. The oniy suoctantial
agmount of arms in the sree was in the bands of KASYZRRER.

“> 4. This information is boing dissentnated to the Feseral
