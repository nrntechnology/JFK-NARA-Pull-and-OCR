Cuban Exile Activities

on January 28, 1960, PSI MIGUEL ANDRES DE LEON ROJAS
reported that responsible Cuban exile groups,in Mexico City and
the United States, who have supp ed Dr. LIO 2 PORTUONDO,
are convinced that General JOS ERI DRAZSACABRERA, who
commands a group of Cuban military exiles in the Dominican
Republic, would not be a wise selection as the military leader
of the attempt to overthrow the CASTRO government. ‘The PSI
further scipeea, hat these Cuban exile groups believe that
PEDRO LUISMDIA Z, former Chief of, the Cuban Air. Force,
would be a much better military leader. (' AW ,

The PSI also advised that information received from .
sources within Cuba reflected that FIDEL CASTRO had prepared a
decree ordering the United States to vacate the Guantanamo
Naval Base. According to this information, the decree was
originally prepared in late November, 1959, but had not yet

been signed for issuance. (2) OY + ge fh

The PSI further reported at he had Heard reports in
Miami, Florida, of an invasion a pt which allegedly would
be made by supporters of ROLANDOAMASFERRER,! a Cuban exile who

resides i ami. The PSI, stated that MASFERRER, ROBERTO

APERNANDES DA, NO OTHMAN, and their associates form a

group which is mae regarded in a favorable light by responsible
Cuban exiles or by responsible elements within Cuba. The PSI
stated that from the information available to him in Miami he
doubted very much that MASFERRER would be able to make an
attempt at invading Cuba or, if an attempt were made, that it
would be successful. “(&) J)

Nicaragua

PSI DE LEON also advised on January 28 that he had
eceived information from within Cuba that ERNESTO "CHE"
UEVARA has not abandoned his project to utiTize pro-Communist
éavaguan exiles and~Cuban "volunteers" in an attempt to

invade Nicaragua. This source advised that approximately 400
guerrillas have been trained to make up the invasion force.

The PSI stated he had received no information as to the timing
of such an attempt, but expressed doubt that it would occur in
the immediate future in view of the concern of the Cuban Govern-

ment over a possible early invasion attempt by Cuban exiles. (94(4)

age and is disposed to follow an international policy that
will not only benefit Mexico but its sister Latin American
countries who are bound together not only by historical ties
but by the same economic and social conditions and identical
perspectives. In apparent reference to DAVID ALFARO SIQUEIROS, “444i; :
leading PCM figure, he stated that some people, who are bles:
, to understand national and international politics altho -
they xpound them daily, have been critical of / LOPEZ

' trip. During the course of the President's trip ”
SIQUETROS made a statement to the press wherein he criticized
the President for not accepting a bid to visit Cuba and stated
that President LOPEZ MATEOS was merely laying the ground work
for a subsequent visit by President EISENHOWER. LOMBARDO was
eritical of President LOPEZ MATEOS in certain respects,
particularly in connection with the imprisonment of the
railroad strike agitators and PCM and POCM leaders,
