DOr. MIRG oald thers was no way ta determine the accuracy
of the Migures givon of planes, guns, etc. received. jrum the Soviet bloc
{and Raly and Canada) but even tf tha (iguves wore skaggeratod 100 per
cent, thay would still be impressive,

. Ho addod that Castro to daily becoming stronger militarily
with weapons and with a largo militia of lose to 303,059 being trained
to wee them while the sconomy coutinues to deteriorate, ‘erhape only
half the militia wouid be effective. But tuat is eiseable, Thus, de eaid,
the longer tha delay in positive military action to overthrow Castro, the

“greater will be tho task. “"@ mast act soon, vigorously and effectively,
' to fesure victery. Anothsr cofeat would be disastrous and would make
Cubans, Latin Armerléaas and others believe Castro to be invincibia,
Then would come accommmadations and oven worss, the (raplanting of
Castro-becked’ Peygimea in the heriaphere, And tha UL 5S. would sufiez
worst of all, being discredited for defeat and "gullt of laterforence.
“in tue UN na nation wouid stand beside the U, 3."

6. Proposal that Connell ao to Cuba with’ Commando Group and
Eatabligh a Government on Lubaa oadl . :

Dy, MUG thea declared that he v WSS Coavinced that Castro
would never be cverthzown by all tho propaganda, the sobctage, eomuvands

vaids, guerrilla activities, rupture of diplomatic relations and deteriorating

ecanoniy, and that tt. cas inconceivable to. establish a sovernment-hrexile
fox nothing would c:.me of it; that the only aoluilon for defeating the
Castro regime was ior the Revolutionary Cenacil ta go te Cuba and ostab-
lish @ goveramert on Cuban soll, abk recognition by all friendly countries
aad nillitary assistance af tio prireipal ally, the U, £., ond that the Us.
be ready to intervene tmimediately with ts Forces. “This would ail have
tc take place in a matter ci 43 hours, cthrrwise ie would fail. J recognise
that thie is a bold pian, but boldness ie necossary, Thors will be many
Figko, many may ba billed. As for myseli, Idon't care if Idie, have
faat all my e0reonal possessiunn and ray gen isa privoner, ' hie reitesated
that all oust be well prepared in advance, there must be no vaciliation,
everything must proceed rapidly. Firat, a commando raid in feres to

Group oo ,

: Anter Dr MIRC | reiterated. his view that he should be the
channel for funds and coordinating the activities of groupe outside the ©
Consejo auch as the Students, FORD {Laber), ste., I ocaid that I undere —
stood that geome of those elomenta were unwijling to function andor. the
Cansojy;: and thatin view of that cituation, did he consider that an.
ivity might.be organised with a dolezat from sech of.

theae groupe aad under the ehalrmanship of'a.momber of the ‘Consejo.
This would sorve to ‘Coordinate their activitios, give them a tie-in with
! the Consejo, yet not make them subservient to it. Dr. MIRC replicd
i that this would merely set up ancther Consejo outside of and paraliel to
i _ the existing Consejo. I did not pureue thie further, not having enough
background of those organizations to be abla to discusa the matter

effectively.
