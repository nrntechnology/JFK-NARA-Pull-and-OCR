"DATE OF CONTACT : 2 May 1963 (2000 to 2345 Hours);
a 4 May 1963 (0200 to 1300 Hours).

ct 1, On 1 May 1963 I travelled to Harrishy nnsylvania,
| and attempted to contact Subject at his home at|2 18% Cumberland sereet|@ lo
at-1930 hours, Subject's son answered the door and advised that his
father was out sor the evening and wasn't expected to return till 2200
a. hours, At 2200 hours I returned to Subject's home to be advised that:
' > he bad not yet returned but was expected momentarily, - In view of the
’ Yate hour, I requested ths gon teli bis father that a representative of
othe United States Government had called and wished to speak to him on

- matters psvtaining to the situation in Cuba, [£ indicated I would return a
about 2000 hours on 2 May. --

3. At 2000 hours on 2 May I called at Subject's home and found
him present. Ho was friendly and courteous, requesting that 1 come
into tha home where ! was introduced to his wife and several of his six
Children. He requested to see my KUBARK identification which he gave
only a cursory glance before returning to mv. He then indicated his

. Complete willingness to supply any information known.to him on the Cuban
and nerzonalities, :

‘8. Subject and his wife make an excellent impression. They |
proceeded to put ma at ease, offered coffee, and generally showed them- i
. S¢lves to ba excalisnt extroverted hosts. The subsequent conversation !
‘lasted until approximately 2345 hours and was somewhat ganeralin nature, ab

Basically we rehashed information already provided by Subject during i
his debriefing by U.S. authorities in Miami and already roflected in his i
01 file. Subject was rather difficult to debriof in that his Engilsh is |

of a second, also of interest, which be will proceed to discuss to the
Confusion of the first. This problem was perhaps compounded by the
fact that Subject wag uncertain as to the type of information of interest

- to KUBARK. He grasped quicaly, however, he type of information

which would be of most interest to us and it rapidly became less difficult
to get to the meat of the subject we were discussing. Further contact
and debriefing of him will become progressively less difficult.

4. We are consolidating the informaticn obtained from Subject
from our two meetings with him on 2 and 4 May below for reporting

Convenience.

6. Basically Subject is able to supply specitic information of
interest. on only five personalities. He knows and was acquainted with
many other personalities in the Cuban government, but his relationship
with them is not close enough to enable him to provide information in

- sufficient detail or depth to allow valid assessment as to iheir suscep-

(ibility to a recruitment or other operational approach,

6. Information on five Cuban government officials, well mown

to Bubject is set forth below:

a. Esubio AZCUE, born about 1912, is presently
employed as a consul at the Cuban Embassy in Maxico
City. AZCUE is a long time friend of Subject. They met
during the mid-1950's when both were involved in revolu-

_ tionary aciivities attempting to bring about a democratic

socialist regime in Cuba. AZCUE is married to a Spanish
woman and was involved in the Spanish revolution. He
was a viry close friend of Manolo “ASTRO who was
reportedly murdered by a group of Communist left wing
revelutionsries which included Fidsl CASTRO. About.
1964 AZCUE was living in France and js believed to have
been arrested by French suthorities on charges resulting
from his involvement in smuggling penicillia and other
antibiotics into France. Subject betieves that AZCUE has
about five children. During easly 12961 while in Naxtco
City, AZCUE was contacted by Subject in order to obtain
advice re the advisability of his. defecting from the Castro
regime and requesting political asylum in Mexics, Aga

result of this contact Subject obtained the impresaion that
AZCUE 1s suffesing from a lack of funds, Since AZCUE
is somewhat ci a snob and a fancy dresser, he finds this
gituation unpleasant. AZCUE also habitually hag a mis-
tress hich in turn is a drain co his pockstbook,

{1) According to Subject, AZCUE is an
excellent drattsinan who studied architecture
at the University of Habana, although he never
obtained a degree. Subject assesses him as a
kitxi man, very happy-go-lucky, but impetuous
and one who “blows with the wind", He doosn't
seem to have the powers of concentration or of
Gingle purpose which would ailow him to be suc-
cesaiul Subject feels that AZCUE has appended
himself to the Castro regime since it offera him
& purpose in Life and a feeling of belonging to
something.

(2) Subject described AZCUE as being a
very brave ran. He felt that should AZCUE.be
approached by hUBARK and requested to coop-
. 7 erate, the physical danger inherent to in-place i
ce ee eee agent work would not affect his decision, In
summery there would be a reascaable chance of
persuading AZCUE to cooperate with KUBARK if ;
a sultable monetary and ideological inducement ss
more : “were offered him. Subject feels, on the basis of
. : their 1961 conversations In Mexico City, that
: AZCUE is not too exthussd about the Castro regime.
gnd it ls possible ne has become even less in
favor of it during the ensuing period. °

b. Enrique RODRIGUEZ Loeches: RODRIGUEZ was
born about 1912 and is presently (ban Ambassador to
Morocco, RODRIGUEZ was involved for @ long Ume in
revolutionary attenipis to overthrow the BATISTA and pre-
vious regin-es in Cuba. He was with CASTRO during the ,
1958-59 period in the Sierra Masstre. Subject became
acquainted with and a close friend of RODRIGUEZ when
both were members of the same £0-cailed revolutionary
"Directorio". Subject alleges that iHODRIGUEZ has dis-
Mked CASTRO since their tiret imeeting during the 1988-89
period, Both Subject and his wife alleged to have received
a letter from RODRIGUEZ written in the sierra Maestre

. in which he Nated his dislike af CASTRO and among other
things referred to him waing the Spanian equivalent of the
term "dirty prostitute". Subject advised that unfortunately
this letter has been:destroycd, Sunject is convinced that

‘if be met RODRIGUEZ on the etreet tomorrow the latter —
would have no compunctions about sitting down for along —

' Giscussion on old times 2s well as the political situation. ~

terms "talk defection ov recruitment” with RODRIGUEZ
should thoy have the opportunity to meet,

ce. Orlando BLANCO born about 1922, is married to

- "~ a woman of Puerto Rican birth which makea her an American

eitizen. BLANCO, according to the latest information avail-

"2 | nevewdble.to KUBARK, is stationed with the Cuban Embasay in -

-* Morocco with the rank of counselor. - Subject met BLANC: +
when the latter became aubordinate to him in the revolu-
tionary "Directorio" working towards the overthrow of the ;

““Batlna segime., Despite BLANCO's revolutionary actiyitscs,

_.., Subject assesses him as being relatively passive politically, = ==«_

” Both BLANCO and his wife. ars believed to have applied for
employment with the Cuban foreign service as a means of

- - leaving Cuba. Subject feels it is posaible they will not return .

"to Cuba when their tour in Aloroccs expires, During 1960-61 °°
BLANCO was employod in ibe National Bank of Cuba.

example of BLANCO's lack Of courage, Subject cited the

fact that he aod his Wife atten.pted to avoid Subject's wife

while Subject was an anylee in the Argentine Ensbassy in 7
Habana. Incidentally, BLANCC's wife's name is Isabelle

LAGO de Blanco and fihe is on excellent terms with Subject‘s og
Wid) Subject is *ppareutly convinced that BLANCO would
wekome an opportunity to meet with him Providing be wei

Seoured that the fact of the meeting would not become known
to Bie Cuban superiors,

d@, Faure CHOMON Medtavilla (201-270370): In es-
Senco jock was y a to reiterate the background
taformation oa CHOMON outUned in paragraph § of UFCW
3674, 13 January 1963. In order to place his relationship
with CHOMON tn Derspective, Subject produced a personal
_ letter to him fron, CHOMON which was written in January
.., $060 and referred to Subject in the most familar of terms,
* Bubjecz alleged that CHOMON bas confided in him on many
ctevere Baaltere of persona! and political nature for many yoars. -
: Ae an example, he cited a difficulty in which CHOMON .
=, beeame tavoived during his tenure as Ambassador to the
- ~* UB8R and while Subject waslstationed in MoscoW#,. CHOMON cy .
St that time was having an affair with a Russian translator/
Secretary assigned to him by the Soviets, This person's
. busband became knowledgeable of the relationship between
em bie wife and CHOMON and beat on the door of the Cuban
: Embaszy ons Gay and proceeded to demand that CHOMON
_ beave hie wife alone, Subzequently a formal protest was
. Fecetved through Soviet foreign eervice channels, As a - 4
Aesiult of this jneident, CLOMON asked Subject t{lake a 7)
walk with him i(He didn't trust the Soviets and felt tha _

| . e. Floreal CHOMON Mediavilla was born about 1930
in Camaguey, and, according fo laiest KUBANK informa-
tion, is presently Charge d‘ Affa'res of the Cuban Legation
in Iraq. Prior to this assignment, CHOMON was First
Secretary with the Cuban Er:-bassy in Morocco. Subject
Geacribed CHOMON as a eenuitive, slightly effeminate
individual who ig relatively disinterested in politica. Sube
ject feels that C1iO}.0N obtained the poaition with the
Cuban foreign service by virtue o¢ ihe fact that be ts Faure
CHOMON's brother. Subject feels that F loreal CHOMON
would also weleome an opportunity to talk with him if the
fact of their meeting could be kept {from the Cuban govern-
ment. He speculated that any attonipt to gain CHOMON's
cooperation would depend on the position Faure CHOMON
has assumed toward the Castro regime. Subject feels

that most of Flcreal CASTRO's decisions are based on the
attitude and opinion of his older brother Faure, If through
Jotters from or conversations with his older brother, Floreal
bad obtained the impression that Faure was becoming dis-
extisfied with the Castro regime, he probably likewize
would assume such an attitude and conceivably be receptive .
to a recruitment approach,

. 1. OPERATIONAL PROPOSALS: We are currently retracing
~~ the individuals Weted Tn the preceeding paragraph. Upon completion of
these traces, it is suggested that a dispatch be prepared to Mexico City
_., Station outlining all information on Ksubio AZCUE Including that supplied -
_.» by Bubject. This dispatch would also outline Headquarters' interest in
- perhaps ving Subject in an operational approach io AZCUE. Mexico
City Station would be asked to descrive the extent to which they could .
Support euch an: oneration through surveillance of AZCUE, locating hig
- present Residence and other information Telative to is current activities
and political orientation. (Com:snt:} Wa discussed in principle with __
the Subject whether or not he would ba «willing to travel to Mexico City
‘with a KUBARK case officer for the purpoze of such an approach. Sub-
ject tentatively indicated his willingr.2es to cooperate in such a venture
’ but appeared to nave some reservation rz ibe danger that might accrue
him, He pointed out.that-he. has a wife and glx chikiren to support and
‘s00n expscts to be joined by his father and mother-in-law who are cur-
rently in Miami. We attezpted to reassure Subject that very little danger

‘would be involved since ho would be under surveillance by KUBARK
officers at all times and would serve only as a meens of effecting the
introduction of KUBARK to AZCUE. Although we cannot be ce

rtain,
we foe) that i. properly presented Subject would  Cooperais with KUBARK
in such & venture,

. 8, Tha information reflected above and relating to RODRIGUEZ,
BLANCO, Floreal CHOMON, and Faure CHOMON, will be. made avatil-
abl to SA8/}1 ‘n order to determine whether or not they may be interested
in exploiting these leads. An operation involving the preparation of a
Jotter by Subject for-forwarding to Faure CHOMON would be simple to
prepare but difficult to carry out in that we do not have a current home
address for him. Subject indicated that he celieved Faure CHOMON in
1963 Uved on First street, #105, Apt. 7, In Habana, However, we can- |
pot be sure that this address is current, Subject indicated that perhaps

as-of 1961, is probably tr first wife or another relative of Fau:9 CHOMON,
She is allegedly the culural attache with the Cuban Embassy in Madrid,

15. UFGA 7428, 31 January 1963, contains information obtained
by JMWAVE regarding Subject and indicated him to be emotionally un-
stable, eccentric, and generally reputed to be something of amt. We
are inclined to agree with this information in 80 far ae Subject's eco-
nomical theory +s concerned, During his stay of almost one year as
an asylee in the as zentine Embassy in Habana, Subject spent the coplous
spare time available to him writing an economic treatise. On our meet-
ing with Subject on May 4th, Subject provided us with a handwritten
short summary of this document, According to this Summary, Subject
has been attempting to correlate economic cycles with peaks of sunspot
activity. He backs up his “economic argument" with reference to the
Old Testament and the Aztec Calendar, If Subject has been ex;
this thoory in public we are not surprised that he is considered some.
what of a nut. It should be noted, however, that many otherwise sane

sidered derogatory in terms of his possible operational exploitation by
KUBARK, Although we have spent Jess than ten hours with Subject, our
impreoston is that be is a rational individual in terms of hie attitude
towards and relationships with other individuals and personalities around
Mim, Asa matter of fact, we obtained the impression that Subject pos-
#esees more than his fair share of what is sometimes termed “common
sense", The handwritten gaimmary of Subject's economic theory as per-
taining to cunspots 1s appe.-sed to this memorandum as attachment.
