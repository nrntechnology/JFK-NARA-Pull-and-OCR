TO THE.DETERIORATION

Gn balance, CIA's record has probably been very good. Jn the
nature of clandestine eperations, the triumphs of an ee
_ agency are unknown; all the public hears about (or should hear:
“-, bout) are its errore, But, again in the nature of the case, an
“agency dedicated to clandestine activity can afford damned isw
visible errors. . The important thing to recognise today, ‘a my —
“judgment, is that the CLA, as at present named and constituted; has
- about used up its quota. Bs margin for future error is practically
oe . non-existent. ~ Cne more CIA debacle will shake faith considerab!;::

The argument of thie memorandum ‘e that CIA's ‘trouble can be traced
© the autonomy with which the agency has been permitted. te opera:
and that thie autonomy is dua to three main causes: © (1) an inadequate
doctrine of clandestine operations; . (2) an inadecuste conception of

- eenception of the. reintionshtp between eperations and intelligence.
". The memorandum slso suggests ways in which sema of these Probe

0 THE-DETERTORATION| ==

Iz iz idle to argue that, because the Communists can do such-and-seeh,

_ We are freo to de it 100. Communism is a creed nurtured in con-
epiracy: end the whole point of Communist social and political orga:.i-
sation ie to make conspiracy effective. If “fighting five with fre’ moacs
contracting the frecaoms traditiozally enjoyed by Americans in order

| to give more frcedo- to CIA, no ane seriously wishes to do that. Yet
1 do. not feel that wo have tried rigorously to think through the limits .
which the maintenance of an epen society places on secret activity.
Until this fe done, CIA's rele will not be clearly defined and under- —
stood. The problez which must be faced is: what sort of secret :
activity is caneistent with the preservation of a free secial order ?

- We roust begin, I belsove, by accepting the fact that the United States i
will continue to be a astion in which politicians will ask questions and

-. Make speeches, reportere will dig out stories, newspapers will pub-. _
lish editorials, individuals, driven by promptings of coascience, ‘will

blurt’ out things ‘harmful to the etate, and $0 on. ' We do not wich ¢

_ There follows from tals, I would think, the conclusion that secret
_ gstivities are permissible so long a9 mex do nat corrugt the
’ principles and practices of our society, that they cease to be
a : permissible when their effect ia to corrupt these principise aed
nes practissr. :
Rach form of secre: activity presents ite own problem. Clandestine

- great problem. Hoesver, when conducted with an open checkbook
and a broad mandats. even espionage can begin to push agninst the
limits of secret activity in an open society. I consider later, for
example, the questica of the Controlled American Source (CAS) sid .
whether the overdoing of CAS ts act beginning to harm other se: wing
i of the government, - 7 aon

Covert political operations present a trickier problem. Occasions

_ arise when it is necessary to subsidise newspapers, politicians anc
organisations in other countries. But corruption of the political life
of another nation is not u responsibility to be lightly assumed. 1 -
wonder whether CIA tue net done too much of Siis fer the joy of it.
Paramilitary activities create an even more difficult problem, if .
enly because the problems of concealment are oe mach more difficult.

In generel, I would suggest that any secret operation whose success ie
| depenéent on the suppression of news, on lytng te Cengreesmen and

journaliete and on the decegtion of the electorate should be undertaken

only when the crisis ie so considarable that the gains really seem to
_ Outweigh the dissdvantages. Thies suggeste that the sise of the pro-
"+ posed operation may be of crucial importance. “Small operations can -
_ be done with a. minimum ef accompanying corruption. The greater.
’ the visibility of the eperation, the more ite success depends on |
-* thuerting the impelees and denying the values ef an epen secisty,
"the riskicr if becemee, aod the move uxgent it 19 thet an overs

‘Ia short, wiles confronted with a proposed operation, we must not |

12. Cperations and olicy

Clandestine activitie should be assessed not only in the context
of their relationship wou, Open society but also in the eentext of theiz
relationship to United. States foreign policy. .

"CIA operations have wot bean held effectively subordinate to U.S
fareign policy.

1, Clandestine ictelligence collection is, by charter, free from
State Depertrnent control. This tact exposes American foreign policy
to a multitude of embarragsments when CIA is discovered recruiting
agents or developing sources in a friendly country. The recent
Singasore cago, when CLA, without netice te the Consul General,
tried to subvert & member of the Special Branch of the Singapore
Police providee an instructive example. After complications of
. ludicrous complexity, incloding an attempt to subject the recruit to
a Me-deiactor test, ig turned out thet the recruit kad long since
informed hie superiors of tha CLA approech and was leeding CLA
inte a trap which, when sprung, produced considerable emberrass-
ment to relations batween the US and the Slagapore government.
There have been trovblice of a comparabic sort in Pakistan and in
Japan (wheve a group of Chinese Nationals were smaggied inte Sescho
to work in a CIA-NSA operation), =

CLA has caid that, in such cages, neither the Embasey nor the Dapar:-
ment In Washington is normally informed of this type of eperation.
in short, no one knows how many potential probleme fer US foreign
poliey -- and hew much potential friction with friendly states -- are
being crested at this moment by CIA clandestine intelligence operations.
Surely there is an argument for permitting State to decide whether the
advantage to be gsined by the operation (e.g, the information derivatis
from en agent withis the Special Branch of the Singspore Pelice) out- —
weighe tho risk (e.g., cxsepersting the iccal government and shakin,
ite confidence both in our purposes and in cur sense), Clandestine
” ingalligence operations should plainly de cleared beth with the Depart -
ment of State ani (save for exceptional inetences ead on agreement of
the Secretary of State) with the local U.S. Ambessader,

2. Covert politisel operations technically require State

Department clesrancy. - In practice, however, ClA has often been
‘able to seize the initiscive in ways which reduce State's role almost

to that of 3 rubber ota: am

. This haa been partly : ue consequence of the superior drive and .
_ activism of CIA perz-unei, especially as compared with the diffidecce z
of State Lepartrcent persornel. Yor example, when men come to Ci’
with the assignment ut developing cevert political campeigne or
organizing coups or preparing for paramilitary warfare, these men
patorally fall to work with ingéavity and seal; they probably foal that
they are net earning their pay uniese, say, they organise a6 many
coupe #9 possible. The coucopt of ‘contingency planning’ bas
legitimatized the concrete preparation of operations etd Sy
in @ hypethetical stage; people did not at first notice that veetinetscy
iplanning, ' when carried to the stage of recruitment and training oi
personnel, creates a vested interest which often transforms contin-
gencies into apparent necessities. Thus, if a group is sssembied
and revved up on a contingency basis, then the failure to carry the
” project through (it ls. orgued) will invite the disappointment and
alienation of the greups eo the pressure inereases to fellow through |
en what bad stasted 04 # pure apeculation. Thais wae a central factor,
of course, in the Cuban decision -- the fact that dlebandment of the
Cuban force in Guatenals just seemed to crests toe mazy problems and
embarrasumente. ving entered inte reisiions with persenalitico in
foreign lanée, CIA has semetimes ceomed te feel that we must thors-

It hag meant too the ihe State Department, often spprised of an |
operation only in iz» ater stagee, is under great pressure to

endorse the operatic. ac already mounted because af the alleged

evil consequences a exerciaing avete. I wel] remember Tom
Mann's remark the vay the decision was made to go ahead on Cuba:

"I would never have iavored initiating thie operation; but, since it

has gone as far as it hae, 1 do not think we can risk calling it off.
Moreover, at atime vhen there te incressing premium on activior,
State, whan it queet.icns CLA operations or initiatives, caste itself in

a prissy, sissy, negative role. The advoente of clandestine activities
seems ‘tough' aod realistic: the epponent has te invoke such intangibles

‘ae the reputation of the United States, world public epinion, "What

do we say in the United Nations?", ete., and seems bepelessly
idealietic, legalistic and ‘soft, '

The result of CIA's initiative in covert political ‘operations has beca

to create situations chich have ferced policy an the State Department.
This was not the or:;, al idea behind CIA. As Allen Dulles wrote

in hie 1947 memorandum to the Senate Armed Services Committ .:c,

“Tne Central Intelligence Agency should have nothing to de with polic;. '
Yet, in the years since, CIA has, in effect, ‘made’ policy in many
parts af the world. A number of governments still in power know
that they bave even txen targets of CIA attempts at overthrow ~- not

& State of mind caicuated to stimulate friendly feelings toward tha

- United States.. Indengeia, of course, is a prime example. |

This experience suggests that the present system by which CIA notifies
State ef a projected covert operation is inadequate te protect US
faterests. There must be seme means by which State can be informadc
_ of euch cperations at.an early enough stage te affect the conception
" and preliminary planning of the operation. Otherwise CIA will con-
tinue to confroct State with propesitions having potential impact on
foreign policy but st too late a point to subject that tmpect te reason-

' able control.
. 3. The Controlied American Source (CAS) representa a particula:
aepect of CLA's encroschmect on policy-meking functions. CIA today

hae nearly ac many people under official cover overseas an State -- .
3900 to 3700. About 1560 of thees are under State Department cover

(the other 2200 are >:asurcably under military or other nen-State
official cover). Or: ginally the uee ef State Department cover for

(CLA personnel vac s-pposed to be strictly limited and temporary.

The Lolisa-Correa-. ickson report stated in 1948, “The CIA should
not use State Departricnt cover as a simple answer to all ite problen:z,
but should proeced ti develep its own outside cover and eventually in
this way and throus:: increased efficiency of ite overseas personnel,
find a way to tumpe: ws demands upon the State Dopartmest.” Noz--
theless CIA has oteniily iocreased ite requisitions for efficial cover.

There are several :~asona why CLA has abandoned its original inten:..
ef deveiopzing eyate:.:6 of private cover. 2 ie easier to arrange cers:
thrungh State; if is iess axpensives it is quicker; -it facilitates ins
szcurity <f operations a8 well as cf communications; i insures a
_ pleasanter life for the CIA peapie. But the effect is to further the

CIA anercachmert on the treditional functions of State.

: 4. Pazamilitary warfare, I gather, ie regarded in some quarters |

gaa a purely technical matter, easily detachable from policy and thore-
fore a proper function ef the Department of Defense. Yet there is
almost no CIA function more peculiarly Copendens en the political
context than paramilitary warfare.

There are several reasons for this. Fer ene thing, a paramilitary :
operation is in its nature a large and attributable operation and ther=i.;,
as suggested above, clashes with the presuppositions of our open
society, (These considerations anced not apply, however, to the
training of, say, the South Vietnamese in guerrilla tactics er to the

. apport of alroady existing guerrilla activities.) For anether, the
moral and political srice of direct paramilitary failure is acute for
us. Communists, when they stimulate paramilitary activity, are
doing what the world expects from them; when we de ft, we appear

- to betray cur own professed principles and therefore cannet afford to

_ compound delinquency by defeat, Moreover, as the reeet Algeriac

’ episode showed, oncs we convince the world that we ere committed to 2
paramilitary endeavor, we will be blamed fov all certs ef things. Acc,
