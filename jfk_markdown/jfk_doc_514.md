child-.during His lycée education in France ani'was frequently disalssed by -
schooldirectors who did not apprectate Lis’ tenperamental performance, Be
also attended several enginecring ‘colleges tut apparently never graduated.
In 1939, he voluriteered for the French Foreisga Legion and was sent to. Tunisia.
-The occupdtion of France in 194] ended his military career. He was demobilized .

: - 2. Subject claimed that he wanted to fight for France,‘ but he did not
wish to join a collective resistance organization, - He decided: to act ‘on his
own so he joined a labor force being recruited in Paris to go to Cermanay.
For awhile he worked in a synthetic gasoline plant in Boclitz near Berlin.
Later he was employed as a-:driver for thé NSEX, During this tine, he began
‘his carcer in black marketing and document forging. Ho claimed that he forged
- Faszes into and out of Germany and did it to help imprisoned Franch officers
- to get back to France. It is felt that the ulterior motives micht still have
been love of excitement and wish to make Roney, He also claimed that he did
. Rot work for the French Resistance, althougs it was possible and probabls
*~ they gave hin orders to fill, He did mention working through intermediaries
and cut-outs, so its possible that ho did actually work with the Resistance but
did not want to tell us. Eventually Subject was arrested by the Cernan regular
police for his activities, and later brought to Berlin where he wis interrogated
for several months at Gestapo lieadquarters. Ea ended up by. spending tine in
Jails‘and concentration camps, He was finally Mberated by the U.S. Arny.

3. After the thrill and axcitement of the. war years was nassed, Subject

-|_ could rot settle dom to a routine existence, So ho Joined up with an

acquaintance who he says convinced him of the necessity to make more money.
They decided to comsit robberies. One was successful. Unfortunately for _
Subject, the other was mot, His friend was apcrehended and confessed, Subject

spent the next five years in various rather x<torious prisons in France.

_ SUBJECT ' + 1, Informal Character Assessment of WIROGUE

. ‘During the Period JulyS9-Nov 1960 ;
2. ‘Suggested Considerations for WIROGUE: Resettlement
. Phase. - -

3.. “Damage Report Contribution

“1... The following observations and. comments ‘are intended to

“-représent an- informal personality assessment and factors in consid-
eration’ of resettlement ‘for AESPIC, now WIROGUE.. It is based on a
period of~training and handling prior to anticipated dispatch--early

Julystthrough late November..1960. These thoughts are based on
personal daily extended contact as trainer/agent handler with Subject
as a member of prospective cross-border team for implementation of
REDSOX Operation. AESENTINEL. One member was re-assessed operationally
unsuitable, which left a team of 2 agents, both of which Undersigned
continued to handle.. It is: hoped that this assessment may be of

some benefit to the AF Desk Officer, who réquested it the day of this
writing. It is intended that. Subject's demonstrated suitability for
AESENTINEL, an infiltration-exfiltration operation into difficult”
terrain in the Soviet Union, will serve as a mechanism rather than

an end in illustrating Subject's general abilities and limitations
for the task at hand. An attempt has been made to present this

material in’ subject categories considered operationally meaningful.

Quoted passages in Part I are Subjects own or the closest approx-

imation memory permits.

. . ae
“2 It is my considered opinion that the SubjectYof this writing

has the highest personal and professional regard for Undersigned. T

- do also consider that, although thoughtful handling and self assured-

ness were prerequisite agent control factors during this case, Subject

* did not causéyan Uncomfortable amount of special handling problems.

The sénior Project Officer was Mr. Perry Crookham, C/DOD/DOB during
the training and holding prior-to-dispatch phase of the operation.

3. Subject Background and Chronological Association Factors
_-. Deemed Operationally Significant —

. A. Subject is.an approximatcly 49 year old eithnic Georgian
fluent in Georgian, French, German and English. Subject emigrated to
France with the remains of his’ family'during the pre-Lycée stage of
his life. His father, a TBILISI University academician and intellect-
ual of some note , elected to stay in Soviet Georgia, during which

period Sovict dominance in the. West Caucasus was fairly well
solidified. Subject considers that his fathersdecision was made of

his own free will lout which nevertheless disappointed Subject greatly,
as he greatly admired him, despite ‘the fact that Subdiect's fathers
decision was responsible for the suicide of his mother, whom Subject
“greatly loved. Undersigned believes that Subject's anguish in
memories, of his parents was genuine. Subject was a clever though.
precocious child during his Lycée education, and freguently was
dismissed by ‘school directors who did not appreciate his temperamental
‘» though erratically ‘brilliant performance. Subject,during this stage’
 ‘dévelopment, probably tried as hard as ever in his life to conform
to the rules Of society, which during that stage of French national
_ -education practices, would probably seem quite strict by American |
. -. middle-school practices. Subject greatly desired academic/professional
° _. "recognition. in.imitation of his father. These feelings were especially
frustrating hecause of hi§ quick mind and. seeming natural ability for
mechanical and electrical theory and principals. I do not: believe he-
7 ever has learned to consider*conventions of living anything more than
: ‘0. a tiresome’ game, to be played when there is no alternative.” Subject's
: quick mind, and: early appreciation, recognition and adaptance of
. Guile did much to ensure the ncessary understanding of French culture.
for moderate success in that country. Subject who is an unusual
looking man even by French: standards, has no. trouble in identifying
with the under-privileged elements of French society, Subject is
“temporally bald, hooked nose, short,’ slender, bandy legged, wiry,
“and of dark complexion but possessed of a dry, caustic wit eager to
“Laugh and contribute in‘ the Caucasian spirit of comarderie to those
whom he considers worthy of friendship. Subject, however, makes real
friends cautiously, and has conciously established for himself
personality assessment. criteria that would do justice to many success-
ful senior FI or CE C/O - agent handlers. :

- B. World War II offered Subject the welcomed opportunity to
show his ability,and ingenuity by engaging in black market affairs in
luxury items andVtravel documents in German-occupied France.” Subject
would wistfully recount stories of his escapades during that period,

which, after really getting to know Subject, seemed to be entirely
mossible. Subject admired the Germans as “worthy @nvonents",
particularly their efficiency and ability to act decisively whether the
problem be tactical or strategic. An extended period of German
encarceration (until war's end) did nothing to alter his opinion.

- Wars’ ond left Subject bored and unfulfilled, The excitement and thrill
of "the game" were gone and Subject's unsettled, numb confusion was
for quite another reason than most of Europes milling thousands of
displaced and ‘shattered families. Therefore, it was not long before
Subject and a close friend from his black market days decided on a
daring daylight bank’ robbery in one of the suburban centers of France.
Subject contends he planned the robbery from start to finish, and
needed only someone to help. Subject and his accomplice carefully. ;
cased a bank, stole a heavy truck and during the height of the business

. day backed the truck fuli speed in reverse through the large street

level plate’ glass window. Subject said he hopped out of the truck with

“ “subject was approached by a-member of

an automatic weapon, while "the people were frozen solid", gathered

up the money and was away quickly. Subject sdid the scheme failed
because his accomplice went to the cache-site to get some of the money
to spend. before it was safe to do so. His accomplice was apprehended
and in time broke down and implicated Subject. Subject said he wes
not bitter at his betrayer,-but rather professed a genuine admiration
for French interrogation techniques. Subject served a difficult
- confinement of 5 years, and was ‘paroled to an-older. brother in
Marseilles, as I recall. .

. _C,.- Subj said that he began at that point. to. appreciate the
) futility of violent, actions, while opposing the authority of society.
He therefore attempted to go into business using some of the inventions '
that he had conceived during his confinement in prison. His winning
| personality and intense drive ,and self-confidence quickly gained him a
“business partter with capital to invest in’ a cinematographic color
reproduction system that was pattened and earned decent profits for the
venture. Subject was still on parole and tied to his older brother "-
“self-righteous, indulgence, however. It was shortly after this that
the AIS who was ‘following up on
cousin in the US who was a

Subject as-an-ops lead furnished by a.
moderately successful lawyer, and who had been long since recruited as
an agent spotter for ecithnic Georgians. Subject was favorably assessed
and removed back from France, because of travel restrictions imposed
under his parole status. I believe that this opportunity rekindled

his old feelings of exhilaration and grateful enthusiasm for the

“ opportunity to perform his deeds of dWing for an authority, sanctioned
by a national state, in this case the AIS, .

: D. Were at last, he considered, was a secure source of backing
and support, for his natural outlets. Subject always considered the
Agency as sn. Geel business partner, ally, and protector. He was
therefore a grateful, sincere "tool" who thoroughly enjoyed his role

atwer,

as lower echelon action agent. Subject wow perbotily feels Vine au equst p>

E. We was a willing pupil, physically active -- since the job
called for physical endurance -- and Looked on self-denial and fatigue
recognition aS a point of honor. -Undersigned was never a poor
athlete, however, was bested on numerous occasions at whatever the
field probéem. Subject absorbed Soviet Realities, Border Troops M.Q.
and basic tradecraft quickly and with great applied flexibility.

F. It was during this period that Subject began to confide
regularly and in depth to Undersignéd. Subject would often tell
Undersigned, "Fred, you must. believe me, I want to do something."

"I will do anything. you tell me to.do, only tell me. "You (meaning
the Agency) want me to kill somebody. - Okay! I do it anyway you say."
I believe Subject was genuinely sincere, and that this was neither an
attempt to impress his C/O or a trust/assurance maneuver.

_  _G, + When. an indefinite hold was placed on AESENTINEL ‘by
higher, Agency authority, one team member was re-oriented and placed
on conservation in a cover job. Undersigned ultimately conducted this
agent back to his Scandinavian home where resettlement. was achieved
‘with a minimum of -arrangements, however, Subject wus transferred to
AF. Division for. projected operational.use in-central Africa. This,
if inemory serves, was accomplished in late 1960. :

6. WIROGUE Resettlement Considerations

; A. AF/S representative has requested comment from Undersigned
on WIROCGUE's apparent reluctance at resettlement attempts in Frankfurt
a/H which are underweigh at the Present time, I believe. It is
undersigned's understanding that iSudbafectind has threated to work for
the French Service if resettlement negotiations do not proceed to
Subject's liking. Speculation has been that this is probably a bargain-
ing tactic to gouge an appreciable amount of additional dollars in his
resettlement claim. Undersigned considérs this a quite valid
assumption, and entirely attributable to Subject. Subject probably
views this threat as particularly critical in view of the seeming
political/economic conflect with the French, and appeeciates by now
one of the differences between the AIS and the [S of a fascist and/or
totalitarian state.

'

--a defiant s

B. However, Undersigned- would Like to suggest the following
interpretation for whetever value may be in it. T suggest that money,
per se, is net the primary end that Subject is striving for. now, just
as it never seemed to be his pri . concern throughout his‘life. I[
believe that. Subject genuinely enjoys clandestine operations, at least,
his conceptien of clandestine operations. Subject probably would, :
prefer to work for the ‘AIS or: possibly the W. German Service because
he has a genuine fondness for the people and many aspects of the
‘Kulture of both countries. The idea of legalized, or at least
“internationally tolerated, "Spying" offers the opp rruni to
. legitimize, and thereby rationalize, Subject's 3

-protecting his.equity in an important, unique, "professional"
category.- , :

that he is

- C.’--Subject,: during the period of Undersignedsexpestre, always’
considered that-.if he had money-fine, if not, then enough would come
_his way from. someplace: to sustain him from one venturé © the next.
“Subject felt that the acquisition of money would be a by-product of
his opportunist. schemes and technical inventions in pursuance of his
main goal-personal recognition for personal achievements-and triumphs.

D. I believe Subject does not expect to be accepted in his
offer of employment with the French.Service, but rather to let our
“minds jump to the next logical step-the full meaning of the result
-of such an attenst on his part. Subject knows very well that he has
violated his parole and would be encarcerated on his return. I believe
“his pride and the probability of censure and ridicule of family and
friends in France would disuade him in the final analysis.
mo E. Subject is a most excellent chess player. [ have never
won from him, nor have I ever seen him lose a game. I consider that
Subject has thought this line of action out thoroughly. It.is
apparent that he is willing to gamble his quit claim settlement on
something that I beiieve he has specifically in mind--possibly the
offer of new documents and identity in some third country. He has
. always had a great desire to "surprise" everyone back hone (i.e. Paris):
with new'documents, a new identity, plastic surgery, etc. I do not
believe that what he wants is necessarily more dollars, but rather
for the AIS to once again help htm (as co-partner) to achieve his aim
.of acclaim, success and recognition, possibly this time to family and
friends in France. : .

F. Udo net believe that. Subiect could ever be vhysically
intimidated, He lest half his front teeth to German interrogators and
the other halt to French prison guards. Additionally, he does possess
pirit that sometimes comes through as sheer obstinacy to

.

friends. -

G. .If it is considerd worthwhile, I believe an attempt should
be made to lecate a C/O locally who has handled him in the past. A
C/O fer wher ect has respect as a higher echelon and whom he
considers uncerstands him. Tf suggest that this C/O interview Subiect

in an uncontrolled environment to determine what it is that Subject

8. Damage Report Contribution

- AL The following constitutes Undetsigned's contribution toa
damage report that may well be needed in view of Subject' s posture in

'..the matter at hand. It covers only that time sequente during which
~ Undersigned actively handled Subject.

B. This span constitutes:

. carly July 59 - late Nov 1960."

c. At that time Undersigned was a junior C/O onthe

. AESENTINEL Project which was’ to be prepzred and launched from the ZI
by SR/DOB, a covert site ops base a formerly in the District of

Columbia.

; -D. ‘In early July of 59, Undersigned as "Fred" and
George Fill (SR Staffer) as tir. George" met Subiect and his.teammate

"AL" who arrived at Natl. Airport, D.C. with their. agent handler and
trainers. The group had returned from several weeks of survival

training in Alaska, and consisted of:

that''site until the operaticn was placed on indefinite conservation
and ultimately cancelled becaSue of the Powers U-2 incident, ©

F, | Safehouse keepers were an elderly married couple -
"Geof and Janie." There were approximately 6 DOB QP vehicles exposed

to Subject.

ACTION REQUIRLD ; REFERENCES: .

o

Po yedy WIROGUE, former REDSOX -agent candi@ate and African Division
agent has’ been quitclaimed and resettled on the local economy.
This ‘@ispatch summarizes the WIROGUE case from May 1962 to March

/Aain from the Congo on 22 May
r-establishing contact were dictated by
1 : t of his KUBARK-supplied false Austrian
passport, the need to institute. or suggest a course of action .
“which would encourage him to establish -himself as a contributing
member of society and, above all, prevent his return to the Congo.

3. Subject appeared to be primarily a resettlement problem,

therefore, Orme K, DARONNAT was assigned the Case Officer
responsibility. :

4. Since adequate documentation was a primary. consideration for

Successful resettlement, Subject was briefed on the relative merits
of the types of FEDREP-.documentation available. Although Headquarters
had recommended a backstopped Fremdenpass, subsequent discussions
““between DARONNAT ‘and MKTOPAZ FRAN representatives indicated a
‘Reiseausweis to be the proper document’ for, permanent resettlement,
. With the cooperation ‘of ODIBEX Camp King representatives, Subject
“was interviewed ahd granted political recognition on the basis of

a fabricated story”in. which he claimed to be a Georgian who defected
from East Berlin while with-a tourist group.

..5. The WIROGUE case suffered a temporary setback when in December
1962 the BUNDESVERFASSUNGSSCHUTZ (BFV), the West German organization
responsible for the internal security of the FEDREP became interested
in Subject and requested all available information, HARVARD briefed
OCA Bonn that Subject was strictly a HARVARD agent resettlement case
whose name, recognition interview story, etc were complete
fabrications to insure his receiving political recognition and a
Reiseausweis. OCA advised the BFV that Subject was of continuing AIS
interest and HARVARD resumed its resettlement efforts. 5 par?

6. By summer 1963 detailed South American immigration data
had been acquired. This disclosed.that Subject's language ;
deficiencies, backround, knowledge of the Soviet Union, and work

history were sufficient to guarantee his smooth processing
through the -I} RGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE FOR EUROPEAN MIGRATION’
CICEM).... Our investigation also pointed up the fact that until
Subject was provided with a detailed life history containing the
informétion required by prospective employers and/or immigration
authorities, he was not in a position to be resettled anywhere,
let:alone South America, As a-‘result, HARVARD's plans to process
“Subject for immigration had to be cancelled, at least temporarily.

7. cA CABEZONE Stage I C.O,. -was given the task of preparing a

_ life story containing the factual information needed for the filling

out of -job applications, to stand up under detailed interviews and,

_ aif South American immigration ever took place, to satisfy immigration

‘requirements. This legend was given: to.ODIBEX Camp King representa-
tives who ‘prepared a new political recognition interview story,

“ye arranged for the removal of copies of the old story from the various

|* “FEDREP files and replaced them with the new.

.- 8, For the. first,.time: since Subject had arrived in HARVARD's
custody the way was clear for a final resettlement. Subject’s

. Reiseausweis was renewed and he was quitclaimed and advised to
work and establish himself in Germany. He was told that nothing
more could be done for him and that immigration to South America
at anytime in the future would be without KUBARK assistance.

9, HARVARD has done everything to insure Subject a successful

future -free from problems resulting from his "black" association
with KUBARK, Therefore, there is good reason to believe that
KUBARK will not have to become involved with any of Subject's
“future problems. It is also unlikely he will attempt to coerce
KUBARK with threats to reveal all. With his criminal background

he is aware that he caw ‘be brought to’ the attention of the French

. authorities. He also believes that KUBARK's position in the FEDREP
is such that we have nothing to.fear from any action on his’ part. .

10, At the time of this writing Subject has a poSition as
research and development engineer with a Munich firm. He allegedly
receives DM 1500 per month, has an expense account and is to receive
a percentage of all profits realized’ from the sale of any devices
he develops. He expects to move to Munich permanently about the

end of May or June 1964,

Jl, HARVARD has arranged with CSB Data Processing Branch to
publish a noforn drop notice under Subject's documented name so
that any attempt to immigrate to any country will bring him to the
attention of KUBARK and appropriate action can be taken.

12, It is suggested that Headquarters arrange to apprise
HARVARD of any inquiries regarding Subject under his documented
name or any of the names listed in Attachment C, :

‘1. Reférenées represent an initial misunderstanding of. ff

the problen. of ‘WIROGUE’ whica is now being clarified,

The probiém of backstopping of reséttleneat ‘and

disposal:-cases has been carefully reviewed by elements of csB

concerned including CABEFONE; /MKTOPAZ and CATNINS.-.In thig

. Connection there is ‘attached 2 copy of a menorandun dated 27 |

- August-/1963 from -Ch ef/UKTOPA? which outlines the current ~
situation. As wilT ‘be noted URTOPAZ -has and vill expand its

. Capability for procurement of operational documents independent
of the 513th ICG. It ds believed that the present procedures

for backstopping of resettlexent and disposal cases should be

continued, In theory an independent capability is desirable

but not really practical at this ‘tine. Creation of an

independent capability for backstorping resettlement ‘cases

would require duplication of the procedures and practices now .-

. followed by Mr. Filims of the Sl3th ICG. In addition, we would .
not have the advantage of Hiding our cases from the Germans among
other Arsy. disposal cases, ‘Furthermore, USAREUR has requested

notification prior to contact with any German officials of any

Sensitive cases which we may desire to handle without military

assistance-~-see USAREUR letters dated 7 August 1961 and 25 March

19€2, attached. With considerable effort it would be possible:

‘to backstop some of our resettlement and disposal cases directly
“with German officials, It would be quict difficult, however, to
prevent the Army fro learniag of such action which is contrary
- to the USAREUR request,

. 3. It 4s possible that the PEDREP will enact new
legislation on the cantrol of non-Gernan refugees, Likewise,
new FEDREP energency laws may affect this type of case. We will
’ keep this situation under review and in the event the ecircun-

stances change will..inittate’ appropriate action,
