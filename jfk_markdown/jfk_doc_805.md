2RO. SER,

poc.™:

Reference; HMA 30540 of 10 November 1966

1. A PEQ Part II for LIRING*3 is being forwarded under separate
cover, It is to be noted that LIRING~3 has not been recruited in the
name of WOFACT, but instead is engaged in clandestine activities for
wallace B, ROWION, who LIBING=3 believes is a Greek businessaan with
international connections who requires economic, political and personality ©
infaemoeten ta arder to conduct his business.

2. The fact that LIRING-3 is not aware of his WOFACT ccanection, at
the present time, outveights the value which would accrue vere an attempt
made to make him knowledgeable. He performs clandestinely for ROWION
and he is actual.y attacking priority targets, In this way he works
against the target with # clear conscience and his left-wing sentiments
are not threatened, .

3. The operation is moving, however, toward the eventual full re-
eruitment of LIRING*3, bot it is moving slowly in that direction because
of the political and social beliefs of Subject. One advantage of this
falee flag recruitment of this individual, at the present tine, is the
fact that he is able to eater the target area without fear of capture and
exposure as an enemy agent. Under the present plan of operation he believes
hie work actually ia aiding the revolution which he believes in from an
idealistic standpoint.

MEMORANDUM:

b SUBJECT : Handling of LIRING-3 as Hostile Agent

: In view of Station Mexico City's statement in paragraph
6 of MEXI 8944 (IN 23093), which presumably comes from
| , LIRING-3's handler Wallace B. ROWT§N, to the effect that
LIRING-3 "still has strong anti-U.S. feelings". the time, has
come to review the Lintie-3/one 4 mm the same cable. the Station
sey forth several control elements including true name receipts
‘and taps made in ROWTAN'S safetouse of LIRING-3's amourous :
sessions with @ young art stutent What avvears to be lacking: A,
wet considering the case ‘as the handling of a double agent,
Cecitey nostite, gis “ yomework—-that is to say, that there are
certain actions that should be taken in the case as follows:
a. Placing of. a phoze tap on L-3's telephone, if
it can be determined that he has a telephone. ,
b. Intercept: of all mail going to LIRING-3's home .~
address. , ,
of. c: Physical ‘and photo ‘surveillance of L-3 to determine
‘ any patterns of actions or contacts with ‘suspicious persons. , aif
L-3's contacts and actions agree with what L-3 tells ROWT@N and
to allow ROWTQ@N to be prepared to cover himself in his relations
|} with Le3. _
dad. To discrefbly investigate L-3's sources of ,income, :
i.e., to see if his income from teaching art classes (and more .
recently from his wife's salary from “Yonene) are sufficient to.

account for his scale of living, whatever it is.

Foote

There are indications in the file that: the “homework”

as outlined above has not yet been done. The Station was
pig i564 mad
queried in DIR 39039, and in DIR- O144! as to the above matters.
It ig noted in MEXICO CITY- Saqy that the Station said that
it did not as yet have "independent checks" on this agent,
beyond evidence of entry to the Cuban Embassy furnished by
LIONION photo surveillance, and in fact had only his word on
Tt pAbatdinn Corda, radence »

claimed actions and statements. ani that LIENVOY and LITAINT-2
confirm that L-4, L-3's wife, is definitely employed as a
secretary to LIRING-1 as claimed by L-3. The Station tended to
doubt that L-3 is a Cuban plant but said that even if he were,
that it was no additional risk (the Station was reforring ¢
a proposed trip by 3 to Cuba) since L-3 would be provided with

= suitable uncheckable “explanation as to how L-3 obtained info

on ‘the LOPEZ case.

e. Check as suggested in DIR 07441 on status of

J}

LIRING-4's father, who is presuzably a Chinese, repurtedly in
the United States. This is of interest in view of stringent

G.S. entry requirements laid on Chinese. :

La Fiastica Mexicana in the hope of running into Subject s0 thet he
could renew contact more or less casually.
2. Fortunately as soon es he sterped into the door he found subject
engaged in conversation with the receptionist and another person (pro-
‘bably e Hexican employe of the Salon). ‘shen Subject spotted howton he
breke off his conversaticn and moved away to greet Rowton cordially. le
said thet he had himself gust arrived cat the Salon end was very ha. py
to run into Newton again, After a few Bri¢f remarks, he invited xovton
to coffee in a nearby cats. iiowton accepted and they both left the Ja-
Lom alilead Surtle, deley. ,
3. Rowton remained with Suzject in sonvergation over coffee for about
45 sinutes. Subject expressed erutification in having set Rowton and
several times reassured xowton that he enjoyed conversiog vith hin re-
gerdless of vhether he ssce un sale of his painting or not. Rowton re=
‘verted to the these that he had s genuine interest in wubject's future
and hoped in some way to provide Jubject.with the means of becoxing ree
letively independent so tzat he could travel and carry cn his art work
freely. novton added thet he had ¢iven much thourht to the idea, of using
Subject to belp hin in his econo-ic research, since this would justify
Rowton's publisg Subj ¢4 on his ex; ense account. He then cuestioned Sub-
ject on nis’ possible cornections in Mexico, but Subject confessed that
-he had only limited ccntacts thet protably wo 1d sot be useful to Rowton.
Rowton then moved into the target question. He stuteé ti.t noat of ais
clients in -nglond, Frence and Crsece were i:.terested in Cuban require~
_ ments and perhaps Subject was in a unique position to prepare a report
on what the Cuban econenr required at the moment. Subject responded with
out hestitation that he could do something on Cuba without too mich .if-
fioulty. He expisined th.t he knew official Cuba bn Lexico City, in-
cluding those in’ the Conaercial idssion, end could travel into Cuba if
“necessary. .
4, Roxton then. stressed tact he really did not necd too many statis tio”
on the Cuban econony. ner eontact with the Cubans but wanted somehow. to
Justify helping subject. fin ancielly. He expleined that he could easily
