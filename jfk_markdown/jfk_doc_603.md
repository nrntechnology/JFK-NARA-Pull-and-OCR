cross box,

2, Specifically, tt is destred ro have the capabiltty of recognizing which
cable terminals ina box are being used for telephone tapplag without having any

concerning the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation with coverage of both individuals
and their daily activitles, . .

(3) LIFEAT/Yugoslav Besides the usua lL coverage of day-to-day
activitles of the official installation, LIFEAT leads have Indicated the possi-
bility of a successful recruitment of'a Mexican employee of that installation,

excellent overall service, plus its ability to provide unUateral coverage of

notice), make LIFEAT a dependable daily contributor to the fulfilling of the-
Station" 8 mission,

2. VILSTep omphasized that the whole telephone systen in Yexteo

has sub-contracted this work of cleaning up and reorganiaing the phono
system to the independent firs, Intel. They are cloorirg uw unused and

point we now occupy.

WILSTED proposed that this will mean ve can again use arertesnta since

_ we-can siphon off a lino dastined for use by another tenant in such a

way that the phone company cannot truce ite destination without tearing

‘the building apart ‘and we can then insta) a sazarate line to the build-

pick up coverage of his replacement Svyatoslav F, KUZNE (SGV, The contin-
ucd coverage of sleksandr G, SIDOROV, which includes extensive periods of
live- monitoring ‘and special process ing of the take, is considered essential to
those Station-assets involved in the attempt to place the technical surveillance

Office continues to provide interesting personality data on Soviet officials
assigned to Mexico, :

(2) LIFEAT/POLISH LIFEAT coverage in support of the
BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation continues to be vital to that operation, Addi-
tional coverage for. this operation has been undertaken, leads from which will

: probably determine furure direction of the operation as well as aid KUBARK in

During the early part of August 1962 a group of ' “coyotes” Was uncovered
in the telephone company in Mexico City and a number of arrests were made,
This group had organized a unit including linemen, centralmen, installation |
crew, Warehousemen, and workers In the office responsible for providing ser-
vice to new clients, It was the-purpose of the "coyote"”.group to provide service,
fora price, ‘o those individucts whose requests for ins:allations had been turned
down by che telephone company due to limited availability of cables and contacts,
(Note: 2 company génerally keeps a certain number of "spare pairs” in each
cable for its own use in providing special service, company phones, and for re-
routing during repairs co other cubles, It was these spare pairs and contacts
which the “coyotes” used to provide illegal phone service.) This telephone com-
pany within the telephone company would also collect monthly fees from their
“subscrifers", When the story came out, ihe telephone cunmipany had special

‘police siationed in each central and spot checks made of linemen and crews to -
preven: recurrence, [t was thereiore necessary for the LIFEAT linemen to
refrain from any clandestine activity for a period of almios: four weeks so as
not to be accidentally picked up as a member of the “coyote” group, LIFEUD-1

details and special checkups terminated, No compromise of ihe LIFEAT oper

after.a long period uf family disagreemcits, have tnutually decided on a
divorce, Both are being terminated by KUBARK since their usefulness as
basehouse keepers for the project will end with their divorce, The agents have
agreed to the termination and it-will be accomplished vu a friendly basis,
(Ageut Service Records will be forwarded), Therefore, it has been necessary
to close Annex VI and terminate coverage of the lines provided by that base-
house, LIFEUD-24 and LIFEUD-26 have been recruited to replace the ter-
minated couple and are-presently looking for a suitable basehouse which could
fully replace ihe uld Annex VI.. (Note: POA was granted for LIFEUD-24 on 28

A, Exploitation of Leads

(1) LIFEAT/SOVIET LIFEAT coverage in this area was concentrate

‘on known RIS officers: Vladimir G, NOVIKOV and Aleksandr G, SIDOROV.
The most rewarding lead from thts coverage during July was chat SIDOROV
would be absent with hts enttre family .from his apartment for nearly two
Months, and more importantly, that no ong would be convinuously watching
the apartment during diat time, Based on thts information, the Station has
deen able to make the necessa ry preparations for establishing technical

* surveillance of this apartment, LIFEAT coverage of the Sovtec Bullecin

Office, in addition to the above coverages, has provided information on the

< daily activities of Individual Sov tet officlals assigned to Mexico, including

collection of travel and biographical data,

(2) LIFEAT/POLISH LIFEAT coverage has been vital to the
BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT has even provided live- monitoring
‘ofan. international call to BECHICK from z former admirer, Also in the
Polish area, LIFEAT provided aames of Polisi: Embassy contacts who were
invited to Polish national holiday celebrations at the Polish Embassy, as
well_as information concerning the impeading arrival of the new Polish Am-
bassador,

No change,

D, Security

No security incidents directly affecting the operation or future of
LIFEAT were noted ducing July 1962, The assignment of special telephone
company crews to make a survey of spare telephone Lines available for
use of new subscribers may cause problems when these crews uncover a
“spare” tine used‘in a LIFEAT coverage, However, sincé these crews
have no authority (or dcstre) to’trace down the lines to thetr ultimate
destination, normal LIFEAT security pracitces should negate this danger,

j | A second development which could cause future problems is the possible
assignment ofa LIENVOY technician to check telephone ceatrals to sze
exactly who else may be carrying on LIENVOY iype work, -As of this date
LIFEAT personel, who have been provided with the crue name of thts
individual, have never heard of him working in any central in Mexico City,
As of this moment it appears ‘this will not develop into a thréat to ‘
LUFEAT operations, . , . a

E. Technical

New recorders provided in May.to LIFEAT are now in operation and
appear superior to previous models used, It is planned, with the approval
of Project LUFEAT for FY 1963, to completely re-equip LIFEAT with new
recorders and possibly dial tape recorders, .— -

As a continulay asect, LIFRAT ‘provided daily netice: ‘of -
the activities and movements of Polish officiais. In cne case
LIFFAT provided advance informaticnh cenecrning travel plans of
cone Jan, KRZYAICEL, ‘a person or, the Polish Watch ‘Tet. ?

(3) During tne reporting period LIFEAT added to the security

of the Station in checking on rresent and past apent assets. Of.
particular note was ‘the coveraje of the activities. cf LIFIRE, 7

~ *LIVESTOCKeL, and LIVESTOCK <2.

{&) Until terminated for scourity reasons (see SEC-RITY, :
below), LISTAT orveraze of the I'A.R. Frbassy provided inderendent
> 7 check of the activitleas nf the manbers of that inrtallation. Of
nots were the LIFTAT revealed mectings between Vicente LOMBARDO ©
Toleduno, former Mexican President Lazaro CARDINAS and:the previous:

‘teAe2e Ambassador Anouar NAT!M. This coveraze also provided infor=’
; mation ecne-rning the vielt of an Algerian retel delegation to
= Boxicos :

(5) LIFEAT provided coverage of the local Comzunists, the
“Amorican Comuunist Group in Mexico (AQUM}, and lately on two
inportant Canadian Communists Uving in Mexico. In ita coverage

of lecal Conminists LIP=AT provided coveraje of Carmen [RUFAU
Civit (admitted former Sovict a.eat), Xavier CUERIRD Saucedo
and hie wife, Clara Porcet de CUEUVERO, and Juan Lais CA“POS
yillalotos. LIFEAT provided lcaJs indicated the place of enploy=—
"ment of BRUFAU, as well as much of her dally routine, thereby

allowing the Station to initiate rhysical survcillance of her.
LIFEAT coverage of CA!POS, of interest to the Station's Communist
Party Penetration Progran, revealed his insincerity in cooperating
with KUUARK, and as a refult efforts toward his full recruitment
weve terminated with minimin danger to Station assets. Recently,
at Headquarters request, LIF/AT reinitiated its coverage of the
GUERREHOS. This coverage has already provided information of the.

continuing contact between the SUERHEOS and Frank and Libby z,
‘PARK, Canadian Communist "inmisrantes" to Mexico and members of ag
the Lator Prozresatva Party (Canadian cP). The Station hopes to. See

mount a more com:rehensive coverage of the PARKS as a result of ©
the LI7FAT lead, In the LIFSAT coverage of the ACtH, of parti-
cilar interest was the advance travel plans of Albert MALTZ, Noah
and Anna SES0PER (as well as the travels of their scns Carl and ©
Robert, SFBORERN), Marta and Mos WICK, and Grace and Sam NOVICK,
Dally activitien of the ACM are provided through LIFEAT to the
local office of ODFNVY. -

_ (6) The IIFFAT complex provided the security check of the
private office telephon:s of the Chief of Station and Deputy
Chief of Stution, as well as checks of the home televhones of :
certain of the Station officers (as recorted ia I0SU=16h65).
Since this service is unique and of value to Station sserity,
it will be utilized perisdically to jum'd against hostile audio
surveillance. .

month of June was the acquisition of leads on the activities uf Cuban “tourist” *
Francisco DELGADO Garcia. Asa result of these leads, passed to the
Mexican governmen: in disguised form, DELGADO-was arreasted on the aight

‘of 7 July and thereafter deported.” LIFEAT information also enabled the
responsible Case Ofticer to alert agent LIMASK to threats made by DELGADO
to have LIMASK arrested, She LIERODE related owerage of the telephone cf

these ww ope cations,

we Ds ; A problem which has arisen with the withdrawal of the
- ‘Soviet coverage-from LIFEAT responsibility (sec ‘SECURITY below) and the
“outage” expecienced earlier in June on two of the most productive Soviet
_ lines, is the extreme drop in the production of posizive intelligence from
LIFEAT covesage. It ts hoped that. with more Liensive exploitation of the
coverage still available, plus explyitationof new lines being installed by LIFEAT,
“that the production of positive dntelligence will again measure up to that previously

Sg ae No change other than the closer inter-oftice liaison with
Project LIENVOY due to the above noted LIFEAT Processing of LIENVOY take
and the increased reel and finished product exchange this ‘entails, .

* On 21 June 1960 LITENSOR suggested to OOS that LIENVOY
begin operations against the Soviet-and Satellite targets in Mexico City. In
order not to indicate that the unilateral LIFEAT operation was providing this
coverage, it was necessary for COS to agree to this suggestion. So ag not to
Jeapordize LIFEAT operations and personnel, LIFEAT coverage was suspended
on the Soviet Embassy and Polish Legation, and the applicable “crogsea” were
pulled and cleaned, This was accomplished by 1030 on 22 June 1960, Coverage
continued‘on the home of Aleksandr BEKIER, Pollsh Conselor of Legation, since
no security problem seemed to be raised by continued coverage of this line.

REF: HA(MA-15170, RYRAT-1402

” On.the evening of LS June COS met with LITENSGR at the home at LTELEGANT
(see MEXI-5761), Among other subjects discussed, LITENSOR urgently
suggestod thar OGS arrange coverage of the Soviet/ateliza installations,

Since this coverage lu obviously one of great interest to KUBARK, COS wae

left with no alternative bur to cuthuslistically accept LITENSO's suggestion,
LIELEGANT was equally enthuslastle about the suggestion and requesied COS

‘to furnish a Ust of target Mnes as coon as possible. On 21 June Malcolm QQ. _
EDELAND passed to LIENVOY/2 a ILst of 4 Soviet, 2 Polisi, 2 Czech and 2 Yugo-
slav lines. The Polish, the Czech, Yugoslav and! Soviet line were placed witiin
two days. Meanwhile-all LIFEAT Sovict/Satellite Ines were removed, After
due consideration lt was decided to advise LIENVOY/2 that we would prefer to
drop the 2 Polish Mags and ut least one Yugoslav Ine ond use all remalalog
avatlable lincs (LIENVOY can handle a maximum of 30 Hace, always keeping

‘two spares) to cover a total of five Sovict Hines and keeplag the two Czech [pea
already ia operation. This was agreed to but the four additional Sovler lines
could nat be placed immediately due to the temporary absence from the city of
LIENVOY/3 whose aid was needed to ful{ll tila assignment,

The eventuality of a request from high Mexican officials for LIENVOY coverage
of Soviet/Satellire with tra attendant affect upon LIFGAT bad been forescen by
the Station for sometime. On at least two previous occasions when a hint wag
made to OOS by lesser officials than LITENSO2, COS waa able to disguade
these officials on the bugis of lack of qualified personnel for processing, trana-
ertbing, and exploking the take that would come from taps against Sovtet/ .
Satellte installations, However, an the above occasica when LETENSOR evea
went 8o far.as to suggest that the translations could be haadled by language
experts st Headquarters COS wa: in no pasition to argue thls polit with.
LITENSOR, ‘The uctual.imprementation of the change over of Sovier/Satellite
coverage from LIFEAT to LEENVOY (LIKEAT went back on Polish Legatton in
late June) waa accomplished smoothly, with no flapa and the Starlon does not en-

visien any prodlems, certainly, in the lymedlate haure..

The processtag and transertbing ts belng handled in exactly ti same fashlon as
' before t.e., LIENVOY Is doing the taps only, LIFEAT persounel are processing
the tapes from LUENVOY. Ag far as die Mexicans are concerned, the tapes are
belng forwarded to iieadquarters for Processtug with the transcriptions being
- gent back to the Station for our information,. The Station bas promtsed
LIENVCY/2 and LIELEGANT a monthly summary of auy iterating alghlights
that appear tn these cranscriptions, - , :

b, Processing of Mats Material

During the month of May 1960, the quantity of raw informacton
. processed was noticeably reduced, and thus the amount of positive intelligence
derived was also reduced, due ro the “outage” on certaia of che most producr Wwe
LIFEAT lines; Principally Involved were the Sovtet lies, including one week
break on aa Embassy line, three weeks on the Soviet Motion Picture Office line,
and one week on the Soviet Commercial Office liae, ‘These "outages" were
pr imarily due to the telephoae company pulling the LIFEAT crosses, or the
target telephone beiag out of order,

c. Liaison

"As in the past, the only liaison connected with Project LIFEAT is
‘in passing reels from coverage of the American Communists. in Mexico to”

KENORANIL! FOR: C/W4/3/Mextco
SUBJECT? LIFEAT

1 During my recent visit te veitco I hada geod chance to go
over many of the ins-and-outs of this project with the Case Officer
and with other officers in the Station. At Station staff.meeting I -
stated that reporting on CI uaterial derived from thu project was .
inadequate and COS appeared to so along with this view, The concensus
I sot. fram the Case Officers was that the 52 Case Officer is not
sufficiently alert to the need for reporting on the CI aspects of
tha matter and is limiting hinself to strictly servicing SR. Division
matturs, Various Case Officers cited instances to me of conversations
pointing to new clandestine relationships or containing previously
known clandestine relationships in the Soviet field which have not
been reported. © Owing to a lack of time, I was unablo to examine the
records myself, but I am inclined to accept those statements as true,

2. The Case Officer gave ne a general run-down of the situation
of tho agents on this project ani it appears that everything is running
‘Ho told me that in Nis new project outline, which will
be up. in a week or two, he is including some raises to some of the
agents, He told me that on his iast round of pay raises he had sane
difficulty hero at headquarters. If any difficulty scens forthcoming
this time, I should like to have the matter brought to my attention
‘because, as you know, I feel very strongly on this matter and fought
the sano battlos. with heagquar ters for at least five years,

‘3, In speaking with the Case Officers on thé Cuban side, as well
as on the CI, it was apparent that LIFFAT remains probably the bigzest
single source of information available to the Mexico Clty Station
and that every effort should be nace to continue its smooth functioning,
If this means .a couple of hundred pesos increase to each agent semi-annually
or annually, it does not seem ta te too much of a strain and T do act
see why we should have any troutie. When I compare the salaries of
the base operators and processers cn this project, especially consicering
the illegal position they are in, with those of relatively unproductive
agents elsewhere in Yexico and Fey sany other Stations, I cannot help
but feel that we are buying a creat deal for our money in this project.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: DESRIEFING OF LATID M. WILSTED (ps)

1. On ‘2D June 1960 Mr. John 3. Heyn and Mr. John Kennedy of WHD,

Mr, Robert Brown of CI/OPS, “Mr. Robert Bryant of FI/OPS and Mr. Charles

Bray of FI/D met with Navid M4. WILSTED (ps),

2. WILSTED emphasize4 that the whole telephone system in Mexico
City is undergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos da Mexico, S.A.,
has sub-contracted this work of. cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
system-to the indepandent ‘firm, Intel, They are cleaning up unused and .
old lines, putting in new asd Spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
laying underground cables » etc. Eventually we should be botter off da-
cause there should be, more surplus lines, Tha. renovation work has.
hampered much’ of the LIFZAT work, principally because many of the lines
now .are underground .and' we cannot get access to them beforo they enter
tho central, This is particularly true with respect to the Czech Eme
bassy, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
point we now occupy, : uo.

3. WILSTED ssid that we try to keep track of the activities of

"Intel" but since they seex to attack "Colonias” at random, we hava no

prior waming of thei prasence in a ccrtain areas

he In the recent past, “exico hes been using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. - de have more control over the access of

* phone company inspectors or repairman’ to houses. However, under new

regulations, all new aparteert Sulldings must have telephono lines ine
stalled in ‘the ‘building by tae phone company during the construction

phaso, This means that tng lines’ and'their destination are concealed.
WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again uso apartments since

we con siphon .off a line dastined for use by another tenant in such a

way that the phone Company carmot trace its destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then jistall a soparate line to the build-
ing and hook up the subsertter' to this, line which, if checked, will
belong to a legitimate subscriber, : i . :

5. -One system which has been usad effectively is to take ons-half

' of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two half”

pairs then fora one geod pair shich wa can use,
6- WIISTESD explainad that it cost about 3000 pesos to get a

" regular telephone. This entsila the purchase of a telephone company

bond, which later can be sold.

8, The taxe from each basshousa is collacted early in the morning
before office hours by RiFANELLI. He only enters ona basehouse which is
occupied ty sn elderly couple. Alt other contacts are in automobiles .
SLL then takes ths
material to s seeting betwaen hin, WILSTED and S where RaFaNSLLI

plans for the days :

section Vv, paragraph 2 (d) (1):

Exploitation. of L ads

: ° Thi: LIMERICK ‘phase of the LIFEAT operation is able
continuously to provide the interested case officers with background personality
information on the members of th vier Embassy staff, as well as travel infor-

-ination on Sovier officials and diplomatic courlers, During the month of April

1960, this type of information was exploited for the following:

-a) Viktor Nikolayevich GLOTOV, First Secretary,
will be the replacement for Viadimtr Geargiyevich NOVIKOV
as Cultural Officer when the latter leaves for the USSR on ~
29 May 1960. He will also act as the Soviet Ambassador's
executive Secretary, during the home leave of Vladimir Ivan-
.ovich CHERNYSHEV, CHERNYSHEV departed for leave °

“7 Aprile . ; L

b) Nikolai ZHOUGANOV was the replacement fox’!
-Anatolly Konstaitinovich YEMELYANOV, Commercial |;
Offtce employee who works “upstairs” {n the Chancellery.
rather than in the Commercial Office, ‘This indicated
‘that ZHOUGANOV may bea code clerk, |

c) Confirmation that four’ falfens are ape in the
Chancery as teachers, one of whom teaches English,

d) Indications uf increased contact between the Soviet
and Cuban officials as noted in the travel of Soviet officers
to Havana and conversations berween the Cuban Embassy +
and the Soviet Ambassador indicating an announcement of

’ importance was to. be made on 8 May, possibly concerning,
the establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba:
aid the USSR,

e) Through the review of past LIFEAT traffic and
the direct statements of the Soviet Embassy personnel in
discussions of "duty rosters", it has been determined that :
a reduction in the Embassy staff is in progress. Future) +
LIFEAT information should disclose whether this reduction
ts of a permanent or temporary nature. boa

: ‘f Advance travel notice on Soviets, such as cuarivistiay.
NOVIKOV, Semcon FEDOROV, and couriers Y ladimir BYKOV
and Valentin KUZNETSOV.

LIFEAT/LIMERICK also revealed a serious rift which has :
developed between the Soviet Commercial Office and one of its primary commercial

contacts, -Mony DESWAAN, over the latter's failure to pay the Soviets for two
“shipments of Russfan form tractors for which DESWAAN has received pavinient
from the Mexican Goveratent, the ultimate purchaser, LIFEAT indicates
DESWAAN has made himself unavailable to the Soviets since two of his checks
have “bounced” for lacks of funds. LIFEAT further noted that the Soviets are
concerned over reports that DESWAAN ts planning an carly summer trip to
Europe with’his entire family, . :

- . LIMERICK. provided valuable support to the Station's AEIMPULSE
operation ly furnishing detailed tnformation,on the DeSwaan and Esteve Brothers
‘commercial dealings with the Soviets, It was.also employed, as a security device
after the conclusion of the above operation: |. ro

ae we : ‘Leads were provided on two properties of Interest to the Soviets, -
Calle Mazatlan #208 and ‘Calle Chilpancingo #13, which were a valuable contribution
to'the LIMESA Project, . Lo

il) “LIFEAT/LITMUS was the source of information on the arrival in

_ and departure from Mexico City of Polish officials Jozef WINEWICZ, former
Polish Ambassador to Washington, and Boleslaw JELEN,

. {I} LIFEAT/LUERODE continued to provide excellent operational
leads concerning Cuban-and exile operations, Of particular note was the ability
of Station Mexico to warn an ODACID officer of a possible “walk-in" provocation
-attcmpt by an agent of the Cuban Embassy, LIERODE also provided informatton
on four American-citizens who entered Mexico on their way to Honduras to join

- an anti-Somoza revolutionary attempt.

b, Processing of Material

Although the LIFEAT project must be considered primarily a
Station support project, an effort to further exploit LIFEAT for positive
intelligence has been made by assigning the assistant case officer the task of
coordinating the efforts of the appropriate area case officers and the Station
reports officer in matters concerning LIFEAT produced tnformation, Although

+. this system has been tested only during the month of AprU, it is hoped that it

will prove of value in increasing the Positive Intelligence take from LIFEAT
provided material, .

- No change was made In the manner of processing the raw LIFEAT
recls during the month of April, .

c. Liaison
+

. As in the past, the only liaison connected with Project LIFEAT
is in passing reels from coverage of the American Communists in Mexico te
GDENVY for their processing, No other liaison is considered necessary or

desireable, :
d, Security. .

LIFEAT/LIVERY continued to remain out of operation due to the
extensive telephone company installation and renovation work being carried on
in the vicinity of the LIVERY basehouse. No definite date can be given for the
