“TF 28 June 1965
“oO STEBOKY JAGUAR d f RE: “433° — (CHEK “x OND)
JAGUAR Report of STEBONY Surveillance

1. Pursuant to the suggestion contained in DIR 04341, 23 April 1965,
we asked JAGUAR to lay on such coverage as they could manage. After some
weeks has pareed, and JAGUAR had not moved in this direction, we repeated
our request, pointing out that STEBCNY/1 would soon be leaving. Short=
handed and hampered by certain restriotions, JAGUAR moved in to do what
they could, and their coverage was due to start almost at the same time
as TIFFANY was to begin his meetings with s/t. We contacted JAGUAR and
told them to lay off (much to our chagrin) for the time being. This they _
did, but then, without our ‘being advised, they resumed their coverage.

We don't know exactly how long they actually had him in their sights,
but they have now given us a letter (text below) suggesting that he was
watohed on 5, 6 and 7 June. A JAGUAR officer advised us informally
that S/1 "seemed to be out-of tom" for one or two days. (TIFFANY had
mentioned that he might take S/1 to the country for a day, but we don't
know whether in fact he did so.) . .

- 2. Here is JAGUAR's notes

"as explained in conversation on the 8th June, 1965, we :
have received a report on S/1's movements during the period 5th — iy
Ith June, 1965. Nothing of interest was learnt about his movenents a
on the 6th and 7th June, but you may be interested in the following i
information relating to the 5th Junet —- i

. ®s/1 left his home at 11.25 and travelled by taxi to
. . the Haymarket where he entered the American Express offices. fe
~ He obtained a ticket for an air passage to Brussels and :
a train journey to Basle, thence to Lausanne and Paris where
he was due to arrive on the 10th June. He paid £20-29-14
_ for his ticket. He left the Amerioan Express at 12.30 and
subsequently returmmed home at 13.20 hours. --

"He left home again at 14.05 and went to the Clarendon
Court Hotel in Maida Vale. He came out of the building
after five minutes and wandered around for twenty minutes
before returning to the hotel. He stayed there until 18.45
when he left alone and returned home. '

3. The JAGUAR officer also told me that 3/1"s contact at the Clarendon .
Court Hotel was not identified by the surveillant, who in fact did not
know which room S/1 had visited. The contact, of course, was TIFFASY, i
registered as GUSTKE. . i

1. Attached are selected extracts from BAIRN reports. BAIRN
is a very sensitive SMOTH operation, and the items should be treated
accordingly.

2, Maro SCHLEIFFER (misspelled in BATRN) is of interest. Pablo
is Pable FERNANDEZ, Cultural Attache at the Cuban Umbassy in London.
Other items should be self-explanatory. On page 3 of the attachment,
"integration", where underlined, should read "segregation."

3. As with these iteas, London will try to bring to Head~
quarters (and other addressees') attention STEBONY-related items that
we notice. On the other hand, ye-do not require to be info’ed on all
-STEBOWY_traffio in the future, We yould like to see copies of all of
hia intelligence reporting, whether for passage to the SMOOTHERS or not.
Qn that topic, we would like to recommend that a liberal policy be
followed in determining yvbat of his stuff to pass to liaigzon here. We
will be glad to review his reporting for passage, if there is doubt about
whether to pass it. We would also like to see any materials relating to
= him that may havea bearing on London Station operations, relating
principally to the U.K., or relating to any of our liaison services here,
of course. .

SUBJECT: “Telephone Conversation Malcolm X - Carlos Moore aad
Sandy Bethuve, (Afso-American Unity Group in Paris) \

t. Forwarded herewith as A:tachment is a Xerox copy of a
photosta: cf s transcript of a telephone coaversation between Carlos
Moore (and bis friend saady Bethune) and the late Malcolm X, which
took place & or § February 1945. cUGAR obtained this transcript
on 4 Juas from the ecitor of the West Indian Gazette, (fnu} Manchanda.
SUGAR believes that Manchancs got the photostat {rom the Ghana High
Commission office in London, He further believes that the Afro-
American anity group in Paris (among whom there is only one member
with U. 5. citizenship: the American Negro photographer, John Tayler)
probably eapplied the transcript to the Ghana officials as 8 means of
buliding their credentials ag a bona fide revolutionary orgenization,
perhaps one entitled to receive financial sapport.

2. SUGAR gave the current (June 1965) acdrese of Jamaican/Cebaa
Carlos Moore as: c/o Pedro Filipe, 168 Rue Grenelle, Paris 7e, France.
SUGAR said that Filipe is a Cubsa national.

1. Following is the full text of the JAGUAR letter, a part of
which was transmitted under refs

"We have received the following two items of- intelligence
about S/1s

1, Some time in May this year, S/1 said that he would
be going to Tunisia on 15th June to work on the staff of the
paper "L'action."

2. after his quarrel with Jacques VERGES in 1964, s/1
rexeived &200 as “personal finanoial assistance” from Jacques
GRIPPA, the leader of the pro-Chinese Communist faction in
Belgium. Hils ANDERSSON also gave him financial help.

Our sources were not able to say when the financial assistance
was given to S/1 but presumably that from CRIPPA was made
available some time between July and November last year."

2. 8/1 reported to Station in Hay that he had had an offer of
& job on L'Action, but there was no intention of his accepting it. ‘

3. London has some doubts about whether 8/1 in fact received this
much money from GRIPPA. We suspect that he has told people thie to enhance
his stature as a “Chinese agent"; we still wonder, though, what funds he
may have been covering this way, sinoe we had not contacted him as of the
tine in question. Perhaps, as a result of ref, LCPIPIT may shed some
light on this point.

4. We see no reason for Lorden Station to retain this copy in the

some other addressee. Sixilariy, we slan to destroy our copy of the rouss
transcript of the debriefing (previously forwarded under OLLA 42,706, 9 Marca

O J4GUah Urficer*s Coment on Urabtul/1 ana fiw

1. In the course of an informal discussion on ° June with the JAGUAR
officer most faniliar with the history of STEBOHY/1 (and our relationship
with hin), the JAGUAR officer commented that he was frankly surprised at
the volume of sexual activity of the African Communista and far~leftiste.
His first reference was to types such as Jeanne PYEOR, but he broadened
the comment toinclude Rosalynde AINSLIS and others, and of course there
were the recipients of these girls’ affections as well — africans (usually
Black) such ae Kenyatta and abu.

2. The JAGUAR officer then added that 3/1's wife was also know t
have shared her favors with other black men than 3/1 — to such an extent:

at any rate, that her promiscuity had come to JAGUAR’s notice. (I montioned
that this must be some new news, since we had not heard of it before, but

he indicated that this was old news, and apparently not of the type to be

- Oonsidered "dercgstory.") The JAGUAR officer vent on to say that S/1 hin--
self hap put in s certain amount of time in the bode of other white girls,
and perhaps this is how he knows of the promiscuous propensities of soae

of then.

3e While S/1 bas not particularly affeoted prudery in our talks, neither
has be professed himself to be a great and universal lover.

ity and living pattern of Subject which we hope will be helpful to COVERDALS
im mounting an eventual reoruitzent approache

Be Subject is emarting with desire for revenge against those who have
cut him off from ali meaningful political activity and probably
~—--.. _ from a eource of income as well. (NOTZs Subject told 5/1 that

him scone money.

db. an intellectual, Subject has never been particularly effootive in
the arra of psactioal organisational politicos. He is rather weak
in the sense that in a conflict situation he tends to pull back.
In other words he is not eggressive by nature. At the same tine,
3/1 felt certain that Subjeot’s indignation and desire for revenge
were deeply seated in his emotions and ke woulé not be able to

rationalise away these feelings.

Sn. Subject is basically a friendly and courteous person.

@. Subject has mixed feelings towards OnI?PA, but ruost is his
desire to rohabilitate himself with the Blgian teenielters” It
is thought that if someone telephoned Subject and made reference to

most. likely come out for a neeting. :

for hia to leave the job for an hour or. two without anyone becozing

able to provide ea great deal of information despite his having
been pushed aside from active and direct participation in recent

2. Baesd on tho forogeing, the best ploy for getting at Subject might
be a telephono call to his place of work with che ca.ier asing a cover
pretext for meeting hin alone and deforring all detailed questions to such
@ Ascting on the grounds of not vanting to discuss these over the telephone.
If this gets Subject cut, then COVsRDALS could apologise for the sinor

, from New York of a flat turn-down on his offer to serve as

| "s chief editor Leo Hubermann 1
i ; plans to attend 2nd Bandung himself. Locally, however, S/1 =
iT “ee | was able to line up the following sponsors (though none is .
i? in a position to pay much for his services they collectively .
i - Provide him with sufficient reason for being in Algiers; he ad

will let on that his travel costs were advanced him by his
wealthy brother-in-law):

: pondence, will provide S/l with a letter of accreditation. --

c. Institute of Race Relations. This volitically
neutral, academic outfit publishes a monthly newsletter.
Connected with Chatham House, tue Institute's secretary,
Sheilla Paterson is a good friend of S/l. She has asked

7 him to do a paper back book for the Institute on Africa.
Again, though they could pay little for tnis effort it i
constitutes a highly respectable piece of cover. . a

enue eese tee th se

_, During the last two months, S/l has explained his income . ott
to his wife as coming from advances, expense money and articles
for Encounter. This has not pleased her, as she dislikes i
both the Congress for Cultural Freedom and Laskey, but has
at least satisfied ner curiosity. To explain Katzenbach's
-{-- telephone calls to his home (K. identified himself to S/l's

| wife xxe as"Mr. Wilson") S/1 had to improvise a purely

. Notional affiliation with an American feature story syndica-

tion serviceicalled "Metropolitan Features". This will help

explain some of his iname to his wife, but will not be used
— with others.

. 2. The above skeletal dover will hovefully be reinforced in
Algiers where S/1 will scour around for bits and pieces of work _
_ for his many contacts there. His visits to Grippa and Andersson .
on his way to Algiers will also help to fill out his ostensible
sources of income, though S/1 has agreed not to overplay this
~ angle. In other words, he will not pretend that Shese two have ~~
given him any funds, but if others want to make the assumption, -
-- 80 much the better. . . eee

"13. On 1 and 2 June, Tiffany expounded at some length on the |
importance of S/l trying to get an Opposition (Soviet, Cuban,
Algerian or ChiCon) sponsor for any further cover, such as :

’ the researching of a book or establishment of an Arro-Asian -
news service for U.S. leftist periodicals and/or individuals.
While we could easily set him up in this enterprise, we tes'not -
went to for the simple reason that this would at best only

. Provide him with a superficial sort of access. What we want
him to strive for is Opposition sponsorship that will lead hin

. ‘into one of the nerve centers of the national liberation
i movement in Algiers or Djakarta. (S/1 ruled out Cairo on the
| grounds that his wife is Jewish) S/1 accepted this reasoning

and agreed to go for a position that holds out the prospect of =;

hit it off well from the outset, the latter's knowledge of Paris and
Tangiers-based American beatniks and other intellectuals serving hin
well in the rapport-building process, Rodigast juss on firm
meeting arrangements for Paris and has discussed arrangements for

JAGUAR had made the following available to us, in response to our
request for information on a continuing basia relating to sTz30Ny/ 1s

“In mid-May STEBONY/1 was still trying to arrange a visit to
Algiers this summer — on the strength of help he has received :
from "some comrades’.

"Robert WILLIAMS in Havana hao given STEBONY/1 the impression
that he may visit Algiers as a member of a Cuban delegation.
Aleo, STEBONY/1 understands that William WCRTHY, who has been in
Hanoi, will be going to Algiers. STZBONY/1 expects to meet a
mumbder of his friends there and his main reason for wishing to
make this trip is to discuss his problems, past and present,

with these friends and other interested parties. He hopes to
clear up doubts and uncertainties and, in this context, he has
commented that one of the reasons for much of the hostility shown
to him hae been the reluctance of others to involve themselves

in the differences whioh arose between himself and Jacquea VERGES
Dbeoause the latter was olearly more influential and more important
than STESONY/1.

*sTEBONY/4 hed heard that VERGES was still insisting that
STEBONY/1 wes a KUBARK agent and that Nile ANDERSON and Jacques
GRIPPA were ‘ODYCKE double agents’. GRIPPA, who is leader of the
pro-Chinese Commniet group in Belgium, is planning to bring up-
to-date hie book "Marxism-Leninism or Revisionism’, publisned two
years ago, by adding a new chapter. STEBONY/1 is looking into the
possitility of ite publication in the UK or PBPRIMS and, in this
context, he considers ‘Konthly Review" to be the only possible
medium although Leo HUBERMAN, one of the publication's editors,

is not enthusiastic about the idea.”

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES:

1. During a recent meeting, STEBONY/1 oalled ny attention to the
Ddook Politicel Africa, by honald SEGAL, published London 1961 by Stevens
and Sons, Ltd. STZBONY/1 used tha book to look up a brief bio squib on,
as it happened, Patrick Duncan. He commented that the book, although out
of date and far from objective (one of the collaborators was Rosalynde
AINSLIE), was extrezely useful to his.

2. I subsequently got a copy of the book, and find it useful. Hone~
theless, it is far out of date. It vould appear that there is a great need
for an up-dated version, more comprehensive and sore objective. STEBONY/ 1
Bight be the ideal person to work up such a book (he could even put some of
his wife's talents to work, in such a project), and, in turn, such a
Project could augment nicely his cover for, say, a year.

3. For Headquarters consideration then, the following suggestions
Contact Prasger (who published Political Afriog in the U.S.) or another
appropriate firs, and lay on a commission to cospile such a compendiun of
facts, figures and faces on the African scene. Have them in turn commission
SPEBONY/ 1 to do the job, and provide hia with enough of an advance to ,belp
cover his needs for a period of a year, say, starting after STSBOHY/1's
sumger in Algiers. (Alternatively, of course, STEBOHY/1! could be instructed
-- to coma to Prasger with such a proposal, which we could encourage Praeger
to acoept.) ‘Thies could run concurrently with STEBONY/1's newsletter, if it
materializes, and without any apparent conflict. It could aleo afford him
edditional cover for travel and interviews, as well as funds. And s useful
reference tool could result.

4- This is just a suggestion, but we'd like to know what you think of it.

MEMORANDUM FOR: See Distribution - ;
* FROM "3 GA/CF; CI/Icc
SUBJECT 2 Richard Gibson
1. Areas of Knowledgeability. A reading of the transcription of

Gibson's taped debriefing clearly underlines KATZENBACH's assesament
that Gibson possesses an encyclopedic kmowledge of personalities end
@roups ranging from Zanzibar to the U.S. It is not always clear from
the debriefing to what extent Gibson enjoys either a first-hand imov-
ledge or even a friendly relationship with specific individuals or
groups. what is clear is that Gibson moves in a milieu on which we
presently have very little coverage; that he is already a member of

. this loosely defined society end thus can be presumed capable of de-
veloping new contacts or strengthening old ones by means of present
a:d past associations.

|
j
|
i
|
i
i
‘
{
i
| It is difficult to categorize or devine what this milieu is.
H It is not the world of commmist parties -- although it contains a pre-
j ponderance of communists; snd it does not seen to be a society which
| necessarily revolves about the Chinese. The primary commen denomina-
tor covering most of the personalities involved in Gibson's reporting
is some association with the revolutionary movement in Africa -- parti-
. Cularly Algeria. A secondary means of characterizing these contacts is
i e correlation with the radical French end Delgian left vaieh ites ont
im side such organized party structures as the PSU, PCF, BCP. (His main
' access to Chinese commnists runs through Jacques GRIPFA in Belgium and
| Nils ANUZRSSON in Switzerland with vbom he claims to be on good terms at
- the present time.) Another common thread, almost as general, is asao-
‘ ciation with Trotskyism, although the meaning or clarification of this
political description is never spelled out. In general, Gibson displays
& good and often personal kmowledge of target areas which might be
grouped as follows:
i

ae. African exile revolutionary circles in France, Algeria
end London, including the PAC, ANC, MPLA, MPA, and other less
organized pockets.

be European leftist sympathizers of the Liberation movement
in Africa.

Ce Algerians or Algerian contacts in Burope vho vere asso-
ciated with the war for independence.

a. Algerian personalities currently active or occupying
official positions in Algiers.

2. Access and Limitations on Access. ‘There appareatly has been
circulated @ charge that Gibson is a CIA agent. (This is reflected in
his 201 as dating from his days vith the FPCC.) In dealing vith this
question, however, KATZENBACH cites Gibson's own belief that he is still
able to operate in the circles vhich would be of interest tous. It is,
of course, difficult to tell fron his debriefing the extent and serious-
ness of this charge against Gibson, insofar as it affects his bona fides.
It does seem that in Gibson's milieu, goseip, personal attacks, muddled
loyalties and an aura of conspiratorial confusion are everyday facts of
life and that personal contact and effectiveness in building rapport

‘would far outweigh such critical personal charges -- which, indeed, pro=

Dably circulate about most people. At the present time, for reasons not
entirely clear, Gibson feels that he would be unwelcome and restricted
were he to visit Ghana, and, in fact, would not like to make such a
trip. He has indicated, on the other hand, that he has friends in Al-
geria and believes he could probably get some kind of job there or at

% find a receptive and generally friendly reception. He also appears
*%© bave some contact and standing with the Indonesian government, since
he elaims their London Embassy offered him employment. It is not knowm
to
in

E

vhat extent he might be able to parley such a contact into emloyment
or some form of official association in Europe, although
these questions could be explored further. The termination of his asso-
elation vith Revolution and Verges would not, according to his account of
it, discredit him in the eyes of those who might have been partisans of
the ideological line which this magazine purveyed. According to his
account, Verges is not in good standing with the pro-Chinese like Grippa

" or even the Chinese, and that his (Gibson's) quarrel with Verges over

unpaid salary is well known. While this may not be unbiased, it is
epparently true that he has lodged a claim for payment against Verges,
end thus is not in the position of having been expelled from Revolution
for ideological deviation. As Gibson mecounts it, it is Verges, not he,
who is discredited. :

3. Motivation end Readiness to Cooperate. The debriefing reflects
between the lines vhat KATZENBACH judges in his covering dispatch to be
@ readiness to collect information for us mowing that ve are an official
agency and probably suspecting that we are KUBARK. His professed moti-
vation is monetary, and frankly 90, although a certain degree of fatigue
with his past profession of ideological punditry is discernable. There
are also a number of indications that Gibson would like to rehabilitate
himeif lest he be forced to make his living for an indefinite period of
time in an environment that he finds both unpleasant and materially un-
rewarding. It is not possible, of course, to make an intelligent judge-
went from this debriefing on the firmess and consistency with which he-

wight undertake continuing assiguments for us, but this is not an
wousual area of uncertainty vith a new agent and one which a probe-

. tionary period should dispel. (It should be noted that in one instance,

be volunteered a name as an operational lead -- i.e., as someone whom ve
might find it worthwhile to look up. He also provided vhat is apparently
an accommodation address in Bogota for Chinese mailings.)

kh. Long-Range Usefulness and Initial Targetting. Gibson's long-

renge-usefulness, of course, would depend not only on his effectiveness
and dependability, but on the opportunities which will emerge and take
shape as a result of his initial activity. As a general proposition, he
ean be viewed as an intelligence collection asset targetted at radical
Andependence movements, pro-Chinese personalities and organizations,
end official personalities in newly emerged countries, primarily in
Africa. Specifically, these targets vould include:

@. PAC end ANC: Gibson claims to have friends in both.

b. FIN and Algerian government and publishing circles.

¢. Afro-Asian Journalists Association, and by extension,
other Afro-Asian groups, such as exist or promised in youth,
labor, women, and so forth.

a. Pro-Chinese European parties, including the Belgian (he
claims to have access to Grippa), the Marseilles faction and the
Swiss activity of Nils Andersson.

ee By extension from these, although at present only a
remote possibility, developing Chinese propaganda and intelli-
gence instrumentalities.

In the short range, a current assignment for us should meet the follov-
ing criteria:

_@ lend itself to probationary exploitation;

be not tie Gibson dom indefinitely to one location or
Anvolve him in an identification with one faction, group or
party that would limit his later flexibility;

ce. permit hin to respond to targets of opportunity as we
may define them, both to have a maximm test of the range of his
capability and access, and to probe for the best long-range use
ve can put him to;

a. eanble him to build his bona fides and his contacts as
ve may direct. ‘

The best likely assignment to fulfill these requirements is that of a |
journalist, preferably operating from Europe, capable of credible travel
in Burope, Africa and even Asia, with some associations vhich will pre-
serve his bona fides with target Afro-Asien grou;s. Assuming the devel-
opment of adequate cover, he could then spend an initial period this
spring and surmer in Algeria to cover the Second Bandung Conference

(29 June) and the World Youth Festival (25 July). (Other international
conference, including followp AAPSO meetings to the Ghana Congress in
May, an Afro-Asian Journalists Conference or further PAJU meetings can-
Bot be anticipated as targets at present either because of indefinite.
planning or because of unsuitable location. There is little doubt, hov-
ever, that additional meetings will take place in Algiers end Africa
bringing together interesting target personalities from Africa and Asia
vhom Gibson might attempt to report on.) In addition to his contribu-
tion in coverage of these meetings he might also attempt to develop his
access and contact among the official Algerian commnity at least with
the value of developing biographical and operational support data.

5. Proposed for Discussion. The following questions seem to pre-
sent ves for discussion at this time:

@ decision on the continuation of support to Gibson ona
probationary period;

b. determination on targetting for initial probationary and
possible long-range employment;

aT}

c. mechanics of establishing a project;
a. timetable for assigurents.

publication "Revolution", left London towards the end of January 1965
and returned in the second half of March, having visited Lausanne,
Milan, Rone, Paris and Brussels. During his travels he net Nils
ANDERSSON, who was fornerly connected with "Revolution" in Lausanne
and Jacques GRIPPA, the leader of the pro-Chinese dissident group of
the Belgian Comzunist Party. Since his return to the U.K. he has made
proposals to the Afro-Asian Journalists’ Association for these persons

_ to receive copies of the Association's publication, "Afro-Asian

1. Ref forwarded the tapes and a rough transcription of the debriefing
session with Subject, which were held on February 17, 18, 19, 23, 1965.

2. In accordance with Headquarters’ instructions, these aeetings
were kept on a don! t-cell~us-wo'll~call~you basis ~ in faot GIBSON wae given
no means for calling us. Aleo in accordance with deaiquartera’ instrustions,
we did not pay GIBSON at a constant rate of over $100 per hour. The first
\ ($300) payment to GIASON was in fact more than we had originally intended to
give him as a "binder", but in light of the imminence of his trip to Rurope
w: advanced him that sum to help him to meet his expenses. This nicely
“eoincided with our own time table, since the time he vas gone — some three
weeks — should have provided adequate time for the initial tare to be
reviewed and for requirements to be prapared and pouoked to the field. At
any rate, the total sum given to GIBSON, for his time and e shot at his
mailing list, was $700.

3. LCHARVEST may well feel that it has been done out of $700 in COA

funds. The information obtained on ChiCom contacts of GIBSON, or on any
» ChiCome at all, was slight. GIBSCN claims not to have hed more than very
- little contact with them, and not to know too much about them. Unless there
is hard info to the contrary, we are inclined to believe that GIBSON was
telling pretty much the truth in this respect, as indeed eeems to have been
the oase almost all of the time. While this is a bit of a disappointment,
in a way, and seems to lessen the immediacy of LOYARVHST interest, it
certainly does not appear to eliminate GI3SON's potential worth.

4. ‘The London Station continues to feel that GIBSON has considerebdle
potential as a source of positive intelligence on a wide range of targets ~
targets that appear to be only lightly covered otherwise, although we are
not always able to judge this. A review of this debriefing can only cause
one a certain amount of amazement at GIBSON's encyclopedic knowledge of sany,
many groups, personalities and parties of the far left, literally from
America to Zanzibar. We leave it to Headquarters, of course ao evaluate

hie material; to the London Station, however, it appears to be not only
rather massive but detailed as well. Ye do not doubt that he will de

caught out from tine to time on facts, and yerhaps interpretationa as well.
But tne totality of his information — and the whole performance wae without
notes - is astonishing.

5- Several points should be noted. First of all, a conscious effort
was asde to show GIBSON that his commente on the American scene were not
being made a matter of record. (I took notes during our talk, and always
stopped making notes when such a topic came up.) This ie, as XULPA noted in

_ OFLW «1903 of 12 February 1965, an area of sensitivity with GI3SO¥. The only
times that GIBSON really became emotional were when he talked about the
American scene, his involvement, and the involvezent of hie close associates.
And he kept reverting to the topio, and his involvezent in it, throughout
our oonversations. We did not share ZULPA's impression that GIBSON's
dissatisfaction with the state of racial relations in America makes him
generally anti-American. 'e does say that he would not like to be living
in America for the coming year; but in the oontert of one who does not wish
to be caught up in a period of growing violence, which GIASON appears not to
believe to be the solution to the problem. Fe states: “I can understand
how they feel that way, I can recognize the problems, but I sure don't know
what the eolution to the problem is." His judggents on Kegroee in the front
of the racial struggle (Walter Bowe, Yalcolm X, etc.) refleot not only ar
intimacy with the problem and a gemine concern, but also a generally
reasonable and real understanding of many of the forces at work. GI3S0N
tends to condemn individuals ~- he spares no sympathy for the FBI, under-
standably - but he does not appear to condemn the United States as a whole,
nor even the United States Government as a whole. At the same time, he
makes no phoney protestations, either.

. ty
pa

6. Regarding Cuba, GIBSOX showed a similar emotional involvement (he
acknowledges "sy pro—Castro bias") but, withal, manages to give a more
balances portrayal of the situation than many rabidly anti-Castro
commentators. (Suba, and Cuban matters, were also similarly low-keyed by
me during our talke.)

. Te Where GIBSON really comes into his own, and really astonishes with
the breadth of his personal information and understanding, (and largely, it
appears, without the same personal involvement and bias) is in African
affairs (especially in left-wing fields:, European Trotskyiste and
Cowmuniets and their general milieu, and Chinese~oriented international
front organizations. Similarly he aprears to be informed on certain ChiCon
efforts at subversion and propaganda in Latin America.

8 Rather as if reading our thoughts, GIBSON offered to recruit him
self, He didn't get too specific, and neither did we. But he did make it
quite clear that he would be willing to collect information for us, knowing
only that we were ODYCK=, probably suspecting that we were KUBARK, and
probably equslly doubting (becsuse ze knows the difference( that we wore
ODANVY. Hie motivations can be compiled from his om words. He has for
sore time been unable to find a suitable job here in London, He has economic
pressures working on him — now exacerbated by the fact that his wife has
caused her brother to withdraw some of the support that he Lad been
providing. Venal? Opportunistic? Or someone who has a wife and two kids
to support, and no job for the past eignt mcnths? GIBSON acknowledges that
he has become somewhat bored with the “rbro-biology" of chasing petty
ideological differences, the kind that maxe faotions of six menbers or less.
At the same time, he acknowledges that he has to have a job, and that his ..

‘aocess to and knowledge of these persons and groups arc marketable
commodities. His preference, he says, would be to have a nice quiet
journalistic or public relations jcb here, but his efforta to find such 4
job have been fruitless. How, obvicushy, oan one of his background and
talents better enploy then than as e coliector and reporter oF information?
He says that he would like public relations or yrese work fer the UN, perhaps,
or an ODYCKE agency, but he is certain that he could never cet the requisite
security oleerance. Still, obviously, he suspects that an “irregular” arm
of ODYOKZ, such as we, might be able to work something out.

9. How about hia ideological motivation? We had hoped fer some
more concrete expression than we got, on thie score, but what we have
is not too bad. du states that he will not be "intellectually dishonest":
to the point of becoming a "professicnal anti-Communist," by which he
means a propagandiat. At the same time, he agreeea that he has no
desire to be a profassional revolutionary. Again we note that he is
not blindly or unduly oritical of ODYOKE. Granted, he criticizes many
flements of ODYOXS pelicy and tends to defend some enemies of CDYCXE.

A failure for him to do so would be sufficiently remarkable to make

ue totally suspicious of him. Note further his comment that ne would

hevebean perf. willing +o talk to u year n th
fashion as This would: sound rather suspicious and

difficult to celieve, wore it not for the fact that hs did show hin-

self to be candid and cooperative in hie Paris interview with a FBSWING

officers

19. Yow badly .odlewn is CE3SCN, then, if we are thinking of using
him. After all, he sas been publicly labelled a "OTA agent." Could he,
then, work for HVBARE successfully? GIZ50" himeelf is certainly a better
judge of that than the London Station, and we feel that there are only
two indices that can be used to judge tte matter. The first and most
immediate Js GIESON's own opinion, eince Le has lived with the problem,
and has tested the idea in prectice. He feele that he could still
operate ("nove” is his tern) in most cf the ceeirable arees sucoess—
fully, provided ke hee adequate cover for being where he is ani ‘détag
what he does. The second index would be for us to test hie continuing
access to targets of interest. It should not take too long to make
such a test without putting anything into real jeopardy.

11. Cover for GIBSON, of course, would be a serious problem. Fe
himself proposes the obvicus answers soue kind of vaguely left
journalistic tie-up. We should think that such cover could be arranged.
And ve propose to disucss a number of possibilities with Headquarters .
in due tine.

12. Utilization and lccale are most closely related, of course.
Fro’ our vantage point here, it would appear that Algiers would be tne
most desirable home base for GIBSCN. Fe could range out from there into
furore or the rest of Africa (tia two best targets, apparently) and
maintain a reguler flow of information on Algerian affairs while “at
home." He has spoxen several times of the ease with which ke is integrated
into the Algerians environment, and he bas a fairly well established base
there from which to expand his operations. He has said that he would be
willing to go there, or France, or most any other place where his
children can continue their education in French. And Algiers appears
to be, for the foreseeable future, a worthwhile target in its own right,
as well as the site of a growing number/of internationel front organisation
meetings, for which GIBSON would appear to have exceptionally fine
credentials. As he says, he could go elsewhere in Africa, but Algiers
fie where he would fit best. We would be inclined to keep him, for the
cost part, away from the Cuban milieu (except, perhaps, incidentally) *°
avoid straining hie reportorial objectivity. Jn the African, Furopean,
and international front areas, we suspeot that careful checking would
ensure such objectivity.

‘43. His utilization could best be considered on a straight
information-collecting basis. To use him as a propaganda tool would be
not only repugnant to him but destructive of his utility as well.
Presumably he Gould be permitted to continue to write, not only for
hie overt enpPyere ‘in a straight news fashion), but perhaps cocasionally
for leftist periccicils of his ow choosing, in order to maintain his
om cover. (This is, admittedly, seeing rather far into the future.)

We do feel, however, that GIBSCN could be an admirable and highly valuable
collector of positive information on that whole spectrum of the left with

which he ie already so familiar.

14. GIBSCN and security, to this roints OGT3SON has met only
myself, under alias, and under the impression that I was here temporarily.
Thie idea was apparently made to etick, throughout our conversations.

We would propoee thet, if GIBSCN te recruited in fact, he be handied in
alias and at a good, safe distance — more than arm's length. Until
aufficient operational testing had been carried-out, we would suggest

that he not have a “resident case officer" anywhere - i.e., neither

here nor in Algiers. Control of GIBSON is partly exeroieed by the

documents we have received from him (receipts, meno of understanding)

plus the voluminous taped comments. These, while not worthy of e court,

are sufficient to do him considercble professtonal and personal damage —
note particularly that his wife, according to him, would not approve of

any of our contacts, and this appears to be quite meaningful to hin.
Financial control would be a continuing factor. And, perhaps to an
unusually high degree, we feel that GIBSON would feel considerable

gratitude to whoever (i.e., KUBARK) rescued him from his present and
difficult porition, “forgiving all", and providing him with a measure of
respectability (at least in his own eyes) that he has henceforth been, ..\.-~
unable to achieve and saintain. In sum, we feel that a reasonably ‘“" °
strong conbination of control factors exist, and oan be continued for

as long as GIBSON would be properly handled.

TOTS ee ee cee me

‘ 15. We should also like to comment on the reliability of GIBSCN's
comments in the course of our meetings to date. We have found hin to

+ be thoroughly consistent in his commente and attitudes throughout.

en We found no indication of deliberate deception or sericue attempts to

“mislead. He may heve provided some erroneous materials, or he ray have

térroneously interpreted some evente; tut his comments and attitudes

rémained sufficiently consistent to lead us to believe that he vas

being reasonably honest all the way. He played dow soze items, no

doubt, and played up others. In the course of a debriefing such as this

was there seemed little or no point in pushing hard at such points —-

tesides, his knowledge of the areas covered so far outdistanced aine

that I could not kave attenpted to probe or pin him down on specifics.

(Note also kis tendenoy to make corrections in the debriefing questionnaire,

as when the: wrong name would appoar for a political group in Sqitzerland. )

16. GIBSON's present status is that he is out of work, in debt, and
without any prospects of reasonable employment in the near future. He
is somewhat occupied with an article he is writing for Fnoounters this
will probably keep him from taking another job for the next few weeks.
Beyond that, nothing is definite. If we would like to give him a try,
then, some move should be made to formalize matters with him before he
accepts some job that will put him out of the market.

17. Recognizing that there are risks involved, 1% nevertheless seens

most undesirable to pases up what has the earmarks of being a highly
useful asset. We request, therefore, that Headquarters review and consider
the entirety of our knowledge of GIBSON to this point, and give us a .
reading on his potential worth, aa viewed by LOEARVEST, AF Divieion,
KUDZSK/ICG and other interested parties. If, fc: reasons of which
Feadquarters is aware, and we are not, GIBSON is considere2 unacceptable
as a KUTUBE asset, let ua know. Iz, on the other hand, there appears to
be a market for his talents and capabilities, ‘we should sove rather
rapidly to pre-empt him. His present flexibility is not likely to last
for long, and any plan to use hin should také this into account. As

BC ig aware, we are not in a position to mt this into the form of a
London Station project. This should not be the reason for negleoting .
what appears to be such a potentially rewarding asset for KUBARK, however.

18. We would appreciate a reply within a couple of weeksof Head~

quarters’ receipt of this dispatch.

varies: the first session is mostly summarized, the subsequent ones are
almost verbatia. Roberta 4. HORRELL did the transoripte, ani I
subsequently reviewed thea, filling in comments, names, etce, that HORRELL

had missed.

2. As rough as these transcripts are, a careful review of then

disoussed. Further comment from this end will be contained in an
operational dispatch. Right now we are anrious to get the present material
into Headquarters’ hands for further processing. Thies is about aa far as
we oan take the material here, due to extreze time limitations. We are
retaining s copy of the transcript, however, for further use and future

reference.

There was a letter to Anderson from Chalion,who remained with the
Algerians. There was an attempted phone eall from them down there- probably
Chalion or someone with the magazine- which Andersson refused to accept.

So we really were never before the choice. In other words, he proposed

the summer of 63. At the time of the break with Algiers, she was working

as our correspondent here?! (she) was extrenely upset. She was holding

£1000 of Verges' money. She didn't know which way to go. Harbi came here
and talked to her. She whole thing fell through. Finally she chose the ,

him through Presence Africaine. He snppesedix was writing a book about Cuba
He was very much involved with Kobert Williams,with Malcolm X, he is
extremely young but very active in kady -——— - He is of Jamaican
origin. There is a Jamaican minortty in eastern Cuba, in Camaguey and
Oriente Province. That's how you get names like Moore, etc. His father and
brother live in New York, his motheris still in Cuba. He went back to Cuba
after the Bay of Pigs, and went to school there. He became very disillusioned. |
He left, claiming that there was racial discrimination and so forth in Cuba.

violently counter-revolutionary. He claims there is no revolution,

His position, is relatively aitarre. « It's not terribly justified.

But what I think is, that here is a case of Black Nationalism in the States
being transported to Cuba. What he claims is that the only Cuban revolution
that remains to be made that would be valid would be a black revolution.

and that reallfy the population of Cuba is overwhelmingly black,or of African
descent, and that this has been a plot that has gone on for generations

even now #ith Fidel Castro, particularly Dorticos, he claims, the white
leadership has been able to perpetuate itself regardless of the political
thing. This is his theme. He is interesting but extremely wild and emotional.

_I think it’s a case where the intoxication of Harlem never went off. Anyway
/ he might be worth talking to.

The Congress for Cultural Freedom people were going to try to get is
touch with him but they weren't any too convinced that his thesis was
correct. I don’t think s0. He claims of course that I am completely blinded
by ‘ny pro-Castro synpathies.He claimed that Williams was very unhappy for
racial reasons in Cuba. I thought that Williams was simply unhappy, Ne

couldra’t speak Spanish. He was under pressurex from the American Conmunists
and Soveit Communists that didn't like him, the old Cuban Communists,
which was one of the reasons for his wholeshearted tura towards Peking.

That was the oaly way out... And he wanted to come back to:.the States. _

There is an outfit called the Philippine Review which I think we (Revolution)
gave publicity to- here it is- - the Progressive Review. Jt is connected
with Pomeroy. They are about as Communist as they can get under the present
xuH a
law of the Philippines.They have hopes of what they call tha Anti-Iuperialist
ground swell, in other words, an anti-American trend im the present govera-
went. They felt that the anti-Malaysia campaign might help, and the editor
has been very much in contact with the Indonesians. He has been to Djakarta
on several occasions recently. He is in contact with Pomeroy. Pomeroy’s
of what he says
position is one inwhich he has to be very carefuls because the British
Communists will dump him. His wife is Philippine.She can't get an American

visa, so they have to live here. This makes him the captive of a certain

part of the British Labor Left and the British CP. His book, The Forest,

¥. Tranemitted herewith is one copy of the cards that
constitute the nailing liet for Revolution. These were borrowed
frow Richard GIBSON and copied in the station. GIBSOK's wife, -.
who compiled the carde and was responsible for distribution of
Revolution (and to whom, therefore, they more properly belong)
ie not avare that GIBSON has “loaned” the cards out. They

were returned to GIBSON's flat the same day he brought ther in

for copying.
2. We have not made any attempt to count then. There are

several thousand. A few comments will be in order about some of
the marke and notations that appear on the cards.

3. One general cate;-ory is “Promotional”, The first
bunoh of sheets — about twenty, it appears ~ are in this category.
They are marked "Promotional" or "FR". These were sent out gratis
either to induce publicity, or to encourage new subscribers, or
to make friende happy. (Presumably, Robert WILLIANS and several
others are in this category).

4. Thereafter, the cards run in categories of one sort
or another, with given countries generally lumped together. Those
where the address was obviously stapled onto a oard sre some of
those that were taken from Frene GINWALA's Spearhead mailing list.
Some are marked “ex-Spearhead"; which means that the name came froa
the Spearhead list, and the person subsequently subscribed on hie
om, after a little promotional treatment.

5. The coded syabols, unfortunately, GIBSON could not
explain, since this was his wife's territory, rather than his owne
The firet set of letters obviously refers to the country (e.g, UK/)e
Other numbers and lettere are not clear. The name that appears
apart from the name of the subscriber usually indicatee who arranged
the subscription (thie may be an agent, or something like a gift
subseription). For instance, 8. ¥. LES is Sheldon LEE, who handles

sone subsoriptions. Expiration dates are obvious. "“Private*
Berely means that someone ordered a subsoription directly,
higself, rather than through an agenoy.

6. Any further questions relating to the list oan be
ineluded in any subsequent contacts with GTBSON- jf thay merit
inclusion, and if it seems likely that will know tho answers.

J. We note that the list’s accuracy cannot be guaranteed,
. @specially after the tine when the GIBSON's parted ways with

1. On 11 February KUBARK Staff Agent Errol 8. KULPA, who had
contact with GIBSON in 1363-64, listened to reference tape and made
the following comments, which may be helpful to Katzenbach. KULPA
felt that the GIBSON that he was hearing on the tape had indeed
changed rather radically since the last time KULPA had any contact
with him or the Revolution. KULPA remembers GIBSON as anti-white
and probably (because of this racial orientation) anti-U.S. KULPA
is therefore quite suspicious of GIBSON's motivations and advises
that extreme precaution be taken in the handling of GIBSON.

2. KULPA's view of Gibson's motivations:

KULPA has strenuous doubts as to any idealogical motivation
on the part of GIBSON, He recognizes the obvious monetary
motivation and feels that this probably plays a large part
in the man's being willing to talk to ODYOKE, Another very
possible motivation is GIBSON's disaffection with VERGES,
Parenthetically, KULPA added that in Algiers and probably in
Paris, GIBSON was really nothing more than a name that VERGES
wanted on the masthead. GIBSON's primary duties as "editor"
were probably in the area of translation. In light of this
KULPA feels that perhaps some legitimate information of value
can be obtained in the area of the Revolution. Again, paren-
thetically, it might be noted that KULPA felt that G1B80N
was not as "idedistic" as his wife, Where GIBSON might adhere
to the aspects of Marxism-Leninism that called for revolutionary
change (probably because of his dissatisfaction with a world
in which the black man had to endure a certain amount of
discrimination), he is not a strict doctrinaire in any of
his beliefs. On the other hand, KULPA pointed out that
GIBSON's wife (who by the way is a Central European by birth--
not British) is idealistic in the sense that she feels her
brand of leftism must be internally and idealogically
consistent. (This is why she objected to GIBSON's writing
for Encounter and why she probably would get upset if she
knew exactly what type of game her husband was currently
playing with ODYOKE.)

Subject. Together with the requirements is a KUDESK narrative on -
VERGES-ANDERSSON-ERevolution complex for the background information
of Katzenbach. Further background on Revolution can be found, if
you have not already done so, in the following dispatches:

| 2. We have not yet had time to review the tape of your first
| session with Subject forwarded with Reference, nor do we expect to
i get a transcription completed in time to reach you by 15 February.
The list of names attached to Reference indicate considerable know-
| ledgeability on the part of Subject as well a tendency to pour out
his knowledge in a sort of stream of consciousness style. We fear
that, if given the opportunity, Subject will take the bit in his
~ teeth and as much money as he can in his hot little hands and be
i ’ off and running. To prevent this we would like to suggest that the
i debriefing be set up on a tightly organized, businesslike basis.
would probably be advisable to write up the terms in a Letter of
Agreement contract for Subject's signature before getting started,
- waking sure to include a paragraph in which ODYOKE's obligations
: and promises are limited to the terms specifically enumerated in the
i document, We think that any meaningful debriefing will take 3 - 5
i days, and there is good reason to believe that Subject will have
* information of sufficient interest to justify this expenditure of
i Case Officer time. We do not foresee any long range operational
H relationship with Subject. While we look at the debriefing as
. basically a cne-shot proposition there will probably be follow-up
questions and, perhaps, specific action requests, requiring a later
contact. Therefore, the communication ‘channel to Subject should be
left open on a "don't call us, we'll call you” basis.

3. In line with the need to put the debriefing on a businesslike
(rather than a "flexible") basis, it might be a good idea to start
by getting Subject to supply a personal history statement from the
time of his first entry into leftist political movements to the
present day. (This can be presented to Subject as a basis for us
te formulate meaningful questions, not as any sort of personal
"confession" on his part.) In addition to providing us with a
check on his veracity, this will set the stage for a debriefing
conducted on KUBARK's terms, not Subject's. It is important that
it be made clear to Subject at the outset that we want facts, not
speculation, commeratary and analysis. —

4. Please charge payments to Subject for the debriefing to
Acct. Hr. 5137 - 1468 (Hqs. LCHARVEST OOA). Three hundred dollars
for the initial 24 hours talk with Subject is on the steep side.
Wewere thinking in terms of $700 for five days debriefing with a
bonus for a copy of the Revolution mailing list.

Wile ANDERSSCT, Swedisn-born resident of Switzerland, heads a
printing and peblishing establishment ("Editions la Cite*$ in Lavsonne,
said to havea been set up in 1957 for the printing ani distributing of
Chinese literatcre, (This ties in with other infernstion thet the firm

i was established in Switzerland during the Algerian war ia erder to
publish printed natter banned in France.) Siace 1°63 the fir= had been

| responsible for the English-language edition of Per-ivticn, bet in 1964

: the printing of the English-language edition was traneferred to Paris

I . where Eevoivtion's main cffice is located. Swiss authorities had ordered

I - ANDERSSON to cease publication of Revolution.

Revojction has had e conplicated history, It_is descended from
_ African Hevolution which first appeared in early 1963)}in Algeria, Ite
‘BATVEF, Jacques VERGES, is a former ne=ber of the French CP who broke
with that party cver the Algerian qvesticn, After VERGES, who briefly
headed African Pavolution, had a falling ont with Algerian officials
later in'\1°63,and left that country, he began a new peblication in
Switzerland-using the facilities of the already established AYSIRSSCK
fire, His new publication was called tevolvtion, scmstines imova as
Revolution — ‘sie, latin Anarica, Africa, (The Algerians costinve to
| peblish Afetoen Ferolvtion, which has no known connection vith Sevolution.)
* Initially both the English and French editions of Revolution were haz=died
by ANDERSSON's firm, but the oublishing operations of tus French edition
vere very soon moved to Paris, Later the trinting, too, of the French
edition was moved to Paris and only the English edition continued to be
printed in Switserland, YERGSS and the main offices vare located in Paris.*

Currently ANDERSSON is reported to publish (ct-bra, which is
described as the organ of an organization in Switzerland called the
. "Centre Lenine," oth Cotcbre and the Centre Lenine are eaid to ba con
> trolled by AYDIPSSON, but wery little information is available about either,
The Centre hes teen described as 4 preparanda arn of the Chinese Communists.
There is soce indicaticn that they also have sans comection with pro-
Chinese dissident elerents of the Spenish CP,

AMDERSSOS's firm has also printed Mundo Obrerp Pevoluctomrio (MOR),

G

* Although the Mngiish edition wes crinted in Svitserland, its editorial
office was aleo in Paris, headed by Richard GiSSCY, ‘zerican negro. In
Jate Yay and early June 1%4 -— vhen it was already apparent that Suies
authorities were going to close down the rrinting of Revolution in that
“eountry — GIUSCN and Alexandre STRILNCYF went to The Netherlands seeking

the alantestine prblication of a mafor rro-Chinese Spanish Comeuntet

reports that the MCE group may rerge with one or more of the other
@issident Soantsh Cocunist grours and that a joint organ will be
published, MOR rey eoon cease (or may acready have ceased) prblicatica,
What role ANDZPSSGf may play in new publication efforts of the crow
Chinsse Spenish dissidents is not known,

The clandestine leadership of the Partido Comunieta Revolucionarie
has ‘been located in Lausanne, Svitzerland, with sone representation also
in Faris, but this group has apparently been receiving Chinese finuncdal
sesistance through the GRIPPA party in Belgic=., Another rro-Cninese
Spanish group in Svitserland, the Cposicion Revoluciczario Camunista

; located in Geneva, has been publishing la Chiena, The Chista group

hae reportedly been raceivirg funds froz the Chinese Enbessy in Pern,
Stil) encther vro—Chinese Spanish group, the Agzrupacton Comunista
Proletario, hes been publishing Proletario, anparently from Paris bet
with some representation also reported in Yelgitm, While the grour
kas apparently hed sone contact with GRIFFA in Yelgiuz, the Paris—tased

at one tire at least appe-red to be sponsored er aided by YERGES,
CRIFPA has played an active role in trying to bring the different
{er dissident groups to a xerger,)

The relationstip between CRIPPA and AYDERSSON, GRIPFA and VERGES,
and VERGES and ANDERSSON is anything but clear, Same part of the
confusion may result from GRIFPA's driving efforts to function as the
Girector of Chinsse political operations in “urope, and to try to bring
the activities of others under his control.

a. GRIPPA vas once renorted to have said he had "lost
confidence" in Revolution. Atong his reported reasens was &
Ddelief that VEXGES warted to be désignated absolute leader in
Europe for the "revolutionary novenent." Somevhat later GRIPFA
was reverted cs saying thst the Chinese were no lenger subsidizing
Revolution and that it was now being becked by Feris editor

- Francois MASFERO,

db. GRIFFA or his aides also appear to have been responsible
for stories circrlating among sone pro-Chinese “uropean dissidents
that ANDERSS(® had been uritten off by the Chinese as a “Trotexyite.*
GRIFPA has also been quoted as saying that the printing of MCR
would be transferred from Lavsanne to Selgium and to GRIFPA's cv
Poblishing fecility. (This 4s not know to have taken plar:.)

1. Transzitted herewith are copies of JAGUAR’s latest report on Richard
Thomas GIBSON, which thay compiled for us on being informed of our current
operational interest in hin. We expect that further information will be
forthcoming since, as previously noted, they have instituted additional
coverage of GISSON*s activities.

2. JAGUAR refer us to their previous reporting on GIBSON, which has t
been contained in their resorts on Revolution. These include OsL~36, 105(29 :
August 1563); CELA-40,542(15 April 1964); CBLA-~41,545(10 September 1964)5 ‘
OEL~-39,251(24 Septenber 1964), CELA~4:,753(20 Cotober 1964). ;

3. JAGUAR also point out that the paper contains information received
from a nunber of secret sources, and they request that we not give it any
diatribution beyond KUBARK without consulting them, unless, of course, we :
have the inforsation from other sources. JAGUAR have made a copy available | i
to ODENVY Londen. ‘

4. JAGUAR also inforced us orally that the persons they suspect to have
played a most prominent role in the 1963 charges of GIBSOS's CIA affiliation ~
the two persons referred to in para 3 of their paper — were Rosalynd AINSLIE
and Patricia XcGOWAN. JAGUAR gave us thia information informally and off the
records It is interesting to note that, in Ref, GIBSON agreed that AIESLIB
vas. one but msde no mention of MoGOWAN.

5. GIBSC¥ spoke of the affair of JAGUAR"s para 3 (a) at some length,
giving a rather different intorpretation, however. Paras 3 (b), {c), and (a)
are rather nore speculative. ;

6. JAGUAR also told us, informally, that eome of their information on
GIBSON, as contained herein, derives froa sone of his correspondence. fhe
implication is not that JAGUAR has been reading GISSON's cail, but that, by
intercepts or penetrations, they have been reading the mail of sone of the

; ; Richard Thomas GIBSON
Born: Les Angeles on 13.5231
. . Adsress: 30, Stockleigh Hall,
: : _Prince Albert Road, London, NeW Be

GIBSON has been cornected with the pro~Chinese Communist publication
"Revolution" and its prececessor, "African Revolution", at least since
April, 1963. He made evailable the following information sbout himself as
pert of a publicity campaign planned for "Africen Revolution” in the first

i ~ half of 1963:= ;
: 1951-52: _ worked in Rone for the Mediterranean News
: ; . Bureau of the "Christian Science Monitor";
wo 1955-58: editor with the English language service of
: . “Agence France Presse" in Paris;
t 19583 arrested by the French authorities because of
; his work for the Algerian National Liberation
Front;
, 1959-60: returned to the U.S.A. and employed by the

C.B.S. News in New York until dismissed because
of his pro~Quban ectivities;

awarded a C.B.S. fellowship in African Studies
at Columbia University;

“f 1960~Septexber, 1962: Executive Secretary of the "Fair Play for CGuba*
Committee in the U.S.A. —

2. In 1963, GIBSON lived in Lausanne, where "African Revolution" and
subsequently the English edition of "Revolution" were printed, but he paid
frequent visits to "Revolution's” Paris office until the end of the year

when “Revolution” was banned in Switzerland and he was refused permission to
continue to live there. He then settled in Paris where, according to one

. report, he and his wife lived in "quite a luzurious flat’. It would, however,
i be wrong to infer froz this that GIBSON's means enabled him to enjoy high

aa living standards, as another source subsequently reported that he hed not
pada any rent for the flat from Nay to October, 1964.

3. As fer back es August, 1963, there were rusours in Communist circles in
~ london that GIBSON was en Azerican agent and that he hed provided United
ed States

States Intelligence with the names of certain unidentified Unit

negroes in accordance with a brief received from the Americans. Information
from e well-placed source suggests that these rumours may have originated
from the jealous reactions of two persons, connected with "Revolution", whose
aspirations with the publication were cut short when GIBSON becane Editor

of the English edition. However, »y mid~1964, VERGES, ti Editorial Director
of "Revolut‘on", was claizing that complaints about GIBS...'s activities had
been received not only frou Iéndon, but also from Cubs, American negroes in
Mew York and a relative of GIESON's who wes working for the magazine "Spark"

(a) denouncing, in 1958, an unidentified negro, possibly a
Communist, who was expelled from France;

(>). informing the publication's contacts in China that
. "Revolution" was disintegrating;

(0) providing “Newsweek and the "New York Herald Tribune”
with information in an attenpt to discredit "Revolution";

(a) connections with the C.I.A.

Although GIBSON has denied the charges made against hin, he realises that
they have stuck and that it will be scme years before he will be acceptable

to any left wing organisation.

& Having failed to find exployzent in Paris efter leaving "Revolution"
in July, 1964, GIBSON went to the United Kingdom on 7th October and was
joined later by his British wife, Joy Marjorie, and his two children. He
hoped to find work in London, but at the end of November, he was still
without a job and dependent on his wife's family, who were paying the rent
of his flat at 30, Stockleigh Hell, Prince Albert Road, London, N.W.8 It
is now knom whether GIBSON has been able to find employnent.

5. Nothing is known at present about GIBSON's contacts in the United
Kingdom. Although during the tine he worked for “Revolution™ he was in

“touch with mesbers of the pro~Chinese Connunist splinter group in the

United Kingdom ~ the Comzittee to Defeat Revisionism, for Comzunist Unity -
4t 4s not known whether he has resumed contact. It as been reported thet
he still keeps in touch with the coloured South African journalist, Lionel
NORRISON, who is employed by the Chinese~backed Afro-Asian Journalists’

Association (A.A.JeAe) in Djakartas

, Comment; "“Afro~-Asian Journalist", no. 4, dated

"Revolution" and "Spark".

EVYCLUTION
of Interview with Richapd

LOND 5706, 21 January 1965

1. Attached is the tape of the interview with OIBSON, recorded in an
Enbassy office, using a Uher 4000 Report - 5 recorder, recording at a epoed
of 15/16 feet: por ‘minute. “The interviewer used the alias of Earl Wilson.

Gibson arrived at 1745 and departed at about 2030.

2. We are not attempting to summarise or analyze GIBSOS's comments in
this dispatch. The tape provides a much nore revealing picture than our
subjective comments could. A farnotes, however, appear to be in order.

3. Speaking of his departure, CIBSON said he planned to leave London
on 24 or 25 January. As of noon 24 January, at least, he was still in London
because I saw him walking on St. John's Wood High Street. (A potential
problem exists heres GIBSON and I live within a few blocks of one another
and not infrequently ride the same bus line. This problem oan only be mot
when it manifests itself.) JAGUAR, incidentally, has alerted ite immigration
contacts (prior to our meeting with GIBSCN) and requested that his name be
put on a watch list. They said that they would inform us if they learn that
he hag left the country. We have not yet heard that he has left.)

4- GIBSON was given money amounting to $300. Under the circumstances
of, his plans, as he expressed them, it seemed reasonable to do so, to ensure,
at least partially, that he would come tack to talk more. He was more than
willing to take the money. and raised the initial suggestion of $200 to $300
or $400. His obvious shift in his line regarding dollars (as opposed to
pounds) ie further indicative of his willingness to got what he could.

*
I

5 The considerable number of names mentioned by GIBSON makes the
transcription of the notes a sizable chore, and in order to lessen this
Wurden a listing has been compiled of almost all of the names, in the order
in which they appear in the tape, with the exception of VERGES and the Free
Play for Cuba Committee, CBS and a few others. ‘The names appear only one
time each on the list, although many of thes crop up repeatedly in the tape.

& fow of the phrases that do not appear too clearly on the tape are included

o)s

6. GIBSON's offer of a photograph of VERGZS was not accepted, on the
assumption that KUBARK already has a photo. If this is not the case, let |
us know, and we will inolude that in our requirements for a subsequent meeting.

%

7. The AfromAsian Journalists Association man is apperently Lionel
: MORRISCH. He is also referred to as the "man from Djakarta". _ Gee LOND 5575
: of 12 January 1965.)

: 8 The reference tc the Cultural Attache of the Cuban Exbessy corroborates
é {eathers is corroborated by) the material referred to in para 4 of LOND 5337
(22 Decemder 1965). We are not fully aware of the Cuban's politioal orientation
however,

Se In reviewing the: tape, it will become apparent that the arrangenents
with GIBSON were left fairly flexible for the future. It would appear, from
hie responses, that a longer range relationship with him could, in faot, be
established if, after thorough review of his materials, that seems necessary
or desirable.

10. We will oxpect, in addition to the requirements that have been
promised, that Headquarters will advise us on their desire to arrange for the
one~shot approach previously suggested by Headquarters, or a different am
rangement. We are unable to assess the validity or worth of all the comments
he made. Our impression, however, is that he is reasonably Imowledgeable of

, & number of fields of interest to use We also suspect that in some areas his

- knowledge is quite superficial. His gccess to various areas of potential
interest may te partially proved by his trip around Europe and should be a
useful indtoation of how we may be interested in playing him. The possibility
of his being a provocation has not been overlooked, of course, and we weloone
Headquarters’® comments on this soore as well.

ff. We would also appreciate further comments on various personalities,
with whom we are not familiar — "Anderson" is the most obvious in this category.

12. Headquarters is requested to provide us with a transcription of this
tape, 29 well ae the promised requirements, pricr to 15 February. ODENVY
should also be provided with as much of the material as is of interest to then,

-, and a copy of that material should be given to us to pass to the ODENVY office

here. We are also obliged to pass to JAGUAR such elements of this material as

' 4s of legitimate concern to them. In this case, we would suggest that this be .
interpreted rather liberally and Headquarterse~prepared copy be forwarded along
with the other items listed above. (Note that JAGUAR has been quite cooperative
while we have been approaching this case, and their recent rum—down on GIBSON is
being pouched almost simultaneously with this dispatch.)

REF: DIR 78506

As stated in reference we forward herewith copy of Gibson's
letter which the Station might consider using ultimately tc
establish bona fides if other means of establishing bona fides
(such as phone call to Embassy) does not satisfy Gibson. London
case officer in showing the ktter to Gibson need not admit to or
represent himself as a member of KUBARK, though Gibson might well

make that assumption.

REFERENCE: PARI 8052

NOTS: Tne follosing round-up and commentary on Iden A had been drafted
before PAL? 3017 of 6 January 1965 and later traffic preseated the
ease in a soceshat differeat light. ile forvard the following anyway,
as some of the background and sugzestions still secc pertinent.
Several questions raised below have now been resolved, notably the alles-
ation of an Iden A/:UBARK link (explained by the ODEIVY letter of 1
Decewber 1964, not available wnen the following was written). Cories
of recent PALP correspondence oa Iden A, passed to us on 13 January
1965, are attacned as Attaciment 3, USC.

1. Upon receiving the memorancum cited in tne reference, we requested
Zarthner details from U.00UD, stressing our interest in the report that CPUSA
nembers had given IDI C documeats waich suowed LCi A belonged to "the services
of RUBARX". D/5986 of 30 December 1964, UN3OUND's answer to our query, merely
reiterates that the UNBOUND source, 2 good one, sed tie report on a "coumumi-
cation of documents" by Anerican Communists to ID. C, which supposedly
established that IDEN A belonged to KUBARK; UNBOUND states that the source is
not in a position to identify the persons in question. UNBOUWUD's reply suggests
the information night have come from an audio operation; we aight mention here
that IDE: A nas appeared occasionally on UsPAY, but never in an informative
way. A mail intercept mignt also be the source of UNBOUMD's report, or it
may have cowe from a third service (conceivably JAGUAR or S:i0TU).

2. Our continuing preoccupation wth the IDEi A question is three-fold:
(a) his expulsion from IDiii 8 (and taus from acceptance by pro-Peiping groups)
opens the door for ais possible recruitment; (b) we would like to determine
whether bis ouster was engineered by person2l enemies or whether he actually
did work for an intelligence service, and waich one; (c) as Peiping regards
the USA as its primary target, the Cainese can be expected to continue prop—
aganda attacks designed to create Ide D tension and inflame the Afro/Asians

against the U.S.A. Snile domestic effects of such propaganda are properiy
nandled by ODL.VY, the manipulation of Iuii Ys to furtuer Cuinese propaganda
abroad becomes AUsAR\"s concera.

3. “UBARK's recruitcent of IDB: A, or establisiuwent of controlled access
to aim, could be extrevely useiul in coucterin, atcenpts to undermine tue USA
weiie Cie ffaeensiu. LL A piscttauly StLll as < reascuetl, up-iv-date idea
of IDEX 3 plans in this regard, and ie cust snow cue aanes and locations of
many persons involved. Tii2 most efiective approacii to Luni A would prosaply
be througu an offer of money (iis aistory indicates venality, and at preseat be
appears to be in financial difficulties), aad oy stressing his chance to set
even with Wil. Tue purity of IDE A's Coumunism is open to yuestioa and
shoul: not impede recruitment; a aore torniuaole obstacle to a successful
operation is nis possible connection with a foreign intelligence service.

This could be a western service out migut also be the Soviets, for wnow ue.
would serve the dual purpose of causing trouble ior the USA and at tae save
time reporting on the Cuinese propaganda cacuine; it is a matter of record

that toe Soviets view Di: 3 seriously. “uatever tie vasis for a idARn
approaca to Di A, it would require careful security planning, taxing
cognizance of iis instability and his known attitude toeard GUYUKE as an Ide D.

4 “Revolution” nas featured articles by taree Arerican Negroes, Richard
GIBSOi, Robert Franklyn WILLIAMS, and Halcoln X, all ooviously inteaded to
prejudice readers against tne USA on ground of racial injustice. all three
Men are or have been involved with foreiga Communists: GIzSC.i and WILLIAMS
with the Chinese and tie Cudans, notavly, and Malcolm & with tue Cainese and
various African Communists (actual or crypto). ‘ie “iiew York nerald Tribune”
of 4 January 1965 reported Lalcolm's statezent that he aopes to “internationalize”
the American Negro problem, and that he claims to have influenced severai
African governments to make representatious in the U.ti. against tue USA's
treatzent of its Negroes. inis may oe a ioretaste of Cainese plans for foreign
exploitation of this issue; alcola was interviewed by “Revolution” in Cairo,
which bas since proved its enthusiastic aati~Ancricanisa.

. 5. OFP-14693 reports that Philip BART, a pro-Soviet official of the CPUSA,
stted in Decexber 1964 that the CPUSA aas positive proof that four sexbers of
their Chinese faction are being paid by tae Ciinese Coummists. (It is pernaps
relevant tomwte here that the adveat of “Revolution” was nailed by letters to
the iditor from American leftists, including the FPCC; according to UFPa-37875,
Vincent T. LEE of "All Worlds Publications" in iiew York City takes subscriptions
for™Revolution"). It is nard to say where Iii A enters into the clouded
picture of American Communist partisanship in the Sino/Soviet rift, but in
view of his saifting aliegiances he may aave divulged to pro-Soviet CPUSa_
meabers, or to the Soviets themselves, information oa Cainese subversion in
the USA. Tae October 1964 issue of “.iamer & Steel Newsletter" is cited oy
the Radio Free Europe research bulletin of liovember 1964 in tue latter's review
of pro-Cnhinese factions among Western Commmist Parties; 3°£ researca describes
"Hammer & Steel" as a monthly produced in Boston by a small Acerican faction.
(@ortions of the RFE research bulletin wit its citations from “Hammer & Steel”
are attached as Attacament 1). The marked paragraph from "Hamer & Steel” aits
at the idea of wnite nations’ inherent superiority; this is consistent wita
China's claim of a bond among tne colored peoples of tie world, which persits
such effective anti-Soviet propaganda as the wver of "Revolution" for iiay 1964,
which shows KHRUSICHEV saying, "se, the whites...".
6. IDEN C*s denunciation of IDEN A may have been at least partially
? Nj caused by suspicion ne was trying to gain control of IDEi E; 1t will be
we} recalled tiat very shortly oefore bis ouster, IDZi A was in Holland negotiating
ve | for taat type of printing equipzent (AGU 6137 and O:HA 23818). He is now
c living in London; ie nas presumably veen obliged to find vork there (unless
4 he actualiy is on an intelligence payroli), and ie may nave landed with some
leftist publishing outfit or even witha the CPU, which is sufficiently divided
to afford room for his current views, wuatever they may be. In addition to
IDEX A's potential for reporting on Cuinese propaganda efforts, his uses as a
penetration of Britisa or other European Cocmunist publishing circles are ovvious

7. UNBOUND reported that American Cozmunists had allesedly given
IDEN C documents snowing IDi:i A worked for Wasi. One explanation of tais
allegation may lie in 1Dbx A's visit to tue American Eubassy, Paris, in late
1963, at the request of tir. Jolin G, GOSSUIT, tuen Acting Consul General.
GOSSETT was interested in any information ne might nave on possible connections
between IDEN F, with waici IDEN A nad been connected, and President xennecy’s
assassination. (a copy of GOSSETT's Necorandum of Conversation is attached
under separate cover as Attacaaent 2; nis appraisals of Luci A and nis
reservations concerning his motives are interesting). IDEN A and GOSSETT

bad a far-ranging talk, including wnat nay have veen a tentative feeler by
IDEN A for ODYONE exployment. It seems likely that IDL! 4 would aave teperted
an American ¥obassy inquiry to ais friends in Ibis F, and he may even nave
mentioned tlie possidility of future "work" for OVYOxE, waich could have led
to eventual allegations that he nad been recruited by KUZARK. This is of
course speculation, but IDEN A's flexiole loyalties aad liking for money are
surely known to ais colleagues, and, ié he had already aroused antagonism
among them, tie iubassy visit would serve as a peg for sincere or expedient

denunciation.

8. We can saed no light on tae allegation that IDEN G is a KUBARKEX
(LOND 5337). Our only trace is OFLA 39346, stating he is IDEX He. se are not
clear as to the relationship between IDE! A, Ides G, aad IDEN I, also mentioned
in OELA 39346, which states she “appears to be" IDEN A's wife. According to
ODENVY Paris, nowever, IDEN A is married to IDz\ J. OLL 39251 of Septender
1964 reported that Ive A and iis wife (unnamed) had successfully sued IWEi B
for salary arrears; the fact that the wife was aiso eaployed recalls the
IDEU I prefessional status, which might nake her operationally significant
whether or not she is married to IDEN A.

| One of the most violent reactions came from the heart—
land of capitalism, from the small American faction which pre-
duces the monthly Hammer & Steel Newsletter in Boston. Tne
October issue of the mimeographed oulletin vengefully gives
list of eight reasons why Khrushchev fell -~ each one a vin-

dictive crow of triumph, and many attacking not only Khrush-

! _ Chev but basic Soviet policies such as "the distortion of
i peaceful coexistence.” Points 2, 3 and 8 will serve as illus- .
3 trations: !

2. ‘Hie German policy -- Khrushchev sought to ingratiate
himself with West Germany. He was obviously ready
to sell out the German Democratic Republic...

fd
|
3. The declining influence of the CPSU among the Social- .
** dst countries and the Communist Parties. The pro- '
posed Moscow gathering was shaping up as a conference
a of only those Party leaders ready to openly serve
U.S. imperialist aggression against the national 1lib-
- eration struggles. For example, Asian supporters of
. Khrushchev could have gathered in a telephone booth.

8. The nuclear success of People's China. Khrushchev
a had maintained that nuclear power was the exclusive
| pencetee of revisionists and imperialists -—-

of white nations. Khrushchev's great power chauvin- :
ism°was blown sy high in Sinkiang Province. a

Although there is no evidence that the politically insig-
nificant Hammer & Steel group enjoys any direct support fron
the Chinese (as the Ruesians alleged in their “Open Letter”

6 it has always offered its allegiance to —
of guiy, 14), 1963) extreme form. This is expressed again 3F
the claim that “Khrushchev's failure to recognize the contra
diction between the oppressed peoples and inperialisn as i e-
focal contradiction of our time resulted in blindness conce B
ing the leading réle of the Chinese Party. 8 nis 15 a cial
that the Chinese themselves would not want to make, expecially
at this juncture.
