CHINESE COMMUNIST LEADERS" AFRICAN ‘TOUR : eee

The Communist World

jected two-month tour of Africa
completed, Chou En-lai and For-
eign Minister Chen Yi can claim
| high marks for their efforts to
| project an aura of Afro-Asian
amity and to identify Peiping
\with African aspirations. There
jis no evidence, however, that
they have scored any comparable
success in the political or eco-
nomic fields.

: The joint communiqué issued
on 21 December at the conclusion
of the Chinese leaders' visit to
Cairo contains few surprises,
and reports from Algiers suggest
that discussions with Ben Bella
are following predictable lines.
Thus far the Chinese have at-
tempted to minimize differences,
play up past contacts, and press
such themes as militant struggle
against colonialism and "US im-
perialism,."

In both Algiers and Cairo,
Chou" s hosts sought to demon-
strate their nonalignment by
actions designed to play down
the impact of the Chinese lead-
ers! arrival. Chou was greeted
in Cairo with a 21-gun salute,
but Nasir was not on hand. In
Algeria, Ben Bella was on hand
to greet his guests, but the top-
level delegation he sent to the
Soviet Union just before Chou's
arrival is receiving more pub-
licity than the Chinese guests.

| It has become increasingly
apparent that a major objective
of the trip has been to undercut

re “With. ‘two 4 weeks_of. _theirpro-_|

continent.._Criticism of the
USSR was reportedly a recurrent
theme in Chou's four lengthy
talks with Nasir. Nasir report-
edly said that Chou talked about

the USSR the way the Soviets |

used to talk about the US. He
accused the Soviets of trying
to colonize China, of breaking

political and economic promises,

and of becoming tools of the

US, and he warned that any Afro-

Asian country which became de-

et

pendent on Moscow would suffer
the same fate as Peiping.

In Algeria, Chou sounded a
similar note. He cited China's
early support for Algerian rev-
olutionaries-~support which ac-

tually pre-dated that of the USSR.|

He has also undoubtedly scored
Soviet unreliability. The Chi-
nese may be pressing the Algerians
to use some of the $50-million |
credit offered in October. This.
offer was made to counter a $100-
million Soviet credit offered
earlier the same month. :

Sino-Soviet rivalry for
African support also flared at
the UN, where Peiping outmaneu-
vered Moscow on the question of
enlarging the representation in
principal UN organs to accommo-
date the African bloc. Soviet .
delegate Fedorenko had attempted |
to make it appear that the Chi-

nese were opposed to the African-

sponsored expansion plan because |
they insisted that any change

in the UN be tied to Peiping's |<

own admission to the Security
Council. The USSR found itself

EAST GERMAN REACTION TO RELAXATION

ia -~-Reaction of East- Germans —
to, the agreement to let West
Berliners visit relatives in
East Berlin is hopeful but still
fairly cautious, judging by re-
ports from local party officials.

The party central head-
quarters, obviously concerned
that the agreement might have
domestic repercussions, ordered
district officials to submit
| Foliownce reports and detailed
| follow-ups on reactions to this

| partial relaxation of travel
‘curbs imposed in connection
with the building of the Berlin
Wall. Most of the responses
state that the people are elated
but are publicly voicing hope
that they may be permitted to
visit their relatives in West
Berlin and West Germany. Many
East Germans express hope that

the present move will be followed

| by other relaxations-~a reaction

probably quite unpalatable to
| the regime.

Ta

OF BERLIN TRAVEL

ea ie party -headquarters--is-still-———

fairly cautious:
member in Magdeburg said: "The
reason we don't let our citizens
go to West Germany is that we
are afraid they will defect."
But he was promptly silenced by
comrades who parroted the party
line on "the terror against our
GDR citizens in West Germany."

Public expression of dis-
satisfaction with harsh travel
and internal controls has been

‘recurrent in recent months,
reaching a peak prior to the
20 October parliamentary elec-
tions.

The people's reaction to
the pass agreement with West
Berlin points up one of the re-
gime's major problems: how to
project an image of itself as a
sovereign state and of East Ber-
lin as its capital without in-
creasing discontent among its
population, who still risk shoot-
ing if they attempt to escape
to West Berlin. (SECRET KIMBO)

NORTH KOREA IMPROVES AIR DEFENSE (CAPABILITY

___North_ Korea has. recently————-.
taken several steps which signif.
icantly strengthen its air de-
fenses. MIG-21 (Fishbed) jet
fighters, which were first de-
tected only at Pukchang-ni air-
field, now are being stationed

at other airfields. Pyongyang
has also apparently just acquired
a large number of relatively
sophisticated types of radar
sets. In addition, the North
Korean bomber force, which has

a total of about 100 IL-28
(Beagle) jet light bombers, is

in part now equipped with, and
has been training with, an im-
proved blind bombing and naviga-
tional system.

Testing of and flight train-
ing with the new fighters-~10
to 14 of which were apparently
obtained from the USSR in the
fall of 1962--were first noted
in communications intelligence
in June 1963, Since that time
the MIG-21s have been detected
frequently in flight activity
involving ground controlled in-
tercept exercises,
| Beginning in October, MIG~
21s have been noted operating
from Wonsan on the east coast
of North Korea. Their deploy-
ment to this airfield places
supersonic fighters on both the
east and west coasts of North
Korea.

The North Koreans have re-
cently-expanded—their radar.

radar, at least one of which '
is believed to be exclusively '
of Chinese Communist manufacture,
have been detected. For the
present these radars will ap-
parently supplement rather than

replace North Korea's original if

three types--Kniferest A, SCR-
270, and Token, |

The identifiable new types :
include Kniferest B, Spoonrest i
A, and a new type of Chinese Com- |
munist origin which is probably
a substantial modification of
the SCR-270. Spoonrest A is
sometimes used as the acquisi-
tion radar for surface-to-air
missile sites, but it is also
used in an early warning role
and is probably intended for that
use in North Korea. Acquisition
of these new radars reflects
North Korea's efforts to extend i
the range of its early warning
detection system. To improve
height-finding capability, Pyong-
yang has also introduced more
sophisticated radars such as
Rockcake and Stonecake.

Another improvement in North
Korea's air capability is the
equipment of about twenty IL-28s
with an improved blind bombing
and navigational radar system des-
ignated Shorewalk, When properly
used, this system permits preci-

sion navigation and blind bombing
without the use of ground communi-

-|- coverage. _-Six new types o of |

ENTHUSIASM FOR SOUTH VIETNAM REGIME FLAGGING

— Communist guerrilla activ-
ity increased only slightly in
connection with the third anni-
| versary, on 20 December, of the
Viet Cong's Liberation Front,
despite advance Communist propa-
ganda exhortation for a major
military effort. The Viet Cong
continued to direct attacks and
harassing activities primarily
at strategic hamlets.

i -
i South Vietnam's new govern-
ment is showing extreme sensi-
tivity to discussion of a "neu-
tralist solution" to its in-
surgency problem.
Liberation Front has repeatedly
proposed Such a settlement, and
the idea is gaining new advocates
as a result of Cambodia's call
for an international conference.
Saigon's military rulers last
week closed down a newspaper
which was expressing interest in
heutralism, However, editorials
in the vernacular press, even
though attacking neutralism, have

On 20 December, Saigon students--
possibly encouraged by the re-
gime--demonstrated against neu-
tralism.

| On the military front, the
government is beginning to take
some steps to overcome the leth-
argy that has affected its coun-
terinsurgency effort since the
coup. A long-range pacification
program has been launched in one
of the most troublesome provinces
in the northern part of the coun-
try, and broad command changes
have been introduced in two prov-
inces south of Saigon where
security has been deteriorating.

Council of Notables. Returned
exiles apparently are not rep-
resented, and there is a dearth
of direct provincial represen-
tation. Many appointees, how-
ever, are prominent political,
professional and lay religious
leaders who could provide effec-
tive guidance to the regime if
they are given a chance,

Apathy and disenchantment
over the new government are wide-
spread among such key elements
as middle-grade officers, stu-
dents and politicians. Criti-
cism centers on the lack of
firm direction by the ruling gen-
erals, on repeated reshuffling
of local officials deemed in-
competent, corrupt or close to
the Diem regime, and on the rise
in Viet Cong activity. There
are signs that junta members
themselves are beginning to share
the disillusionment of some cir-

sional cabinet, which is described
as ineffective and regional in
outlook.

Leading generals nevertheless
seem to have few effective steps
in mind to rally popular support.
Three generals recently complained
to US officials that they were hav~-
ing trouble finding qualified
Vietnamese to fill government posi-
tions and that press criticism
of their efforts was unhelpful.
General "Big"' Minh, the chief of
state, has indicated a personal
distaste for a prominent role,
and has asserted that the people
would gradually come to appreciate
the new government as problems
were solved on a province-by
province-basis. (SECRET NO FOR-

FRENCH CABINET MINISTER TO VISIT CAMBODIA
Armed Forces= {-milttary—aid—probably—w

ierre Messmer's visit to Cam-
‘bodia from 4-7 January is de-

igned primarily to strengthen

rench influence there in the
‘wake of Prince Sihanouk's call
‘for an end to the US aid pro-
gram. Messmer's high-level

ntourage, which includes the
‘Chiefs of the Foreign Ministry's
[Indochina and Cultural and Tech-
ical divisions, will probably
' recommend some increases in aid,
but De Gaulle apparently has

no intention of taking on any

large new commitments.

French-grant aid to Cam-
- bodia since 1956 has amounted
to only $15 million. Current
assistance is threefold: a
ilitary training mission of at
east 250 men; cultural aid in
_(the form of a university mission
and 319 teachers in Cambodian
schools; and the maintenance of
{about 40 experts in the fields
of health and public works. In
laddition, a number of French
.jmationals hired by the Cambodian
Government hold positions of
considerable influence in the
inistry of Finance, the Treas-
ry, and the premier's office,
nd are among Prince Sihanouk's
advisers.

Paris has indicated it has

be limited to reconditioned and
obsolete equipment, such as
trucks and light armored vehicles|,
Increased cultural and technical
assistance probably would include
further help for the French uni-
versity mission, more teachers,
and 30 or 40 additional technical
experts, especially agricultural-
ists.

The extension of French aid
will be complicated by Cambodia's
claims for compensation for
losses incurred as a result of
the 1958 devaluation of the
French franc. Since 1958 France
has asserted that a large-scale
aid program would be impossi-
ble until there is agreement on
an exchange rate, but a compro-
mise may now be in sight.

Sihanouk has sought French
help in maintaining Cambodia's ©
policy of neutrality, and in
recent talks with the US and the
UK, France has supported his
call for an international con-
ference on Cambodian neutral-
ity, despite US objections.
Indeed, De Gaulle has consist-
ently sought to meet Sihanouk
more than half way, and Paris
may now encourage Sihanouk
to press this issue. (CON- |

ARABS PLAN NO OVERT ACTION AGAINST ISRAELI PROJECT

ie-Arab States evidently

states with a dilemma. ‘Damascus

not plan any overt military
‘action against Israel when in
late January or early February
.the Israelis begin pumping tests
for their Jordan River diversion
project, but sabotage of the
project's facilities may be at-
tempted.

t The Arab military chiefs
who met in Cairo in mid-December
apparently decided that direct
military attacks are not feasi-

le. The chiefs reportedly
a@greed, however, that the states
bordering on Israel should

lount ‘independent and uncoor-

inated clandestine operations.

The Arab League Defense
Council, which meets in January,
robably will approve this rec~
ommendation, but its implementa-
ion is another matter. Egyp-
ian, Jordanian, and Lebanese
Yahiths have indicated pri-
vately that their governments
have no intention of taking
aggressive action of any kind
pee inst the Israeli project.

Nasir, however, told the
Canadian ambassador in early
December that he was worried
a Syria might act unilater-

will be under strong pressure
to fulfill its threats against
the Israeli scheme, particularly
in view of the close proximity
of the Syrian border to Israel's
pumping station on Lake Tiberias.

Nasir's wariness about be-

;. coming involved in a war with

Israel over Jordan waters was
also evident in a speech he

made on 23 December. He empha-
sized that the problem is polit~
ical rather than military in
nature and that the chiefs of
staff cannot solve it. He
called for a summit meeting of
Arab presidents and kings to
seek a solution.

Israel, according to the

-chief of Israeli military in-
-telligence, considers there is

an outside possibility that
Syria might bomb or shell the
pumping facility's transformer
station. However, the Israelis |
believe the primary threat stems

which. began on 21 December and

espite efforts to obtain a cease-
ire, is the culmination of a
teady growth of tension on the
Sland during the past few weeks.
he new tension followed Presi-
ent Makarios' presentation to
rkish Cypriot leaders of propos-
_ pis for changing the Cyprus con-
‘Jstitution. The proposals, which
jessentially involved removing the
guarantees to the Turkish minor-
ity that had been written into
-\the Cyprus settlement of 1959,
-\were rejected by the Turkish Gov-
: ernment even before the Turkish
‘Cypriots had made their views
known.

Most of the initial fight-
ing appears to have been between:
Greek Cypriot police and the Turk-
ish underground, and to have taken
place in the Turkish areas of Nic-
osia.. The situation there de-
| teriorated progressively during
the week, as the police lost con-
trol to extremist groups of ir-
regulars from both communities.
‘fA cease-fire, to be supervised
by the British, had not been ef-

| fective as of the morning of 26

tinued at the port city of Lar-
{maca; the rest of the island was

Inthe face of these de=—~
velopments, the Turkish Govern-
ment threatened to exercise its
right under the 1959 agreement
to intervene on Cyprus. Three
Turkish jet fighters flew over
Nicosia on 25 December, and
Turkish naval units appeared off
the island. Part of the 650-man
Turkish garrison on Cyprus left )
its barracks to move into one |
of the Turkish quarters of the
capital. Part of the 950-man j
Greek contingent then moved to
protect Greek areas. The situa-
tion evidently prodded Athens (
and London into a more active f
role, and Greek, Turkish and
British forces on Cyprus have
been placed under a unified Brit
ish-led command. Britain has an
nounced it is sending 150 ad-
ditional troops.

The violence may make lead-
ers of both sides more cautious
in pressing political demands.
Soon after the outbreak, Makarios
told the US ambassador he would

THE COMMON MARKET CRISIS

Europe

vente cS ommon Market appears to ;
averted disaster forthe sec—
nd time in less than a year. The
eleventh—hour agreements reached

on agricultural policy on 23 De-
“ecember are apparently sufficient

o discourage De Gaulle from carry-
ng out his threat to break up the
community. Moreover, the Germans
and Dutch succeeded in extracting
limited commitments from Paris on
BEC participation in the Kennedy
Round of tariff negotiations. These
agreements do not cover all the out-
standing issues, however, and the
lanner in which they were reached
will leave a residue of bitterness,
or is it certain that major US
interests have fared well.

The main agricultural elements
in the "package" deal are the reg-
lations concerning intracomnunity
trade in beef, rice, and dairy prod-
ucts and the rules governing the
‘¢ommunity farm fund. Their effect

though approval of these and the
financial regulations is an im-
portant step forward, the key ques-
tion of grain price unification is
Istill unsettled. Further considera-
tion of the formula proposed by Com-
missioner Mansholt has been delayed
uhtil next year. i

| The agreement on a Kennedy
Round position is likewise an ad-
spnce for the community, but from
the US view not necessarily favor-
ble. On the long-standing problem
of tariff "disparities," the EEC
dopted a formula which would
axempt from the proposed 50-per-
cent linear reduction in tariffs
aj far larger number of items than
(the US-hoped for. The -EEC-positio

; one

on farm products in the trade ne- =~
gotiations--although an improvement
over the initial Mansholt propos-
als--also leaves much to be desire
from the US view. In general, the
EEC proposes that, if its levy sys-
tem operates in such a way as to
cause difficulties for the exports
of nonmembers, then the EEC Commis
sion will be called on to propose
"appropriate," but unspecified,
measures, These would not apply
if it is technically impossible to
determine how much protection is
actually involved in the levy sys-
tem.

The general relief within
the community which greeted these
agreements reflects both the
depth of the crisis and some op-
timism that the Common Market's
unity may have been restored. The
prominent role played by the
EEC's commission in achieving
the compromise has in particu-
lar encouraged those who hope to
strengthen the community's in-
stitutional structure.

In France the conviction
was evidently widespread, how-
ever, that both Bonn and The
Hague were quite prepared to see
the French "leave" the Common Mar-
ket, and in the event of its
breakup, to seek alternative
ties with the Outer Seven. More-
over, while it may prove healthy
that Bonn “stood up" to De Gaulle
in this instance, its motive was
strongly colored by a desire to pro-
tect its inefficient farmers, Nor
does it augur well for US-EEC re-
lations that the French blame the
US for much of the opposition
they_encountered. __ (SECRET-NO.

UK-US FRICTIONS OVER SHIPPING POLICY

Thus, what are seen as Ny

( j= British shipping and offi~
jcial circles are incensed over

recent US demands for informa-

tion relating to rate discrim-

ination against US exports.
The British Government has ad-
vised against compliance on
the grounds that this informa-
tion is commercially confiden-
tial, and that the US cannot
demand what the UK Government
cannot obtain.

Following a recent con-
gressional investigation into
alleged rate discrimination
against American exports, the
US Maritime Commission asked
the North Atlantic Freight Con-
ference to explain the differ-—
‘ehtials on a long list of items,
setting a 20 January deadline
for compliance under penalty

of, heavy fines. The US posi-
tion is that US exporters are
being penalized because outward
rates are higher on the average
than the inward rates.

British and other shipping
lines regard the differentials
as} economically justified. The
tonnage of US exports is much
reater than import tonnage,
and shipping lines--anxious to
void half-loaded or in-ballast
estbound voyages--have tradi-
ignally charged lower rates

or items imported into the US
han for exports from this

American efforts to regulate y
international shipping lines in
order to improve the unfavorabl
US balance of payments have :
caused increasing rancor in
Britain. Before Parliament ad-
journed for its Christmas reces
on 20 December, some Conserva- i
tive MPS called for retaliator
restrictions on US ships arriv-
ing at UK ports. Although the
MPS did not specify what re-
strictions they had in mind,

the government cannot afford

in the present pre-election
period to leave itself open

to charges that it is not atten-
tive enough to domestic interest

The Douglas-Home government,
while hopeful of some compromise
before the 20 January deadline,
is busily lining up international
support. At the recently con-
cluded conference of transport
ministers of 10 European mari-
time nations, Britain proposed
that Japan be invited to join
the united front of European
maritime countries in a general
protest against US shipping
policies, thereby aligning
roughly three quarters of the
world's shipping business against
the US position. Japan agreed
to do so, and the collective
protest was filed with the

Brandt's place in the hierarchy
as second deputy chairman. As
the SPD leader, Brandt would
stand to be candidate for chan-

are any indication, the SPD
will give the CDU a strong race
in that contest.

Brandt, however, has not
yet committed himself, since
to accept the SPD chairmanship
might require him to resign as
mayor of Berlin and move to Bonn.
In so doing he would have to
operate at a distance from his

Whatever Brandt decides,
the. SPD is bound to miss the
conciliating influence of Ollen-

DOMESTIC POLITICS IN CUBA

Fidel Castro is continuing his
effort to reduce the influence of
the veteran Communists who were lead-
ers of the Moscow-oriented, pre-rev-
olutionary Communist party of Cuba.
Castro's campaign against then,
launched in a bitter attack in March
1962, subsequently seemed to lose
steam. Recent reports from knowl-
edgeable clandestine sources, how-
ever, indicate that the old liners
are again on the defensive and are
likely to suffer further in govern-
ment shake-ups which may be in the
offing. Castro nevertheless con-
tinues to move slowly in order to
avoid undue disruption within his
regime.

The only major veteran Commu-
nist figure to remain in Castro's
good graces is Carlos Rafael Rod-
riguez, the head of the National
Agrarian Reform Institute. Rod-
riguez' position has actually been
strengthened in recent weeks with
the raising of his job to cabinet
level, He has evidently convinced
Castro of his personal loyalty and
of his ability as an administrator.
It is also possible that Rodriguez
performs a useful and trusted liai-
son role between Castro and Soviet
leaders. He returned to Havana on
22 December after a two-week trip
to the USSR and several Soviet satel-
lites where, according to press ac-
counts, he. was in contact with high-
ranking Communist Party officials.

The old-line Cuban Communists

remain strong, according to a re-

cent clandestine report, in the in-
termediate and lower echelons of
the military and party hierarchies.
Wherever possible, they continue

their "sectarian" efforts to secure
positions for their comrades at the
expense of Fidelistas. A clandes-
tine source reported hearing "ru-
mors" in high regime circles late
last month that veteran Communists
have banded together in clandestine
cells to work against Castro.

Che Guevara continues to be the
Cuban leader most openly critical of
the Soviet Union and the most’ insist-
ent on the "necessity" of accelerat-
ing the revolution in Latin America.
Fidel Castro is said to agree with
Guevara's position, but awareness of
Cuba's own self-interest still com-
pels him to be more cautious in pur-~
suing policies that could be inter-
preted as anti-Soviet, It neverthe-
less remains a key regime policy to
encourage Communist revolution in
Latin America.

A clandestine source who is a
high-level Cuban diplomat asserts
that Cuban leaders privately recog-
nize that popular discontent with
the regime is widespread. He claims,
however, that they are confident
their unpopularity has reached its
nadir, and that they are beginning
to make up lost ground. They ex-
pect, for instance, that economic
difficulties--a major source of
discontent--will be largely over-
come within three years. The strat-
egy of the government, this source re-
ports, is to hold on untii the econ-
omy improves and until Cuban subver-
sive efforts elsewhere in Latin
America result in the establishment
of one or more Communist allies in
the hemisphere. Then, the regime
feels, it will be secure. (SECRET NO

appointment may be a temporary
expedient designed to allay
fears that Brizola would succeed
Pinto. Galvao is a personal
friend of Brizola and there is
speculation that Brizola will,
in fact, eventually move into
the Finance Ministry.

The new finance minister
inherits almost insurmountable
economic and financial problems.
Chief among these are a rampant
inflation that may see the cost
of living increase 80 percent
this year, and a staggering
foreign debt involving approxi-
mately $1 billion in payments
due over the next two years.

The severity of the eco-
nomic situation and Goulart's
apparent intention to assume
greater personal direction over
financial policies increase
the possibility of radical meas-
ures that might be detrimental
to foreign creditors and in- .

‘ vestors. Goulart reportedly is

considering nationalization of
