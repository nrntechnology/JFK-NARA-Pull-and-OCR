MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
SUBJECT : Compromise of Cover _ :

1. As a re5ult of information obtained from reliable
sources who served in Vietnam, we have established that
the former Staff personnel listed on the attachment should
be presumed to have been compromised as CIA employces to
the North Vietnam Intelligence Service as of April 1975.
We presume also that the identifications of these individ-
uals as CIA employees were passed by the North Vietnamese

to the Soviets.

: 2. Although the personnel listed, in the attachment

are no longer employed by CIA, nevertheless, I suggest
that their official personnel records should be documented
concerning possiblé past compromise of their cover.

3. Ple e coordinate any action connected with this
memorandum with Chief, CCS; Chief, CMG; and Chief, CI

Staff.

Ben -
: Stan Archenhold, x 7264, one of the Agency's drug cuordinators

with DEA, called me yesterday afternoon, DEA had requested a memo

verifying employment of Mr. Lucien E, Conein, whose name has

appeared frequently during the Watergate hearings. The attached

memorandum is what Archenhold wants.

-Conein's service was verified with ROB; his “honorable service"
was cleared with SAS. Since he was under cover as contract, I dis-
cussed the cace with Dick Biladeau of Central Cover. CCS had
opened up Conein last year and Biladean approved release of the
information to DEA. We had verified this service to a Justice Depart-

ment investigator approximately one year ago when Conein was being
considered as a consultant for BNDD. .

Archenheld offered to carry the memorandum to DEA,

At the personal request of the Prime Minister hoe has bocome senior

showing some improvement over the previous report, still needs

MEMORANDUM FOR: Clandestine Services Personnel Division

ATTENTION - : Agent Panel

SUBJECT : Deletion of ‘Arthur R, SCHWICKRATH from
, Project IUJEWEL roster.

1. Arthur R, SCHWICKRATH has been employed as a Career
Agent in Project IUJEWEL since 16 October 1961, During that
period he was assigned to the Saigon Station as a Staff
Advisor on Paramititary matters to the Chief of Station.

. 2. When at the termination of that assignment,
SCHWICKRATH returned to Headquarters, it was assumed by SOD
that he would return to SOD and be again covered by Project
IUJEWEL, However, I now understand that SCHWICKRATH is being
processed for an assignment in WH Division and is, in fact,
engaged in languago training for that assignment,

3. In view of the foregoing, it 13 vequested that the
name of Arthuc R, SCHWICKRATH be removed from the Project

IUJEWEL personnel assets.

SUBJECT: Promotion -

1, In view of present and past Fitness Reports, aad
by. comparison with other ZRJEWEL personnel, I believe thet
‘the promotion of EBSD vo GS-14 equivalent: ip Justified,
and that it would be in order to convey this view to
FE/Personne). Technically ver, the administration of
(and decision to, promote) is a responsibility of
FE Division until roverts to SOD under ZRIEWEL.

2. I would strongly recommend against any move to
request Aray to advance GS3GED's retired status {roe
Lt. Col, to Col.e although, for operational purposes’ white
he is at Ssigoo it might be possible to give him notional
or “assimilated” rank.

GENCE ACTIVITIES IN-VIFTNAM SINCE 1545, IN ADDITION, THE STATION
HAS JUOGEO. THAT HIS BEST UTILIZATION HAS GEEN AS A REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE CHIEF OF STATION IN VARIOUS COMMITTEE MEETINGS ANO LIAISONS
WHERE IT WAS NECESSARY HE CE IDENTIFIEO AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
COS. fT WOULD BE GOTH IMPOSSIBLE AND COUNTER-PROSUCTIVE IN
SCHWICKRATH'S CASE TO ATTEMPT TO HICE COMPLETELY HIS AFFILIATION
WITH KUBARK.

SECURITY FOR SCHWICKRATH.

. 6. DURING HIS CURRENT TOUR, SCHWICKRATH HAS ACQUIRED IN-
CREASING SKILL AND FAMILIARITY IN THE INTRICACHES OF, KUBARK STAFF
WORK, BOTH AT THE. INTER-STATION LEVEL AND THE INTGA-MISSION LEVEL.
THIS 1S A NEW CAPACITY FOR SCHWICKRATH WHO HAS MERETOFORE BEEN
KNOWN AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION OFFICER. SCHWICKRATH HAS PER-
FORMED THESE NEW OUTIES WITH CONSIDERASLE FINESSE DESPITE A VERY
RAPID BUILDUP OF PARAMILITARY ASSETS WITHIN VIETNAM AND AN EXTREMELY

: FLUID COMMAND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE U.S. MILITARY

: | CIVILIAN FRREGULAR ASSETS IN VIETNAM FROM THE STATION TO MACV.
SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE AT THAT CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE CON-
FERENCE'S ADOPTING ALL STJIVON RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPECT TO ITS
FUTURE ROLE IN CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ACTIVITIES. AT THE SAME TIME
SCHWIGKRATH'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE, HARMONIOUS
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KUBARK, CINCPAC AND MACV.

MEMBER OF OUR STAFF WITH AN INDISPENSABLE OEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND

BACKGROUND ON SOUTH VIETNAM ANO ON ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FE Division

SUBJECT: Employment of Lou Conein -

1, At my request, General Lanadale has quictly checked
on the status of Lou Concin's retirement from the Army. He is |
presently in Iran aad is slated for return héme and retirement in

‘ August. He haa made an effort to return sooner but the Iranian. an
Government protested that it would be an act of bad faith (apparently, . _ oe
he is doing a good job with them). ‘

a AOR SH sSNA RON ALCE NESMORIM MERRION A ee

2. At the moment, Conein belongs to ACSI and Lansdale
feels that any move on our part to accelerate hia return would be
misinterpreted, or perhaps I should say correctly interpreted,
by ACSI, lam getting his addross and will establish contact-with |
him by personal letter, Lansdale feels that Conein is very anxious

to come back to work for the Agency,

an unheard-of thing. As you are aware, af in the case of French service
officers assigned to the to the TUTOR ORG, so are selected military
personnel assigned to KUBARK. Very recently two seafor ODIBEX officers
on the KUHOCK Senior Staff were released at ODIBEX request by KUBARK

and subsequently transferred to ODIOWN, Thailand, with no further KUBARK

connection. .

In spite of sincere protestations and denials on your part, we realize
of course that at least some bit of suspicion will linger on in TUTOR's
mind and that these suspiciona will not be allayed ty even the most
circumspect of routine contacts between persons in VILLIER's group and
members of the SIM Staff. Such contacts are bound to occur, particularly
if the VILLIERS group dees indeed succeed in getting an HIARCADE program
of any sort in motion. However, as we have stated, thia fa an accepted
jisk, and we have to play the game out, even thous we cannot assess

the possible damage to the SIM liaison. .
