Venezuela

a. The country's six presiden-
tial candidates have swung into the
home stretch of their campaigns.

So have the terrorists, who are still
trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's
vote.

b. There is little doubt that
_the terrorist effort has all-out
Cuban support. Castro looks on
Venezuela as his prime target in
Latin America and would ‘do everything
in his power to prevent President
Betancourt from finishing his term,

ce. So far, the terrorists have
tried to intimidate the candidates .
by harassing political rallies, bomb-
ing their party headquarters in
various cities, and threatening them
with assassination. They have tried
to scare voters from the polls by
creating a general atmosphere of law-
lessness. Kidnappings, like the one
yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault,
are part of the pattern,

d. The government counterattack
is under the personal direction of
Betancourt, who is as determined to
finish out his term and turn over

. power to a freely-elected successor
as Castro is to prevent this.

e. Yesterday it was announced
that the carrying of firearms by
anyone outside the security forces
was forbidden until the elections
are over,

f. Some 3,000 reservists have
been called up to protect the polls.
Leaves are being cancelled and all
security forces are maintaining a
high state of alert.

2. South Vietnam a, We now have a fuller ac-
count from official US sources of
the Viet Cong attack on two mountain
villages mentioned in Tuesday's
Checklist.

b. This account makes it clear
that the earlier press versions,
‘which spoke of 1,000 missing vil-
lagers, were highly colored,

. ¢e. Our present information
is that the attack, in company
strength, was successfully repulsed.
The Viet Cong suffered some 30 cas-
ualties; government losses were six
killed, three wounded and 39 missing.

(Cont'd)

d. As is usual in these cases,
the villagers began to trickle back
+ once the Viet Cong left.

e. This episode aside, we see
“a number of indications that the
Communists will try to sustain the
higher level of military activity
“they have kept up since the coup.

f. The Communist radio has
called for more attacks in an effort
to destroy strategic hamlets and
"develop" Viet Cong forces. In sup-

. port of this, Viet Cong communica-
tions traffic has been unusually
heavy and has involved a large vol-
ume of high priority traffic and
special alert patterns,

“(Includes INTERCEPTS)

3. Israel : a. We have some reason to be-
lieve that the Israelis are develop-
ing a surface-to-surface missile of
their own.

. b. A reliable clandestine
source says that an Israeli repre-
sentative is trying to buy US stable
platforms for the inertial guidance
System of a missile with a range of
300-350 miles. He wanted delivery
in six to twelve months, There have
been several earlier reports that

4, USSR-India

Israel is buying missile components
in the US and England.

c. We think this missile pro-
gram is independent of another
Israeli venture: Tel Aviv's con-
tract with a French firm, Marcel
Dassault, for the development of a
system which will be able to deliver
a 1,600-pound warhead to a maximum
range of 300 miles.

a. Moscow has promised the
Indians to ship the equipment for
one surface-to-air (SAM) training
site early next month.

b. The Soviets had agreed to
provide eight SAM sites. The rest
will probably not be sent until the
Indians have learned to handle the
equipment about a year from now.

. As we noted last Sunday,
there are some Indians who have

‘ doubts about the Soviet willingness

to live up to the letter of their
military aid agreements with New
Delhi,

Burma

d. They call into question
especially the contract for the
Soviets to set up in India a facility
to assemble MIG fighters--an enter-
prise which has appeared somewhat
impractical from the beginning.

e. We do note, however, that
Soviet aircraft specialists working
on the project were still in New
Delhi in early November.
(INTERCEPTS)

a. Ne Win has followed up his
action in breaking off talks with
the Burmese Communists by arresting
over 700 of their number.

b. Ne Win had been trying to
lure the faction-ridden Communists
into a "national front." However,
he found the demands of the Commu-
nist negotiators, some of whom had
only just returned from long exile
in Peiping, to be impossible.

c. This will probably lead to
renewed fighting between the army
and Communist guerrillas in the hills.

ad. More trouble can also be
expected from the rebellious ethnic
minorities Like the Karens and the

Kachins, whose demands for greater
autonomy have been rejected in Ran-
goon, :

e. US officials on the spot
doubt that the army, hobbled by poor
leadership and its many political
responsibilities, will be any more
effective in dealing with the prob-
lem this time than in past anti-
insurgency campaigns.

6. Cambodia a. Sihanouk has signed an ac-
cord setting up regular air service
between Cambodia and Communist China,
A similar agreement with Hanoi is
in the works,

b. These lines are significant
largely as gestures by Peiping and
Hanoi to bolster Sihanouk's sense
of importance. Neither would be a
paying proposition commercially and
both could flounder before the first
paying passenger enplanes unless
rights to overfly Laos can be obtained.
(Includes INTERCEPTS) —

7. Greece a. It looks more and more as
if Papandreou, who squeaked through
to a narrow upset victory over ex-
premier Karamanlis in the 3 November
elections, will not be able to form
@ government.

. (Cont 'd)

For The President Only - Top Secret
b. His party does not have a
parliamentary majority, so he needs
Support from either Karamanlis'
party on the right or from the Com-
munists. The military has apparently
been pressing Karamanlis to withhold
that support. He does not need much
urging.

ce. The military has also let
it be known that it would consider _
Papandreou's acceptance of Communist
support as sufficient reason for a
coup d'etat.

gd. In/addition to this military
string-pulling, the royal family is
also meddling--not for the first
_ time. Should Papandreou fail to
' form a government, the palace intends
to pass the mandate to Karamanlis,
believing that he too would fail.

e. This would then open the
way, the palace calculates, for a
compromise premier more amenable to
palace influence.

8. Brazil a. President Goulart and his
opponents are keeping political ten-
sions in Brazil high.

(Cont'd)

For The President Only - Top Secret
b. Comments by Goulart, that
_ "social disaster" is sure if his
program is not passed soon, have drawn
sharp rejoinders from moderate and
conservative figures and have fed
rightist coup plotting.

c. Strains are also growing in
the military following the arrest
of a young officer who refused last
month to execute an order to arrest
Governor Lacerda, a leading conserva-
tive spokesman and likely presidential
candidate.

NOTES

USSR Simultaneous activity this morning on the

‘Tyuratam missile test range, satellite tracking nets

and Soviet space support ships in the Atlantic prob-
ably represented an attempt to Launch.an unmanned
earth satellite. The launch apparently failed on
the pad or was cancelled at the last moment, It

may be tried again soon. (INTERCEPTS)

Rumania-US Rumanian officials are about to award
a US firm, Ferguson and Company of Cleveland, Ohio, -
a $32 million contract to help build the huge Galati
steel plant. The Rumanians are pressing ahead with
this project in the face of Soviet efforts to dis-
courage it in various ways, most importantly by re-
fusing to underwrite the scheme to any substantial
degree. .

Turkey The New Turkey Party has followed the
Peasant Party in withdrawing from the present three-
party coalition government, This means that the
coalition has to all intents and purposes collapsed,
even though no formal action will be taken until
Prime Minister Inonu returns from Washington this
weekend,

Thailand The Thai doctors attending Sarit now ad-

mit for the first time that the Prime Minister is in

critical condition. Our doctor agrees with this
prognosis. US officials in Bangkok believe that the
most likely successor would be Thanom Kittikachorn,
now deputy prime minister and minister of defense.
Thanom is not likely to last long, however, since he
is neither a strong personality nor a figure of great
weight in the military hierarchy.

Indonesia-Philippines A Philippine foreign office
Man States that everything was set, as we noted yes-
terday, for Sukarno to visit Manila today. This
official says, however, that the visit was postponed
as a result of Macapagal's decision to attend Presi-
dent Kennedy's funeral,

Indonesia Djakarta is giving every indication that
it will hold up final action on the long-pending oil
contracts with US companies in an attempt to smoke
us out on the question of US aid policy toward Indo-
nesia.

Rwanda-Burundi Tribal refugees from Rwanda, now in
Burundi, seem bent on making trouble between the two
countries. Some 3,000 of their number were reported
yesterday to be moving toward the frontier. They
have little military capability, but blood could
flow and require UN intervention.

USSR-Congo. As a further token of the withdrawal
° oviet diplomats we have noted that the Soviet
diplomatic communications link between Moscow and
Leopoldville was shut down last Saturday. (INTER-
