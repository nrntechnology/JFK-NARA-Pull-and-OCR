May 1963 gent movement in Latin America.. LEONOV left Mexico for the

USSR on 21 April to confer with: KHRUSHCHEV and CASTRO. i

ae uy Credence is given this report: ‘by the publication of a photo~
“ he" Nad graph of the three on 8 May in.a Cuban newspaper. The pho- -

wv : tograph was purportedly taken during a recent neeting. .

}
e (S) (Gp-1) Cuba and Mexico, according to LEONOV’s i
aut schemes, would serve as bases for the insurgency... Cuba H
é would be the "invisible beachhead" and Mexico the point for. Ea
covert distribution of arms. .- : ‘
Cate cend : vs freee (S) (Gp-3) The individual selected as the contact man
: for arms acquisition is said to have been engaged in simi-~
| lar activity in Guatemala about a year ago.
