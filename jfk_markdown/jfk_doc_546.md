Doar Mr. Diaz:

This vill confirm our previous discussions
wherein .e agreed to employ you at the rate of
per month to commence March Ist. As aas explained to yeu
at our last meeting we are cogazed in a study te determine
the effect of large scale misration on given communities
ant the dislocations that result therefron.

we feel that the Miani area is unique in that the dis-
locations caused by the influx of so many of your fellow
countrymen furnishes an excellent opportunity to conduct this

study,
It is anticipated that you will spend a large portion of

your time in our New York offices, however; 21t 211 also
yeeuire a substantial amount of travel on your part.

If you are still in ugreeuent with this proposs:l please
advise me as soon as possible. I sould like to begin this study

on March lst.

Very truly yours,

a6

( Roger soyce)
