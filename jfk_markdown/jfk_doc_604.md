Description

agent of the KDAFGHAN Project since 1962, KDAFGHAN-1's

cover is that of a translator and would-be writer! Family

The only major change during the project year wag the

\

.installation of a-TV monitor/robot camera combination ‘during
October 1970, the month designated as "Cuban month.” | This :
1dded coverage contributed to the comptlat ‘
“studies on several Cuban officials, Piese:

recruitment/defection of these officials, . "

re
Accomplishnents . . Le ae

. rt

lL. The main value of the production of the KDAFGHAN
Project has been in establisning the pattern of various Cuban
Embassy employees, The monitoring has also revealed which
Automobiles: the various employees usually drive, Photographic
coverage of the visitors to the main gate of the Cuban Embassy
and logs of the movement of Cuban Embassy personne} have proved
very useful in identifying new Cuban PCS employees in Mexico,
Normally the Station has been able to match Movements of new
and old employees during. the initial period when duties’ and
contacts were being turned over to the new employees and so
identify their duties.” KDAFGHAN has provided current photographs
of TDY and transiting Cuban officials and Headquarters’ hag :
often provided positive identifications of these persons,
Norberto Hernandez, a DGI headquarters of ficer :
visiting Mexico, was identified in thig way, : |

2. The Station utilizes KDAFGHAN Photographic coverage
and logs to verify the visits of Station assets to the Cuban
Embassy, : |

3. KDAPGHAN aiso Provides coverage of what Appears to

be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy main gate. In the
case of Americans who arrive in automobiles bearing U.S,
license plates, the license Plate number, car description,

and sterile copies of photographs are given to the FSI for
identification. A significant result of the KDAFGRAN operation
included a photographic of a specific individual ~ av old FBI
target - who had been seen visiting the Cuban installation.

4, KDAFGHAN also provided useful coverage for the
KDACOUSTIC-3 operation, an operation aimed at the recruitment
or defection of a DGI officer, This coverage enabled the

’ Station to determine KDACOUSTIC-3's movements, an inportant

factor in timing the calls and visits of our access agents,

This use of the operation should prove extremely va able during
the coming year since a more aggressive recruitment frogram
against the Cuban target is planned,

Problems and Security m he
No agent :control or operational Problems have been ' .

reported, “Neither were there any sccurity problems encountered

‘during the period. Gerald D, FAHLANGER continues to be. the

Case Officer ‘and handler of KDAFGHAN-1, FAHLANGER has met

‘and could continue--to meet KDAFGHAN-2 in an emergency. The

alternate Case Officer is Terence D. SISTONE who meets

KDAFGHAN-1 _FAHLANGER is not available. Both Case Officers

“sa use... During February 1971 the safchouse was
changed: in compliance with normal operational security,

' Meetings are benerally héld once a week, ‘More frequent ||

contact can be made by telephone. ~In an emergency, anyone
can call KDAFGHAN-1 at his home. and say they are a friend:
of "Pepe Simon." KDAFGHAN-1 will reply "I haven't seen him .
since last Christmas," KDAFGHAN~] speaks English,

Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the |
Cuban target in general. He has not been Specifically briefed
on this operation. . : :

Future Plans: :
SS

|

The Station is constantly examining the possibility of
an audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy,
A successful audio device would serve, in most cases, to :
identify the tndividuals who are photographed by KDAFGHAN-1
since they normally identify themselves to the gute house
attendant, There are a few Station assets who have occasional
access to the gate house, and it is conccivable that one of
them could place a quick plant device, provided Security >
conditions are favorable. The Station currently has under.
consideration a recruitment effort aguinst a lower level |
employee of thé Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous
help in such an operation.

Costs:

1. General: This renewal request is tor FY 1972 in |
the amount of $11,950 and FY 1973 in the amount of $11,950,

has "“immigrado” status and has heen associated with the

-*. LIONION Project since 1962. LIONION/2 acts as LIONION/1's
“assistant and fill-in whenever ho is away from tho LIONION

basehouse, .

Changes:

During the project year, the pulse camera coverage of
‘the Cuban Consulate entrance was discontinued, Little or no
use was being made of the product from this camera. One
reason for limited use was that thore was no real way to
readily fix the time--or the day~- a particular photo was
taken. There: were no other significant changes in the
project during FY 1970."

Accomplishments:

. ‘1. The LIONION production for FY 1970 consisted almost
entirely of photographic coverage of visitors to the Cuban
Embassy main entrance and of logs of the movement of Cuban
Embassy personnel and visitors. This proved very useful in
identifying new Cuban Embassy PCS employees in Mexico. The
monitoring also revealed which cars the various employees

usually drove.

2. LIONION also tock photographs of what appeared to. ~
be American visitors to, the Cuban Embassy front gate. In
the case of Americans -who arrived in automobiles bearing
U.S. license. plates, the license plate numbers, car
descriptions, and sterile copies of Photographs were given
to LNERGO tor identification.
.. 3.) The Station also tised the LIONION photographic
coverage and log. to. check on tho reports of Mexican and
other JKLANCE. .asscts who claimed to have visited the Cuban

~ Smbassy, In ‘the case’ of some assets, LIONION/1 was given
w photograph of the. agent and told to be particularly alert

‘ut cortain times of certain days to confirm the agent's
‘ntry and. exit. This proved particularly useful in checking
AVDIME/L's story of contact with the Cubans. It also con-
firmed LIRELIC/1's visit to the Cuban Embassy at an early
Stage in Station recontact with LIRELIC/1.

Probloms :.

.. No agent control or operational problems have been
reported, Noither were there any security problems
encountered during the period. LIONION/1 was mot in a
saftvhouso on an average of once por week by Andrew E.
PELLEMENT, in alias, Following PELLEMENT's departure in
lite May, Gerald .D, FAHLANGER took over the responsibility
for thy LIONION Project. FAHLANGER, in alias, mects LIONION/1
approximately once per week. In January 1970, the Station
had LEONION/1 change the safchouse used for meetings with

' Station officers, Ne signed a one-year lease on the new

apartmont, in alias. LIONION/1 uses the apartment on weekends
and ovonings to lend credence to the cover story he used in
ronting; i.e., that he lives out-of-town and maintains this
small apartment in Mexico City for use during his frequent

visits.

2. Station visits to the LIONION baschouse were limited
to three during the reporting period. These were made during
non-daylight. hours. LIONION/1 picked up the Station officer
away fvom the LIONION ‘basehouse areca and drove the officer
ta the baséhouse in LIONION/1L's own car. The baschouse has
a driveway off the street entrance-way which facilitates
entry during non-daylight hours.

u. . During the Project Year, the pulse camcra and the
electronic equipment used with the LISAMPAN operations were
removed from the baschouse, thus reducing the amount of
compromising cquipment in the basehouse.

‘Future Plans:

Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against ‘the

: Cuban target in general, He has not been specifically

briefed on this operation, — . wt

1. The Station is re-examining the various points of
view which the LIONION baschouse provides of the Cuban
Embassy complex in order to determine what steps can be
taken to improve the usefulness of the LIONION product.
For instance, from the window in the room where the pulse
camera, proviously was installed, an excellent view can be

“had ‘of the’ Cuban Embassy garden and the walkways between

the’ three Cuban Embassy buildings--as well as the Consulate,
‘The’ Station plans’‘to have LIONION/1L, on a spot-check basis,
observe the garden area, In -this way, ‘the Station hopes to
update its information onthe location of the various
otficers' offices, the general pattorn of movement and
activity, | ete. This. area will “also be observed during the
night to see if it-can be determined which areas are being
used for living quarters or offices.

2. It is also planned to assess LIONION/1' gs ability
to observe and draw appropriate conclusions from his obser-
vations, and to write these up for the Station.

3. Depending on the need for Consulate coverage, the
installation of closed circuit -TV coverage of the Consulate
entrance is boing considered.

4. The Station is being quericd as to _ emergency contact
arrangements with LIONION/1.

month's salary as a Christmas ponus. LIONION/1 is reimbursed
for operational expenses related to the project. In the
event of termination, each agent will receive thirty days
actual notice.

6. Funding: All funds are passed by ‘the case officers
during the safchouse meetings with LIONION/1 who receipts for
the funds on the spot. The amount of funds used under this
-project are not enough to arouse the suspicion of LIONION/1

ficient private income to cover the JXLANCE funds he receives,

7. Accounting: All funds are accounted and certified
for in accordance with JKLANCE regulations.

8. Annexes: None.

“16 June 1969

_ MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : LIONION Project Renewal Request

1. Approval is requested of the LIONION Project for the

poriod 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) for $11,994.

Funds are available. cucces saws

2. Project LIONION is a support project which’ provides
the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical
surveillanceof the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.
The surveillance is conducted by two indigenous agents located
in a basehouse directly across from the Cuban compound, At
times the principal agent also acts as a dispatcher fer the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team. Information is radioed to the-
team concerning the departure of Cuban officials, thus allowing
the team to *emain a more discreet distance from the target.

i 3. As reflected in the attached Project Renewal, an
fgudio device planted in the gatehouse of the compound could
be monitored at the LIONION basehouse, aiding greatly in
identifying visitors. Since the time the Station subaitted
the renewal, however, this device ceased to function along
with the rest of the LISAMPAN devices. This’ installation
was monitored through carrier current from the LISAMPAN/
LISASH baschouse,.also situated in front of the compound.
Since the connection between the two basehouses was by carrier
current only, and since the agents in each basehouse are un-
aware of the other's activity, a possible compromise of the
LISAMPAN/LISASH activity should not affect LIONION security.

4. Although the LIONION. Project does not produce dis-

seminable positive intelligence, it is considered by the

Station as essential to its Cuban operations. The 4,100 or
more selective individual photographs produced annually,

+, Coupled with the visual observations, were effectivo tn

Providing timely operational intormation, In addition, over
.8,000.fcet of pulse camera film is produced annually, recording
“the image of cach visitor to the Consulate. The years of ;
experience of the Principal agent have Kiven him intimate
knowledge of- the target Personalities. te often brings matters
tothe immediate attention of the Station without having been
lévied the specific requirement to do so. Asa result, the
Station ts aided greatly in keeping abreast of the day to \
day activities of the Cuban compound. : ,

oo 5. In recent months, the LIONION Project wag useful to |
the Station in checking out statements made by ESMARROW-1, i

6. In March 1969, the Project provided Photos-of three |
U.S. citizens who vistted the Cuban Embassy and were suspected
of being drart dodgers. The Photos were passed to the FBI
within three hours of the request for information,

7. Other than the loss of the audio device in gitchouse,
there have been no changes. The operation continues to run
smoothly, .

8. Approval is recommended.

LIONION FROJECT RENEWAL

A. Objectives

‘ 1. ~Project LIONION, 9 long-term siupport project designed to
provide fix photographic, tecinical, and physical surveillance
of the PBuU Embeesy and Conenlate in Mexico City, has the
following specific objectives:

a. To furnish photographic coverago during daylight
houre of the main entrances to the target inctellation.

b. ‘To operate as a listening post in support of
technical operations agninst thie target to complement the
photogrephic coverage.

@. To radio dispatch physical aurveillance teans
against percons aseociated with the target.

4 4. To aosist the Station in compiling information for
individual dossiers on officials of the target installation.

. e. To fulfill various requirements in support of other
Station PRRUMEN operations.

2. The above-cited objectives are in agreement with the.
over-all objectives of Station Mexico City.

B. Changes

Oliver D. CU“OCH aseumed administrative and operational

reaponsibility for Project LICNION in December 1967 and

continued this responsibility until his departure in December

1668. Pending arrival of CIi0CH!'sa replacement, the Project was

handled by Station Officer Gerald [D. FANLANGEX and Station WOACRE

representative, Walter W. CUORMBURY. On 28 Vebruary 1969, LIONLON~1
‘was introduced to Andrew E, PELLEMEK?, who assumed Project y
“responsibility effective that date. .

Ce. Intelligence Production

As an operational suprort project, Project LIOMIOn does not
produce disseminable positive intelligenca. Quantitatively, .
during. CY 1968, the Project provided cver 4,000 selective individual
photographs of persons and/or vehiclea entering the target
installation and over 8,0CO. feet of pulse camera film. There hes

DP. Effectiveness

1. Project LIOUION is considered by Station Mexico City as
essential to its PBRUIEN operations, It has consistently proven
highly effective and responsive to Station requirezents of both

‘long and short renge nature. LIONION-1, the Project's only full
“time sgent, continues to furnish on a timely tasis, information

on the personalities and ectivities of the target personnel.

- ZIONION-2 continues to backstop LIONION-1 end substitute for hin.

when he is away from his post. .At tne age of 70, she is not
able to man the LIOFICN base full time, and her sight is
failing. She is able to photogreph. visitors, however, and live
monitor the LISAMPAN/DOG traffic. LIONION-2's.role as a .
backstop to LIONTOX-1 insures cortinuous coverage of the target
during daylight hours, five days a week, LIOHION-1's more than

’ gix years of experience working on the same target continue to

produce an increasingly complete and accurate identification of
the staff and visitors to LINING. These years of experience have
developed an agent knowledgeable of WOFIRM operational and ~
security requirements who will often bring to the Station's
attention those matters which he feels are of immediaté interest
without having special requirements levied.upon him and without
waiting for the next regularly scheduled meeting with his
Station contact. He has on numerous occasions notified: the
Station of the presence of suspect FPRRUMEM security types. He
has also frequently passed along operetional leads of use to

the Station in other aspects of its PSKUMEN operations. —

. 2. The addition of LI AL/DOG to the LIONION besenouse

has noticeably increased LIONICN-1's ability to identify new
visitors to the target and at times, determine the nature of
their btusinese. The LISAMPAN/DOG product was channeled to the
LIONION bssehouse by carrier currént from LISAMPAN/LISASH on

10 April 1968. Since its primary value is es an aid to LIONION-1
in identifying LIRING visitors, its product has not teen recorded

couoromise of the. LISASI! basehouse, linked directly to LIRIKG,
would not corpromise the LICLI0k basehouse which has no direct

link with the target.

3. Project LIONLON was of direct assistance to the Station
von two separate occasions in recent monthss

---a@, As a'result of information received on a priority
vasia (the same day as requested) from LKONION-1, the
Station was able to verify certain statements nade by
ESMARROW=1 concerning the locetion of LIAIKG officials at
specific times. LIONIOK-1 reported the times at which
these officials ceme in and out of tne LIKING compound and
provided a description of the clothes they vere weering at
the time. LIGNION-L‘'s information raised the possibility
that ESKAFROW-1 might at least tave been confused in his
reporting of the times at wrich he met LIPING personnel,

etc.

b. In March 1969, LIOVICi-1 was able to provide
pictures of three OLADY males, who, although unidentified,
fitted the general’ description and time frame furnished by

NERGO. The latter suspected that two or three WOLADY —
draft dodgers might visit LIRING to arrange trevel. to
- PBRUMEN. The Station was able to furnish LNERGO.with
pictures of the three together with a report of their
. arrival and departure from LIRING within three hours of
itg reyguest for informution. Additionul information wae
promptly forwarded to LNERGO es it tecame available from

LIONICH=1.

4. During tne past year, LidhIQi-l acted as a dispatcher
for the LISI#RACE surveillence tean on a number of occesioris.
By utilizing.his ventaze point in the area of the target, he is
atle to redio information to the LIEMEMACE tean on the arrival
and departure of LIRING officiels thus allowing the team to
regain at s distsrce from the target unseen hy possible, counter-—
surveillence from the target. The Station plens to use. LIONIOK-1
in this role mere extensively in the coming yeer wherever :
surveillance of LIRIN« personnel entails the team's presence
rear the LiRING compound. Such utilization of LIG.{Gi-1 should
lesser the risk of exposure of the team to the PHRUIT. IS.

sutmitting both operational and acministretive reports to the
, at a moments notice, to change personal
plans when a need fer his services arises. After five years
without a substential vacation, LIc? 1 slans a three week
trip from’4 - 25-hay to Europe (Itsly, Greece, France) and the
U.S.A. He originally requested five weeks to cake this trip
for which he has long ssved his toney, but quite willingly ~
‘shortened the trip to three weeks at the Stetion's request and

added that he would postpone the entire trir if the Station

‘thought his services were more needed at hoze. In order to

help defray the cost of making 4 second trip ta Surope to
complete his original itinerary, the Station will give LICNTOK-1

that consideration
will be given in 1970 to providing ean equal unt, but no
decision cun be made on that second gift until wid-1970.

The AMOTs have received and reviewed a number of the
prints from the LIONION operation and report that it
is a time-consuming and largoly unproductive effort,
The practical results of such a review, i.e., the
‘identification of the greatest number of visitors to
LIRING, can’be realized best through the widest cir-
culation of the: prints among the AMOT staffers, con-
tacts, and informants. This-practice would result
in wide knowledge of the existence of the operation, -
and in the expenditure of many-.man-hours which, it
appears, could be more productively spent in other

pursuits.

The AMOT organization currently does not have either
the qualified personnel or available space and equip-
ment to process the film as suggested in paragraph
three of reference. Until they move into new quarters,
inshopefully! mid-1968, the single AMOT photographer
will be working in very tight quarters. — .

2. It would appear from JMWAVE's expertence with AMOT exploitation

that further activity in this connection

of the LIONION operation,
at JMWAVE would be unwarranted. :

PROJECT LIONION RENEWAL REQUEST
A. Objectives:

1. Project LIONION is a long-term. support project designed
‘to provide fixed photographic, technical, and physical surveillance

‘of the PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The specific

objectives are:

a. “To ‘furnish photographic coverage during the
"day Light hours of the matn entrances to the target
installations.

b: To matntain in readiness a listening post to
support technical operations against. the targets.

¢. To xadio dispatch physical survelllance teams
against persons associated with the targets.

d. To provide for a mechanism which can fulfiltr
various miscellaneous PBRUMEN support requirements.

2. The above-cited objéctives are in agreement with the over~

all objectives of Station Mexico City.

B,. Changes:

In late January 1967 the operational and administrative
responsibilities for Project LIONION were transferred from Howard A,
TRECKLER to Cornelius L, PEUVION. No-agent handling, control, or
administrative problems were cncountered during the past year.

Cc. Intelligence Production:

As noted in Section A above, Project LIONION is an operational
support project and does not produce disseminable positive
intelligence. During the past year this project did provide over.
5000 individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering
or leaving the target installations, as well as approximately 8000
feet of pulse camera film. Information on the comings and goings
of target personnel and visitors to the installations, which
LIONION-1 provides in daily logs, has been incorporated into Station
files and on occasion made available to other stations or LNHARP
agencies, i.e., LNERGO. LIONION has been particularly useful in

- and Four

1. Approval is requested . to renew Project

LIONION for the period 1 January through 31 December
1967 at an annual expenditure of $11,666.00, including
$5,574.00 for FY 1967 and $6,092.00 for FY 1988. Wit .
Division programmed $12,000. 00° for this activity for
FY 1967 and funds are available, The Project cost
has been increased by $668.00 over the previous year,

sasioned by a small monthly raise for the Principal
Agent and a new provision for miscellaneous operational

expenditures,

2. Although this two-man Project does not
produce positive intelligence, it contributes. sub-
stantially and directly to the coverage of the Cuban
Embassy and Consulate in Mexico, producing photographs
in bulk of persunnel und visitors as well as intorma-
. tion on patterns of activity and personal associations,
““. and supporting recruitment attompts. It is contemplated
“that the Project will afford support to the extensive
technical penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LISAMPAN)
currently scheduled for installation in mid-January
. 1967, One of these penetrations is scheduled for the
Embassy gatehouse where visitors would normally,
- identify -themselves upon entering. Information from
“ thé .gatéhoise is to be. transmitted securely to the
“LIONION baseliouse as well as to the LISAMPAN listening
post. By collating this and other LISAMPAN intormation
with the photography, it is hoped to be able to identify
photographically many of the. visitors to the Embassy.

“ LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL

Ae Current Objectives :

There have béen no changes in tha objectives of the LIONION Project as
_ eet forth in the renewal request of last year. .

. TRECKLER has’ “gonimed the duties of Case Officer for LIONION since
the ‘departure. of Lawrence F,. BARKER in August 1966. TRECKLER is known to LIONION“L -
and: 2 as "Jose" or "Joe". TRECKLER meets with LIONION-1 at least once each - .
week end sees LIONION@2 only if he visita the LIONION basehouse, With the ~
departure of Hugh T,°PRANCOTTE (P) in August 1966, Walter W, CORNBURY (RP)
assumed. the duties of technical consultane for the project. CORNBURY is known
to LIONION“-1 and 2-as "Jack". LIONION“1 is being given a pay increase of :
$8.00 (U.§.) per month effective 1 January 1967, There are no other changes

conteaplated for the coming year.

C. Intelligence Production: :

The intelligence production is the same as that reported in the renewal
request for last year, It is difficult to estimate the intelligence value in
numbers of reports as there are so few positive reports made from this type of
production on the photographic end of the project. But this photographic
coverage is of inestimable operational intelligence valuc in coverage of the
PBRUMEN target. Should the LISAMPAN operation become active, part of LIONION’ a

. time will be used in support of that operation,

D,. Effectiveness:

‘The Station's eatimate of the value of. this project has not changed from
that expressed in the renewal request of last year. LIONION has further es=
tablished his importance to the Station's operational activitics by demonstrating
his ability co spot surveillance targets at LIRING from only a physical descrip-
tion provided by the Case Officer. If the planned LISAMPAN activity gets underway,
LIONION observations and insight into activities of LIRING will be increased

greatly, ;
The apartment spotted by LIONION~1 and obtained by the Station across from

LIRING that was mentioned in last year's renewal request is scheduled to be

utilized in the LISAMPAN operation, The location of LIONION<1 across from the

target and his background knovledge built up over the years are inValuable assets
to the Station's coverage of the primary target of the Related Mission Directive.

1.

SEGRET/KAPOX

POX:

E, ‘Problems: -

_ There were no major problems during the past year, One security problea

involved the claimed spotting of some of the photogrphic equipment from the

‘street by David’ M, WILSTED (PP), A thorough check of the basehouse by LIONION@1

id-the Case Officer failed to reveal any such equipment as being visible from

e street, However, additional security measures were takeo by darkening the

“the equipment through hanging of heavier drapes

walt, and putting up a portable screen behind

rves as a security check against the prying eyes

| s 8 LIONION@1 can now open the door fully to the room

when the servant pages him and she cannot see the equipment, The other problem

. 48 the. obtaining ‘of inmigrado..status for LIONION=2. This involves the deposit ing
of funds to a bank account and is discussed under paragraph I, :

F. Liaisons:
There is no lisison involved in the project.
Ge Interagency Coordination: : ~
Not applicable, —
H. Plans: ,
It is planned to have LIONIONS1 keep special logs on the activities of
selected targets in LIRING as he has done over the past year, With the case
_ officer handling LIONION-1 directly on a weekly basis, it is planned to continue
picking his brains for additional details on the LIRING target. Hope fully
LIONION@1 and 2 will be utilized for assistance in covering the proposed take
from the LISAMPAN operation, , . : :
I, Costs:
For Calendar Year 1966:
1. In the period 1 January through 30 June 1966, $4,500.00 was expended,
The projected expenditure for July 1966 through 31 December 1966 is $5,000.00,
This total project year expenditure is -approximately $1,000.00 under that
approved by Headquarters, However, this amount is probably due to having
drawn film and other supplies from overall Station- support without their
having been charged off againet the Project .

The total for FY 1967 is $11,666.00, Approval of this amount is requested,
Note that the salary figures include the salary raise for LIONION71 and the
usual one month pay Christmas bonus for LIONION@1 and 2, An additional
provision. has been made-for miscellaneous operational expenditures as there
may be-a recurrence of ‘same as in the past project year for which no provision
was made,’ Provision is being made for charging of funds for supplies to the
‘LEONION Project which was not done last yeac ia ocder that more accurate
.bookkeeping may be followed.

In addition, the Station has had to make a loan to LIONION"2 for gaining status |
‘to qualify for inmigrado-.status in Mexico, This loan is held in a savings
‘account in a Mexican bank to prove to the Mexican authorities that LIONION=2
can support herself, Funds are withdrawn from this account moathly, sometimes

LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL

1

A. Current Objectives: This Project is a technical, currently
- primarily photographic, surveillance operation against the Cuban’
Embassy and Consulate ‘in Mexico City. Its original objectives,
still current, include furnishing photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the Embassy and Consulate entrances; furnishing
.& control point for. dispatching physical surveillance teams
against persons associated With the target; and furnishing
a listening post (LP) in readiness to monitor and record
~ technical audio penetrations of the target. Two new cbjectives
added during the Project year include assisting Station Mexico
_ City to build up individual dossiers on target offictals; and
affording an observation post for Station activities involving
direct contact with the target. These new objectives are in
consonance with Priority A, Objective 1 of the current Related
Mission Directive for Station Mexico City. .

’B. Changes: There have been no changes in personnel and none
are contemplated during the coming year. Meadquarters is
assuming the task of developing some of the film exposed

under this Project, LIONION-1's pay was increased $40 per
month effective 15 March 1965, :

C. Intelligence Production; The Project is not designed to
produce disseminable information, It produced thousands of
‘excellent photographs during the year which were shared with
Headquarters and Station JMWAVE, Information on the comings
and goings of target personnel and visitors to the target have
been incorporated into many Station files, principally. the
dossier files. No precise statistics are available, but at
least 100 exposures are made daily during target working hours,

D. Effectiveness: The Project is considered highly successful
‘and essential by fhe Staton, In addition to the excellent photo-~
graphic coverage provided, LIONION-1, the Principal Agent, has
developed into a first-class asset for other operational duties.
The Project Basehouse was essential to mounting and monitoring
the Station's attempt at recruitment and subscquent harassment
of a sensitive target employee, The Case Officer in charge of
the attempt sat with LIONION~1l for several weeks observing the
“movement pattern of the target employee. LIONION~1 manned one
ot the radio dispatch posts used to control the physical
surveillance of the target employee while near the Baschouse.

Sehouse and LIONION-1's expert knowledge of the”

have been mounted: The operation itself. was an attempt to
satisfy the tOp priority requirement laid-on Station Mexico Cit y
iby Headquarters, “It is expected that future similar. operations

‘will depend to’a large extent on the facilities provided by

“this Project.

- Another very effective performance by LIONION-] was his
obtaining, by sharp observation and quick, intelligent and
secure action, an apartment ina building directly across
the street from the target. The Station had been seeking
an apartment in this building for many years.

E.. Problems: The only problem currently besetting the Project
is the excessive work load on the Principal Agent. To alleviate
this, Headquarters is assuming the task of developing some of
the film produced by the Project.

Cover for LIONION-1 has ceased to be a problem. He has
received his permanent immigrant status and now has a goed deal
of immunity from harassment from Mexican immigration authorities,
He was able to get his translator cover backstopped directly
cut of the Office of. the President of Mexico and thus has a
strong protective security factor built into it, a

F. Liaison: The Project has no liaison connection. LIONION-1's
cover backStop with the Office of the President of Mexico is non-
operational, . . :

G. Interagency Coordination: Not applicable,

H, Plans: It is planned to make better use of LIONION-1l's
observations and operational logbooks during theooming year
rather than to.settle for his excellent photographs alone,

‘It has been found that he can often supply valuable additional
information because of his "feel" for those Persons who are
under constant observation from the Basehouse., He can- read
Significance into activity which might go unnoticed or be
misinterpreted by observers with less experience. He will

MEMORANDUM FOR: mee
SUBJECT “3° LIONION Project

- 1, LIONION is a new project which is submitted in the
amount of $10,478. This is a photographic surveillance opera-
2 “" tion targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Two
nn “agents are involved; LIONION-1t, a young Cuban lawyer: in exile,
va, . and LIONION-2, his mother. The Agents act as observers and
7 : photographers, LIONION-1 is also used as a dispatcher for the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team, from which he is compartmented,
“to cover individuals associated with this target. These agents
“. were previously used in connection with the unilateral tele-
phone tap operation* against the Cuban Embassy. The current
photographic operation began in the latter part of 1962,
and was previously. funded under Cuban FI funds. The operation
has provided’ valuable data tor the identification of Cuban
.- Embassy personnel and visitors, and on their patterns of .
action and personal associations. . : ‘

2. The security of this operation, particularly the
agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements,
appear reasonably sound. Both agents know that they are
working for AIS, and LIONION-1 was successfully FLUTTERED
in October 1963, However, LITAMIL-=7 and LITAMIL-9, who are’
penctrations of the Cuban Embassy, are aware of this
activity, as they are used to help identify individuals
Photographed, :

3. Approval for the LIONION Project is recommended.

It is requested that, in order to assist Headquarters!
evaluation, project reporting include details of CI/CE data
furnished, and examples of leads developed from such information,
