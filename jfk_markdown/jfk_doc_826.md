fl 1. AMLASH/1 was instructed in S/w techniques by the under-

: signed in a Paris Station safehouse on 17 and 18 August, and was !
: given an S/d review in the final triefing session held in the hotel
i Yoom of Wallace A. Growery (Madrid Station C/O) on 22 August.

: Instruction was given in the use of carbon writing system No. 15136
1 and in the use of liquid developer system No. 56638. The "scorch"

i method of development was also demustrated to A/l as an alternate

system. A total of five hours was devoted to this instruction.

2. A/1, who was recruited a short time prior to coming to
Paris, was introduced to the idea of using S/w by the undersigned
during discussions held in Copenhagen. Although for security
considerations, he was skeptical at first about using such a means
of communication, he was without wadue effort convinced that any ’.
productive relationship depended upon his being able to communicate
with his C/O ona regular basis through. the medium of S/W letters
sent through normal mail channels. It was apparent from his early
questions that he was unfamiliar with the principles of S/@ and clandes-
tine communications in general. after further talks in Paris with
Growery on 26 August, 4/2) was fully prepared to aecept the conceot
of S/a commuications,, and arrangezents were made for this instruction : . 3
to begin the following day. .

3. The first training session on 17 August lasted a little
more than two hours, and was devoted to an explanation of the S/W i
system of commnication, including careful instruction in the :
preparation of a letter containing S/¥. A/1 also prepared an S/W
letter of his own under the Supervision of the undersigned. He
seemed to grasp readily the principles of the preparation of an S/w

message and experienced only a little difficulty at first in remember-
ing all the steps in sequence necessary for the preparation of an S/W
Message. He was generally attentive to the instruction given. How-
ever, in keeping with his temperment, he was a little impatient

during the preparation of the S/w message itself upon the cover

letter. At the end of this session, he demonstrated that he remembered
the basic steps in a satisfactory mamner, particularly considering

that it wae his first day in S/W instruction. :

4. The second period of instruction took place in the same
safehouse, lasting about two hours. This session was devoted toa
review of the S/W procedures and the preparation by A/l of another
practice S/W letter. Following this, Af. was instructed in the
development of S/W messages, using the liquid developer No. 56538
The scorch system of develonzent was also demonstrated. A/1 was
impressed by the simplicity of the liquid developer and the immediate
reaction which it produced. The undersigned developed one message;
then 4/1 was allowed to prepare the developer from its dry pill form
and to develop a second practice s/w message for himself. Following
the pericd devoted to S/W development, a general review of S/W
communications was held, the basic points apparently being well-fixed
in A/1's mind.

5. During the final formal meeting with A/1 un 22 August

with Growery and the undersigned participating, the latter gave A/1

@ general review of all the S/s procedures which were to be used

it his contact with KUBARK. He also was provided with the following
tems: :

A. Two sheets of S/W carbon paper f No. 338)

B. Forty-seven pills of developer ( No. 56638

C. One tablet of writing paper provided by TSD and
known to be compatible with the carbon sheets.

D. 3 No. 2 pencils of French manufacture.

E. One ball-psint pen with water-resistant ink.

F. Two accomodation addresses: one in Madrid for
regular contact; one in New York City for rapid
emergency contact (see attached S/w data sheet).

G. Appropriate indicators (see S/W data sheet)

It is noted that 4/1 did not have a secure accomodation address in
PBRUMEN to give us at this time. He was told, however, that it was
imperative that he provide one for us by S/W letter within two weeks
of hie return to PBRUMEN. This he stated he would do.

6. During the last S/w review, A/1 was shown a photograph
of one of his practice messages which he had prepared. He was quite
interested in seeing this, which served to illustrate a number of the
training points which had been covered during previous instruction.

Generally, A/1 was an interested pupil and it is believed that he
will be able to carry out the instructions in a proper manner. He
is quite security conscious, a factor which it is believed, will add
to his attempts to seek perfection in his S/¥ correspondence and

in the secure storage of his S/W materials when not in use. It is
also knom that A/l practiced his S/ techniques in his hotel room
after leaving the 22 August meeting. This is known because he had
an additional question to ask us at a brief meeting on 23 August.

7. It should also be noted that the TSD technician who
developed A/1's practice letters recommends that for best results,
all letters from A/1 be subjected to ammonia fuming before immersion

in the developer.
