SUBJECT; °- Project pute

: With reference’ to oy conversation with Mr. Baker concern-
ing” tke> Project outline covering the subject project, I have approved
thie project aubject to the following condition. It makes no sense
ould etate In paragraph 6 under the heading of security
cable: -Teasures will be taken to disguise the official
.: financia and othervise; and at the same ‘tine -to pro-

. active 3 Sponsors “will de Mr. Melvin J. Lasky,

. overt - “EI COG monthly: “magaztne "Der Monat.". I underotand™
that Mr. Lasky ia needed as one of the principa] organizers and opera-
tives but I think it quite unnecessary for Hie name to be flourished

_ ebcut asa Sponsor. After all, he ia officially employed by HICOG--
he is, therefore, an ‘acknowledged memer of the U. S. apraratuo in .

Gérmany. Why then should his ‘name be used? Reuter 1s an excellent

" sponsor and surely it will be-possible to find one or more others--

_Mon-Aserican or at least. no fal amet Lean--to_ ‘Serve as Sponsora,

uot _ 2. Generally in the same ; connection I asmime that our con- .
~ ‘eultaat, Mr. Burnha®, will operate 1n the wings and that hie nace '
will not be too prozinently diepleyed. As the reault of his recent

.° doo and. the furer of communist commentary, he ie a "sitting duck?
- for hostile propaganda in my opinion. I am entirely in favor of his”
participating extensively in the arrangements, but the more hia par-..
ticipation can te in the form of "off-stage shispers" the better. | 7

‘Te decision on this is not up to me.. I will ap;reciate
opportunity to discuss it yith you. . oO

My point of view ia that ALL of this current PRXUICK atuft
is. premature and a case of va lot .of: hungry aoctora srelling
easy money and wanting to- got ‘into the aot and get tho ‘show én - :
the road. an . . .
We have no agot for PDQUICK for. this period - and Ufterally,

; are living on borrowed funds. ‘je, oan't make up a budget. bdcause.
we have no socounting fron ‘fLeld, do not know where we. stang. | ~~

Here are “some ‘othor quéstions ant ny ‘minds ‘

: What wore the publicity scooupltahnonts of the relatively
expansive NY office?.

What happened to the berlin news overage by. US correspondents?

; ~ What -happoned to the bright and sanguinary “forecasto. cf

tremenéous amounts of publicity, speoial magazine articles. radio
roadcasts, ete, which wre to emanate from the attendance at the . mo
ongzess of Messrs, Montgomery and Conant - a little: natter . Coe
which cost the US about two thousand piecoa of Bituce 7 (It seems

(okear that their attendancs was absolutely worthless othern50.)

’ What happoned to their efforts to obtain delegates fron
‘the Middle East? :

' Why did Lasky proceed with a dozen last mime. Invitations
cr $0 Annocnous persons (these were supposed to be ta few! and to:
‘ extrenely. important people) dnoluding'' several wives.

A ‘“dadlegram wea sent urging that a press Sonférence: be arranged | soe

.... There were no: photographs. of the pool displays’; mie. book: . 5 .
aispley was an axpensive item, © bid tt take. place? _ -

Now with 4 Ll, these questions in my ‘mind, adding, up to a.
realisation that 4f the Congress wes a success, it was only a.
_ gmocess as far as it wont, and it has a long way to 50 to completely
---- §uatify itself < the next 's ore NOT beitig spending a lot’ of dough for

‘but in getting a distribution. of € million pisces of. literature, and ~
- other publioity, in Satellite arsas - I would hesitate (which is °
- a euphemism for Dlankly object) to blandly appropriating an extra
ten thousand bucks to support an innocuous group of Russian exiles who
. want to air their grievances, NOT under our control.

port, frea reliable and competent observer at the Serlin Congress”
which am. quoting below: .

"on ‘the wholé, the Congress has achieved some useful results. .
In ay opinion, the teat thing about the Congress was that it vao

otner place would have had neither the enng political oigsificance

the fact that Berlin wao chosen as tha meeting place waco reneved
proof of Weotern ‘solidarity vith their resistance ngainst the
Rusojans. They nosd- such procf agaln and agdin, especially ia
view of the fact that they have a definite and justified impression
that the Bonn Government te not inclined to manifest any particular

_ At & cortain zoment, the detates tock a very unfortumte

turn. On‘one of the f-equent occasions, when Foestler vae given
the floor, he read s. mper vherein he attacked Socialien in
gonersl (and the Frittoh Labor Government in particular. Considoring
1) that | about 70% of tho delegates were poople who professed
socialist -opinione; 2) that tho purpose of the Congrese roquired
that a unity of all denocratic intellectuals, doth socialists and
Hon-eocinliets in the struggle against totalitarianisn be euphasised
and 3) that tha chairsan of the Congrens sas “met Reuter, head of
the social -denocratic city government of derlin -- Koestlor's attack
was absolutely out of place and sho:Jd not have been made regardless
of. whether he waa right or not. Aga matter of fact, the paper in
question pr ved- that Xoestlor is mistaken th (aasuming that a brilliant
journalist and a saccesoful novelist 18 a9 ipeg qualified to play the
role of a philosopter, bfstorian and sociologist. In addition,
nigtaken statements by British Labor régarding the problem of

a Yuropean unity do not frotify in my opinion the kind of vitriolic
all-out attack. against the 3ritish Labor Government which was msde
by Koeotler who. seena to have forgotten, that, regardless, what one

~ccyoomay think of sone of its policies, British Laber is today one of the ~~

principal pillars of*the world democtati¢ front.

: ‘Pyidently Keestlar's attack crovoked tmrediate reaction on the
part! of the Socialist Congress delegstaa, beginning with Reuter who |
was fn the chair, ‘In my opinion, this entire discussion was complately
unnecessary. The British conservative HN. P., Arery, showed mach
better judgment than Koestler by etadfadly avoiding in hie pronounce-
ments, any criticisa of the Labor Government. If an attitude sintlar
to that of Xoestler would have been adopted in the trade union field,
the I.C.F.7.U. could not have been created. As in the labor movenent,

_ the organitation of intellectuals for the defense of democracy cannot
be auecesafel unlese it to understood that decocratic socialitem ie a
rover fal tufiuenca asong the. best intellectuals of Europe and Asia

"and that, therefore, everything should be done. te secure cooperation |
of all democratic forces in erite of sll ideological differences. I
was rather astonished. to find that Irving scomed to. like Koostler's
discouree on accilaliaz. ‘I spoke “with: quite a nuzber of dologates and

fouhd that they dida't Like “At at all.

*Tratead of appointing on the. first ani second days of tho Congress

on any draft ‘resolutions, proposals and suggestions made by the
- delogates, a draft manifesto and draft résolution vere subzitted to ea
plenary meeting vhich had to decide on thea within.a few hours, That
meeting appointed some cornittees who had exactly one hour's tine to
amend the resolutions. Of ¢ourse, to ‘serious work of re-writing and...
completing the resolutions could be done ander such circumstances,
You will notice that the sanifesto treats tho question of cultural
freedom principally from tho point of view of the Journalist and less:
from that of the scholar and the artiotd. At leaat thie ie my. opinion.

\__The underaigned callod upon Professor Hook at his hous, 696-A Third
| , Sereet, Brooklyn 15, #. ¥., at 3:00 ofclock on April 22,1950 to discuss |
- | ‘domestic arréayenonts:in support of the Congress, for which Frofesoor Hock
: bse been deeignated fxariean ropresentativo, There vere no other persons
-._, Professor Houk opened the conmveraation ty exphasiaing the nead to
einicdso the Governmnt's interest in the Congress. He folt that it vas -
essential to retain tho ap;carance. of a completely private venture. I
 essured hig this wae elso the Department's view. Referring to tho etatua |
of Walvin J. Lasky, secretary of tha Congress in Perlin, aa an exployee. :
of HICOG, Profozsor Hook then eaid he thought tr. Lasky showld bs given: |
@ lsavé of absonco in order to carry through. tha project in-a private.
capacity. I promised to look into thia problos, and coumented that it.
could not be done readily without Mtr, Lasky's cooperation, i also :
_ Suggested that ainco Er, Lasky to oy knowledge wee spending como of his .
' persensl funds on prepuratione for. the Congress, it would only ba fair -

Gm contiming the discussion, it waa elear that in working elone
Professor Hook had as yet beer smile to neke eny ccnsiderahle Progress
on behel? cf the Congres, and that there tas urgent seed for (a) a
Binium staff to bindle the progres in thig country and (b) a exall

“-alioeetion cf funds to per for talgphone, stationery, publicity, ete,

and apparertly bas hed to be extrenely careful
Hetanea telerhcne calle, For example, he felt
telescor. Jokn Dewey in Florida and ask hin

ite toil ‘charge was quite: beyond

hie zeang. . , ae an mo.
__ In-reply ‘to: wy"quary ac to etat sort of idget wotld be nscetsary,

Professar Hook sugzésted that 32 eoclé needa secretary-typiat for tuo . mo

months aed a public relations ‘gaa ‘on a part-tite basis for the gaze period, .

-- Be. thonght the secretary could te ob-eined for $250 a month and the pub--

“Uelty min’ fer less than $500, In-eéiition, $500 vould be sufficient for -
such itess as rertal of typewriters, stationery, telephone calla; postage,
ete. This would inke a total baiget of £2,000, The rental expense could ~
be reducet, he thought, ty using the offices of The Ney Leader, a Socialist
publieation-of whlch ha is.one ef the editors. fle did not think it adviae~
able to hava-a pretentious office, since obvious affluence would incite _
suspicien, The setivity cozid be organized-by snericana for Intellectual
Freedom, of which he ia the founter. This group staged the.anti-Comnmist

* program in How York in March: 19 fer.isss than 225,00,

Ad to.the expenses of Ansrieas reprocontativea going to Berlin, .

: -Proféssor. Fook hoped that it ‘wociz rot be neceseary to use military trans
. portation, sines that vould ereate the ispression of Govornment spongor- -

ship. He tho:ght commercial trazspertetion would definitely be preferable, :
and added that he would like to ts ina position to give cash grants to

the delegates cf about $706, that is, the romd-trip ‘fare plus a few. dollars
over for incidentals, He felt it: would bo unissirable for too large an 2

American representation to be aszt. Frotably .2ix or seven people veuld: be Tk
bo enough. This would mean a treseporteticn badget of less than -$ 500077 . wwe?

Severdi tings during the coxvereation, Profeecor Lacky stressed that
he sald, tho right reople cold tard; te paid; {t was essential, he said,
to have “dedicated personnel® gho were willing if necessary to make -per-
sem) sacrifices. - . ° ere Es

a On the other hand, he thougkt it vitel to-have the right. sort ef
publicity. Yhe preas arrangerents ebould to carefully mde. He hoped
that someone 1 aashington could ask Br. fonry Luca of Tine end Life
‘and Er, A. B, Sulsberger of the. Bev York Times to errerge the right sort .

of the Mes. He would like to invite lise himself, but doubted if it :
would be politically desirable. At this point, I suggested inviticg .

Brs. Glare Booth Luco, and Professor Hook thought thot aight be the ansuer
to his dilemm. 0 _O “eee,

: fo-handlé the publicity Professor Hook thought he might hire”
_ Arnold Betehnan.(20 Kost Eith Street, Ker York), who is editor of a
trede uniod paper in Rew York. Boickman bandled press matters succese=
fully for the anti-Commi et. denorstretion last March. Frofessor Hook-

they would seize the Western Eerlin government and restore ‘the city to

a unified, peaceful capital of Germany. The peaceful declarations. have ~
stated that the demonstration of 599,900 toys and girls (from all over ~
Germany, and froa other countries) will chiefly take place in Eastera ©
Rerlin and will consist of rally-carching; sports evects, fireworks, and

rationalizing his contacts, Therefore, I shall prepare tho
