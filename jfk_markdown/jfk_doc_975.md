Memo to Mr. Belmont SEE a] Re: Central Intelligence Agency
: Information Received from James
Angleton

-Intelligence @ivision. Angleton handles special cases of a various
nature and he is usually given considerable freedom and leeway in
directing the operations of his_unit. In general, he is responsible
only to the Director of CIA. e has numerous foreign sources and
channels for developing infor ton. The primary source is the[Tsraeli
Intelligence Service.§S\In addition to this, he is tn contact with
5\/Jay Lovestone who pértodically makes available to Angleton copies
reports which Lovestone} has received from Anerican Federation of (8) g)
Labor} representa tves throughout the world. “Phese representatives)
are @ssociated with the Free .Trade Union Committee, which is cud. ©
sidized by the CIA. Angleton also has indépendent sources in the
intelligence services of France, Italy, Greece, and Great Britain.
On occasion he utilizes sources in the Vatican. Some of the men
under his control are on various foreign assignments in Europe and
are responsible only to him. Most of them are traveling under.
- commercial cover.

During the past several months Angleton has been very
cooperative with the Bureau. He has volunteered voluminous infor-
mation of interest to the Bureau and he has followed Bureau leads
tn an effective manner. Much of the information which Angleton
has furnished appears in the raw form, that is, it consists of the
actual reports received from Angleton's sources. This has been of
advantage because the Bureau has been in a position to better evaluate
the information instead of waiting for the delay and processing through
normal channels in the CIA. In addition to information regarding
Security matters furnished by Angleton, he has also been of valuable
assistance by keeping the Liaison Agent apprised of administrative
changes and reorganization within the CIA. Angleton is thoroughly \
informed regarding the foreign intelligence activities of his agency
and he frequently clarifies matters which the CIA_sometimes camouflages
with some of its cloak and dagger techniques. ty u)

For your information, Angleton was instructed by General.
Walter Bedell Smith, while he was still Director of the CIA, [to u)
cooperate fully with the Liaison Agent and was told that he,
Angleton, could disseminate any information he saw fits] This policy
has continued under Allen Dulles.

Since the volume of information received from Angleton U

has increased the Liaison Agent has endeavored to encourage Angleton
to establish some uniformity in the dissemination of information to

Meno to Mr. Belmont

recetves from{the Israelt Intelligence Service .jtjAngleton is now
furnishing th tatison Agent blank memoranda which are dated,
captioned, and which carry a control number; for example, "SP=1."
This number will serve as a@ ready reference when some question
comes up withtn the Bureau or the CIA. The Liaison Agent will make
an appropriate notation on each memorandum indicating that the
documents emanate from Angleton. It is believed advisable to set
up @ control file containing a copy of each document furnished by
Angleton. This can be done in a manner simtlar to the arrangement
effected in handling reports received fron[ Stott] (S)

the Bureau, particularly with regard to that SB anciete which he

‘In view of the above, ‘Angleton more or less falls into

, the category of a Confidential Informant. He furnishes information

of a sensitive nature and it is, therefore, believed that when
disseminating his data, he should be protected as a source. Up to
date Supervisors have been ‘handling this information in a secure
manner; however, since the volume of data received from Angléton
has increased, it is believed desirable to alert all Section Chiefs
regarding the handling of information received from Angleton. (RU)
