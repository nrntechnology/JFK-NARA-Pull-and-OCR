adn't think this area for the ce wa. already "tlown? due to the number of ©

besides ALMUNel and A RUNGL1,) AYEUNG-1 stated he was not sure, lut vould

that this sup.ort «ill be step cd up as our infiltraticn capabilities are ine
creased both by air and sea. In parting, he csuticned aviHUxG-1 not to take
any unnecess «ry chances when he resumed operaticnal activities in Cuba, since
his lesdershiy in the ANYUM group was vital to our overall interests. The

5. Sore of the more significant hi, hlirhts of the conv-rsaticns hich -
tock place betwen AYAUNG=1 and the undersiyned prior to his weetings with the
W/T operator (Francisco) and Jitezeral are noted herewith:

a. Security: Castro wg tuken stringent acti n in tirhtening up
his internal security a, ainst counterer:voluticnary forces inside
Cuba. The raiitia arr being usec to search heus-s for concesled
weapons (usually by a hlock system), and anyone failing to produce
proper identification ic removed for questicning by the NiER.
Hence, ANAUNC-1 ani his organizati.. are largely ccnfining their
aCtivities to the daylizht hours from C700 to 2000 haurs. He
considers night operaticns - particularly cn the st:ects of Ravana -
as highly dangerous inasmuch as the Di: (security orrans) are -
ecnstantly on the alert to stop individuals cn the street to check
their identification dccuments.

bs Documentati:n of Avents in Cuba: AYAUNG-1 surgested using an
identiricati-n card issued by the Havana University for their

students. He had a sarple copy in his ;ossession, which he cleins- O

was readily accepted by Castro security, forces as being valid.

Sirdlarly, 3 driver's license procerly authenicated along with a —
health certiricate were considorec to ba gocd Ycover® docurents —_
for a,ents cperating in the Havana area. A sup; sly of blank identi-

agents whe can be passed off es students at the Ravana University.
(He sugested preparing cae for tis w/T o;erator (Francisco).

©. Operaticnal Expenditures: CQue:ied on this aspect, *SCNG-1 stated
his organizati n-»culd need a minimum of 50 to 60,N0 pesos a
month to cover their overall operaticnal expenses. These funds are
being used for safehouse raintenance, travel expenses, purchase of
vehicles and gascline, ailoraticn of funds to vericus sub- :
divisions of the AMYUM organizaticn located in varicus provinces of
Cuba, and purchase of food and support of various arents whose
families may be in dire need of food and medical surrlies.

da. w/t O,erators: To date, both AvPANICs14 and AYCIEX~2) have net
mot the requirements for effective coraunica! ion with us on AYYUF ©

operat.cns. However, AFAUNG-1 feels that AYPANICw2% has not been
compromised or turned by the DIDx and once he rets over his nervous
state, it is possible he can stil] be used, Similariy, although -
AYGLEN-1 ds considered to ba a co d W/T cjerator, AYXNGs) fecls
: his usefulnoss to hie has been considerably nejatet by the nature
: of his assignment at the Naval bese end his recent restrictions
, to this base by orders of the Castro regire. In stort, AYRUNG-L
feels com-unicaticn is the weakest link in his currest epera’
and that direct com-unicati:ns with the Embsazsy is growing ine!
eroasingly hazardous, due to the fact that Embassy rerscnnel cre
under close survedllance by the Castre cecurity forces. For this
reason he feels that Francisco wil) fill a sericus wid in this
respect, once he is infiltrated into the AMYUK orgarasation in

Cuba.

e. Support for other anti-Castro gro: ps in Cuba: AYSTMe2 stated that
all materiel suport srculd bo funneled directly te his organiza.

i his view this would sorve as a ccntrol factor in-unifying the over.
1 all effort of the varicus spiinter ,roups seeking svct suppcrt in -
i Cuba and ould also entsnce the pfestice of the MRE ss the spesr
: head for the FRINTS,. He then went on to acd that he was fully —
: aware of our efforts to supsort other groups in Cuba, which he ©
: aosumed ve were operating wath on @ unilateral basis. (i.e, he
1 sited Nino Diag in Oriente). AMWNCG~l felt this wis a serious —
! mistake, as this unilateral suport would affect the leadership and
directicn now being provided by the MAR Shroughout Cub. . The,
undersigned told AvalXG-) that he arpreed on the desirability of
H &@ cocrdinate d effort on the part of all counter-revolut: onary
groups seeking to overthrow Castro using the FRENTE as the rally. - :
ing center. However, tie question of sup-ort deing:étee ted -
through one channel namely: his organization in Cué, was neither
feasible nor practical. The feet that Castro had tightened up
security throughout the varicus previnces of Cuba, 2 make it
difficult or possible for the AMYUM greup te ship ares and other
equipsent from Havana te the eastern ost provinces (t.e., Las

H Villas, Casaguay of Oriente) without jeopardizing both shiprents

! and person el. Hence, the need for unilateral action on our

! part to sup.ay those fighting groups in these provinces. This
explanaticn appeared te satisfy AYEUNG-1, however he still insisted
that his organizatt n should at least be appraised of any rateriel

support provided other groups in Cuba. He was sesured that wa
would take Lis request under consideraticn.

f. abRLDP¥-11 AYKUNG.1 feels that nc useful purzose would be served
in sending his a:stciaty to join forces with him in Havana. He
feels that ArBIDDY-1 should continue te represent the AYYUM
facticn in the FAD and when the counter-r: volutivr-ry forces are
fully prepared to everthrow the Castro reg-re, aPf2INTY-1 will be
brought into the Pinar del Rio to direct the AYYUY forces in this

province.

g@- BKanclo Ray: AbalNG-1 considers RAY as a hipnly dan-erous individual
because of his great ambiticn to play a prerinent role in any
subsoquent Cuban gov: rnsent following the overthrow of the Castro
regine. In his opinion, RAY poses a soricus threat to VAHCNA*s
leadership and the FRD inside Cuba. Ho is attempting to draw .
various dissident groups to hie banners 2nd appeurs to have support -"--
from the riddle class represented by business intercats, politiciats,
and the professicnal class. Should iY te persuaded to join
forces wath the FKD, AXUNG-1 thinks he wi:l cortirnue to operate
on & unilateral basis while geeking to supercede the FRD with ©
his om crganizaticn in Cuba. .

h. Tony Varona_and the FRD: Although AFRUNG-1 reccgnizes the neod
to support the FRD as a political front for rallying counter-
revolutionary grou,s against the Castro regive, he n netheless
feels that the FHENIE and Tony ViKCNA hove lost eensiderable face
dn Cuba by inaction and political maneuv~ rings He further pointed
out that he 4a avare that thousands of dollars rad been poured into
the FRraTz, but dissident groups in Cuba hve s<en no evidence of
any of this money to sup ort their efforts to cverthrow Castro. —
Hence, ccnfidence in the F!D is at a relatively low ebb amcny the
people in Cuba and a new shot in the arm in the form of materiel
and financial support is needed to restora this confidences- Ace
conding to “FiUNG-1 vhie eup. ort must be forti.coming soon because
such peo;le as Manolo RaY ere taidng the initistive and will socn
contrcl the entirc counter-revolut onary movement in Cuba,
