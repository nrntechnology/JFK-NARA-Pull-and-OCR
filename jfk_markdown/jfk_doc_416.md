_ SUBJECT: Howard Hunt

determined that $33,500 was advanced. to hin.
for-travel and transportation of household
goods to and from Madrid with one trip to
Paris for. he and. his family to renew their
Spanish visas. All of this advance was fully
. accounted for.._However, in his accounting,
one item appeared unusual. It was an :
expenditure of $1,600. for a-sensitive | .
opération which was approved for write-off :by Mr. ~
Joo... . Desmond’ Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without 7
Te, further ‘accounting. . soe

3. Also, we confirmed. that no other Agency advance accounts

were established for Mr. Hunt during this. period.

: 4. At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name. The
EUR Division accordingly, requested we’ open an account at ‘the
Chase, Manhattan’ Bank in Mr. Hunt's name. to receive all non- —
-salary payments (Mr. Hunt “had an“account at Riggs National -
Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The -

following: deposits were made to the account during 1965. and”

5. We feel at this time without specific- guidelines that,
further searching would be-sonewhat’fruitless.. One strange © i
aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that i
; all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the :
2 -EUR Division which is.not normal as non-official cover people
- are usually assigned to a project. It is unusual to have a

(by which he: fixed:the time), and took over the Iberian desk, Bill
Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the. time). In early autumn’
“Ryan said that he had just been-informed by the DDP (Karamessines)
that Hunt was to be assigned to Madrid as DCOS, as a directed assign-

“ment by Helms, A memo was prepared and sent to. the COS, Jim Noel
~ (now retired).: There.was.nothing further for about a month when Ryan’
called Coleman in and. showed hin a RYBAT letter from Noel stating. —
that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the

Embassy.

3. Woodward-had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt
was COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting
the days until Hunt left.:: The President of Uruguay ‘visited President.
Eisenhower in the;States, at which time he requested a personal favor--_ -
that Hunt be ‘reassigned to Montevideo, - So Hunt took another tour. ,
Woodward was outraged, and had his revengé ‘in n 1964 when. Hunt was -

in and, observing that ‘there was more than one way to skin a cat,
atold him that Hunt was going to Spain: under nonofficial cover... This |
didn't require anything special, Ryan saying’ that he, didn't. know , -

o much about it.” It came to,him from Karamessines.on Helms! order, .

nothing for the station. Hunt was ‘to submit administrative’ vouchers’ : ih

Ryan said he could talk-to Karamessines- i€ he Wished, Because ~~

Coleman.-had a-close personal. association with Karamessines he:

did just that, He was told by Karamessines that he didn't know much

Ambassador Woodward was also present. At the time he asked
about Hunt, Woodward said it might still be dragged into the. press.
Tad Szule had been after Woodward-about the Hunt assignment td
Spain. Coleman observed that Szule did have a long article on Hunt
in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,

with Me. Hunt while at the Mullen Company on a contiauing
. basis, because Mr. O'Malley was interested in Nr. Puat
~-—-~->-~ for possible referwsal of other‘Ayency retirees. Nr.
O'Malley also understood that there was Cover and Cons
“mercial Steff interest in the Mullen Conpany, and that
Nr. Hunt: became instrumental in discussing several aspects
of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of
the company. Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various
Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance: when these -indi-
-viduals expressed an interest in ‘entering the pudlic

requesting referral of retiring Agency employees with’
specific qualifications. These instances occurred apparent-
ly after Mr. Hunt had assumed his responsibilities with
the White House. In one instance Mr. Hunt requested re-
ferral of a recently retired Agency secretary. As in
previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Mailey was unable
to. recall the name of this. individual. He. did, -however, -
state that he is quite certain Mr. Hunt turned down the:
individual whom he referred: .As a point of clarification,
Nv. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously
been known to Mr. Hunt, nor had she previously worked —
for him in any capacity. Mr. O'Malley. also recalled a .-
request from Mr. Hunt for an individual having skilis in
the area of locks’ and surreptitious entry. A resume of
Mr. Thomas €. Amato was provided to Mr. Hunt at that time.

O'Malley recalled that Mr. Hunt expre
with that suggestion in part because o Huat :
Viowed as that firm's politicat orieatctian. Mr. O'Malley
did not elaborate further oa that remark. Mr. O'Malley
then suggested the use of Anderson Security Consultants,

oS

Incorporated, a commercial cover entity of the Office of

"> Security. Mr. O'Malley stated that insofar as this’

organization was advertised in the yellow pages and that
Mr. Huat could be assured of the reliability of the ser-
vices, he felt this to be a reasonable suggestion. Mr.

O'Malley stated that during a subsequent phone call when
Kr. O'Malley asked how his sugsestion had worked out, ¢
ur. Hunt. responded, "Yes, they had done a fine job."

“At this point. Mr. O'Malley was asked whether or not fron

his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt Nr. Hunt was in
the habit of making glib comnents which were not neces-
sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr;
O'Malley stated that. this was categorically so. He said '

_he was sure that Mr. Hunt had lied to hin on a number of .

occasions and that,therefore, he was in no position to

-be sure that Mr. Hunt had actually, in fact, uscd. the

services of Anderson Security Consultants. Mr. O'Malley __
volunteered the inion that he suspected the electronic

of the Committés to Re-elect the President... -

7. In response to a question 2s to whether he had

; ever referred anyone to McCord Associates, Mr. O'Malley
replied that he remembered having referred Walter Brayden.

Nr. Brayden for a time acted asbodyguard to Mrs. Martha

"Mitchell. As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned that Mr.
‘Brayden had refused to carry a fireara in Spite of the -

fact that Mr. McCord told him he could do so on the author-

ity of the Attorney General. Asked specifically if he had - .

ever referred either Willian Shea or Teresa Shea to Mr.. .

-in coordinating funding for the covert action activities
Of Mr. E. Howard Huat, the issue was raised as to whether
Or not the funding of Mr. Hunt's projects continued beiveen
July 1965 awd September 1964 while Nr. Haat was a contract
cnaployee stationed at Madrid, Spain. Nr. O'Malley recalled
that at the tine of Mr. Hunt's signment.to Madrid the
statement disseminated for. consumption within the Ageacy
was that Mr. Hunt was retiring. Mr. O'Malley stated that.”
this was not génerally believed. Mr. O'Malley was quite:
certain that duzing this period his office handled no’
project funding for Mr. fiint. In response to specific |
question Mr. O'Malley stated that on Nr. Hunt's return to

staff employment. the projects and funding which stopped in
-.-July 1965 were again. resumed. Mr..Q'Malley was not aware

as Chief of Support, any activity undertaken to support : - ot

Mr. Hunt's assignment to Madrid was undertaken second

on the David St. Joha Novels

1. Oa the morning of 7 February 1974 Messrs. ,
’ Frederick BVans: and: Lawrence Howe interviewed Mr. Raymond
‘A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations. .
: The purpose of tha interview was to follow up on infor-

mation contained in Office of Security files which stated

mo the belief that individuals in the Counter Intelligence
; ’ Operations office had knowledge of tha writing activities. ~
of Nr, E. Howard Hunt. This belief was a matter of record |
in the files of the former Security Research Staff and was
attributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now retired, and | Mr. Edward

Sayle. : ,

~ 2, During ‘this interview Mr. Roces was specifically | :
-. askad whether or not he had knowledge of the existence of Coote
“any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr. :
- E. Howard Hunt ‘to writo novels to improve the image of
this Agency. Additionally, Nr. Rocca was asked whether
or not any assistance was ever requasted of the Counter
21ligence..Operations offics.to be provided to Mr. Hunt
7 ad ever had any relationship
with Mr. Hunt what: “In responss to theses questions °
“on the record" that he has no knowledge

3. Mr. Rocca -was.. thoroughly . candid: and cooperative :
during the course of this intervicw. He was unable to ‘
suggest alternate means of attempting to deternine if
any: official Agency sponsorship of Mr. Hunt did in fact

| exist. Mr. Rocca did venture the opinion that he felt .
that in all probability an official acquiescence on the. : 4 .
part of senior officials might have been involved rather . i. i
‘than.an official sponsorship. It was agreed. by all in . é
this discussion that the nature of any informal support

' given to Mr. Hunt would be far more difficult to define

Mr. Hunt was undsr any form of Agency: sponsorship in his
writing of the David St. John novels. Nr. Pfortzheimer replied
that he was never officially briefed on the matter and that
-orily Mr. Helms. or Mr. Karamessines could provide the answer.
MY. Pforzheimer was then asked if either Mr. Angleton or Mr.
Rocca of Counter Intelligence Operations would have any
knowledge of this activity. Mr. Pforzheimor replied that he.

4. Mr. P£orzheimer went. on to relate that he was
Occasionally tasked to do research for Mr. Hunt. He recalled
on one occasion being asked to research the Indian religious.

ites involving use of funeral pyres, Nr. Pforzheiner :
remembered that this theme figures significantly in Mr. Huntts.

pointed out the origin of the pen name as being the names of .
Mr. Hunt's two sons--David and St. John. .
