found a letter waiting for her which had been forwarded to her office

‘not let her, She did, however, manage to destroy a page from her note-

“hy JoeB ED prancisco ABAD: AMFAUNA-14 believes that this is hig —
alo neme, He no roduce himself, but she saw the name on her
release papers which he signed. He was born about 1918 and is about
5°4" tall, weighs about 160 pounds, and haz a fat build, aquiline nose,
greenish eyes, dark skin, grey-brown wavy hair, rough laborer's hands,
and two teeth missing from the lower jaw. He smokes both cigars and
cigarettes, hia manner was soft and kindly, and AMFAUNA-14 believes
-he ie probably poorly educated. He is married, but AMFAUNA-14 did not
arn whether he has children or what his address is. He wears civilia
/plothes and drives a black 1956 Pontiac with a grey roof. Discussing ~
@ man later in the AMCOG household, AHFAUNA-14 was told by Pedro
TLL (whois 8 brother_of Justo CARRILLO) that Pedro knows ABAD. —
ing to Pedro, ABAD is part Jewish and\an old Communist who worked
half of Fidel TRO during the Batista
pariod. Pedro CARRILLO thinks that ABAD may now have some regrets
about the course he has taken. :

Rs

(b) "Carlos" aka "Samuel": AMFAUNA-14 does not know hie true
nawe, He was born about 1942 or perhaps a little earlier, He is
about 5'6" tall, weighs about 150 pounds, and has a muscular build, —
drooping eyelids, light olive skin, wavy chestnut hair with a widows —
peak. He is a nervous pacer, and walks with his head bent forward and
tilted slightly to one side, An expression which he frequently used
was "0.E." pronounced “OKAH" with the accent on the first syllable.

He told AMFAUNA-14 that he had been a student in the Commercial School
of Havana, that he had worked clandestinely under the Batista regime,
had been arrested by Col, Esteban VENTURA Novo, had been released due
to the influence of his father, and had gotten. out.of the country with
the aid of the Mexican Ambassador to Cuba, coming then to the United
States. He drives a 1959 black and white Chevrolet Corvair, wears

: Givilian clothes, and carries a pistol, sometimes a .45 and sometimes
a .38, AMFAUNA-14 believes him to be a 100% Communist, She thinks he

' gay have been somewhat better trained than Francisco ABAD and may have
been somewhat superior in rank, although this was never clearly evident
There seemed to be a little professional jealousy between the two men.
IZ she told one man something which she had been unable to remember
for the other, the second would show signs of jealousy or resentment.
"Carlos" subsequently told AMPAUNA-14 to phone 61-4319 and ask for
“Samuel” when she wanted to reach him. She phoned him at this number
bout ten times in all. The phone was alwaye answered by the same
woman, except for. once when a boy answered and then called for his
mcther to come and take the phone, AHFAUNA-14 would ask for "Samuel"
aud the woman would invariably reply that he was not there. AMFAUNA-
14 would then ask the woman to take a message for him to please call
“Dolores.” The woman would always reply "Yes, Comrade." Discussing
this person later within the AMCOG household, AMFAUNA-14 was told by
Tereel (PADILLA Sthat he, thought "Carlos" Samuel TILES. $¢f5S*

-‘Arujo (born 7 December 1935) travelled to Chile in March and April 1963
on @ diplomatic passport, An AMOT report of 27 September 1962 mentions
one Antonia CARCANO Araujo as a communist in charge of vigilance, and
living at 47 Artes St., Casablanca. There also appears to be a Maria
ARAUJO (born about 1908) who ig an old-time Communist living at Artes
47. AMFAUNA-1 has been given the names of several former residents of
this neighborhood in hopes of finding a relative of the CARCANO or
ARAUJO families whose physical description matches that of "Carlos,"
AMIPAUMA-1 has also interviewed Col, VENTURA in the WAVE aren, VENTURA

AGVAUHA-14's connection with NEGRET had been, AMFAUNA-14 said that
NEGRET had been in her house once, and once in her mother's,

13. At this point ‘in the interrogation, ABAD was called away and
AMFAUHA-14 was returned to her cell. Two hours later the interrogation
was rosuned, ; : &

23. ABAD picked up where he had left off, and asked AMFAUNA-14
what connection she had had with Angel BRINGAS. AMFAUNA-14- said that
ske had known BRINGAS no better than she had known NEGRET., ABAD said
that she was lying and urged that she cooperate. AMFAUNA-14 promised
that she would cooperate. ABAD said that NEGRET had told the DSE that
AMVAUHA-14 had had sexual relations with BRINGAS, and AMFAUNA-14 denied
the allegation,

Cooperate with the Ddz, as’ AMFAUNA-1 had briefed her to do in such a
| ‘situation,

«

15. - ABAD began by telling her that she was in a very serious 3.
situation, because he knew that she had had very close connections
wath a KUBARK agent. ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-1 was identical with

_ "Julio." AMPAUNA-14 caid that AMFAUNA-1 had been known as "Julio,"
ABAD then wanted to know whether NEGRET had been working with "Julio,"
AMPAUNA-14 denied this, ABAD asked whether NEGRET had known "Julio."
AMPAUNA-14 denied this too, but volunteered the information that "Julio"
had provided NEGRET with mail facilities, and that AMFAUNA-14 had been
the cutout between them, Did NBGRET know uf "Julio's" existface, ABAD
wanted to know. AMFAUKA-14 said that herda2d not , that she had brought .
NBGRET mail and money which she had gotten from "Julio," and had picked
wail up from him and delivered it to “Sulto," but that NEGRET had .
never known "Julio's" identity.

16, The truth about AMFAUNA-14's relations with NEGRET and BRINGAS
according to her statements to her KUBARK case officer in November 1963
in the JMWAVE area, is as follows:

: (a) In about mid-1962, AMCOG-2 asked AMFAUNA-14 to serve as:

outout’ ‘between herself and an unident 4 fied agent, and AMFAUNA-14
agreed. AMFAUNA-14 was driven to the meeting site, which was on the
sidewalk in front of a textile factory near Calle 100 in Marianao, by
ANCOG-2's chauffeur, a Spaniard named "Segundo," This agent introduced |.
himself to ANFAUNA-i4 only as."Bl *NEGRO", and AMFAUNA-14 described .
herself to him as an employee of an unidentified embassy. For contact .

_ purposes, ‘“R1 Negro" gave her the telephone number 29-4800 or 40-4900,

bY (b) Later, w when AMFAUNA-14 began to trust "El Negro" more,
{ ehe gave hin the telephone number of her mother, She learned that

“MRT Kagrofa" true name waa tariea Rranlio VILLAR Negret, and that he

= ‘Lived in a amall room in the rear of the textile factory, The telephon
‘Humber which he had given her was always answered by a woman whose
Geme she learned to be “Waximina."

(c) VILLAR Negret was born about 1928, and was about B11"

tall with broad shoulders and.a strong build. He had black wavy hair.
brewn eycs, an olive skin, and a face marked by acne. AMFAUNA-14 —

. Bever learned anything about his family directly from him, but DSE
officers told her that he was married with one child,
parents lived on a farm in Pinar del Rio Province.

. (4d) VILLAR Negret was a member o ucionaria |.
‘Denocratica, which AMFAUNA-14 understands to be a successor organizatiog’
to the AAA of Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango, He had formerly belonged to _ |}
en action component of this organization, but more recently had de- -

voted himself? to intelligence collection. AMFAUNA-14 brought hb eh sy |

(£) According to what the DSE officers told her, "El Negro"
was errested about 1 October and was to be shot. AMFAUNA-14 asked her
DSE interrogators whether it would not be possible to reindoctrinate
“Bl Negro" instead of shoot him, but they told her that it was not
worth the trouble because "El Negro" was raon of low _ morals who.

be shown to Angel BRINGAS when and 12 ue As Caugnt,

(g) On 12 or 13 October 1963, after AMFAUNA-14 had been re- -
leased, she was telephoned at her Place of employment by Angel BRINGAS .
who told her guardedly that "51 Negro" had been arrested and said that
he would like to send a female cousin of his to talk to AMFAUNA-14. A
meeting was arranged in the home of ANFAUHA-14'a mother, The female
cousin, whose name was "Gladys", told AMFAUNA-14 that BRINGAS had gone
into hiding and wondered whether "the family with which she worked" |
(the AMCOGS) could help him get into asylum. AMFAUNA-14 said that she
doubted this. "Gladys" told AMFAUNA-14 that, in case it were possible
to do anything for BRINGAS, she should tclephone "Gladys" with an.
ipnocent message. It was understood that @ meeting would take place at
19800 hours on the same day of the telephune call at the Ten Cent Store
S3rd between 10th and 12th in Vedado. AH#AUNA-14 does not remember |
Gladys telephone number which was left with her mother.

(bh) In spite of what AMFAUNA-14 told the D8E, AMFAUNA~1 had:
had nothing to do with NEGRET. AMFAUNA-14 had told this story to pro-
tect ANCOG-2, NEGRST had known that AMCOG-2 was involved, and had once
had a meeting with her in her home. Nevertheless, AMFAUNA-14 briefed
ANCOG-3 on the cover story which she had told the DSE and told her that,
dn case she were ever arrested and questioned, she should admit having
talked to KEGRET in her home, but deny having been involved in the
communications channel or knowing anything about it.

17, ABAD appeared to be particularly interested in how NEGRET and

"Julio" obtained their funds, and kept returning to this subject during
the interrogation, ; :

16, ABAD then addressed himself to the contents of the envelope
and a guitcase found in AMFAUNA-14's apartment, He commented that all
these things appeared to belong to AMFAUNA-1 and his son, and asked how
they happened to be there, AMFAUNA-14 replied that AMNFAUNA-1 and his”
son, together with AMFAUNA-3, had been hiding for a few days in her
apartment because their usual hiding place had become unavailable.

19. ABAD wanted to know how and when AMFAUNA-14 had first tet
AMPAUHA-1. ANFAUNA-14 replied that she had met AMFAUNA-1 in about.
February 1962, that AMFAUNA-1 had regularly parked hie car in a lot near
her office and that they had seen each other on the street frequently,
that ANFAUNA-1 hed finally spoken to her, and that a friendship had:-:
developed which finally turned into a love affair. (Comment: This was
a lie told to conceal the fact that it had been AMCUTLER-@ who had in--
troduced thes.) She said that AMFAUNA-1 had been her lover until about.
July 1963 when she broke up with him because he was too busy with
clandestine work to pay the proper amount of attention to her,

30, ABAD asked what part AMFAUNA-14 had played in AMFAUNA-l1's .
clandestine activities, AMFAUNA-14 replied that AMFAUNA-1..would some-
. tises telephone her late at night to invite her to go out for a ride,

and she would then find that AMFAUNA-1 was going out to have agent
seetings and wanted her along for cover, ABAD asked whom AMFAUNA-1 had
been meeting. AMFAUNA-14 mentioned a person known as "Gustavo" and

gave the physical description
out of Cuba. (She never knew AMFAUNA-24's true name.) She also mentioned
Manolo *VILLAMANAN, the true name of AMFAUNA-13 (whom she: had. known
Only as AMFAUNA-1's buciness partner but when she thought she ‘could :
safoly mention now that he was out of Cuba.) For good measure she added
@ notional name and physical description. : : : \

21. Referring back to AMFAUNA-1'e automobile, ABAD asked what
kind of a car he had driven, AMFAUNA-14 replied that it was a gray
Chevrolet Impala. She repeated that ANFAUNA-1 had formerly parked it
near her office, but said that she had not ssen it recently. ABAD
apked where AMFAUNA-1's red car was, and she said she did not know, He
asked what the license number on this car was, and.she said she did not
know. He never asked anything about the third car which AMFAUNA-1 had .

obtained. ;
92. ABAD commented that the DSE had observed AMFAUNA-1 in his

gutomobile in the Havana dock area on 1 January 1963, having a meeting
with another person. (AMFAUNA-14 recalls that this other person was

after an attempt to pick up AMFAUNA-]'s radio.

$3. With reference to the KUBARK agent known as "Julio", whom
they had recently identified with AMFAUNA-1, ABAD said that he knew
that "Julio" had left Cuba in October 1962 and believed that he had
gone to Rurope, but he said he did not know whether "Julio" had gone

Clandestinely or legally. :

234. AMFAUNA~14 wae asked about AMFAUNA~1's subsources in other

provinces, but she said she knew nothing about them. ABAD said he was
eure that ANPAUNA-1 had a good anuree on tha Tala of Pinas. Whorne war
name might be "Raul". ABAD also mentioned the name of a person who had
been shot about two weeks previously and who he believed had been work-
dug with AMFAUNA-1. (AMFAUNA-14 doee not remember the name of this

percon. )

25. ABAD asked if AMFAUNA-1's son had helped him in this clandes-:
tine work. AMPAUNA-14. replied that the son had been with AMFAUNA-1 .
freqvontly, but that she thought it was only because he was’helping — .
AMWPAUNA-1 with hie buainess and that the son probably had had nothing
to do with clandestine work. wee ; :

apartsent, and said he could see she was not cooperating with him, She

was not voluntecring information, he said, but waiting to be asked
questions, ABAD said he was sure that there was much that AMFAUNA-14
could tell him spontaneously, and he intimated that there might be a-
chaace for her to rehabilitate herself.

weplied that they had been left in her apartment by AMFAUNA-1, who .
dutended to instruct her later by SW what to do with them, She said
that AMFAUNA~1 had trained her in this system, and had left her his.
materials, so that he could use her as a stop-gap communications 2ine

while he was trying to reorganize hie net. Crvigw

38. ABAD told her that this was plainly ni ue, cause some 0
the lists were dated later than AMFAUNA-1's departure date. He said he
they hed been brought to AMFAUNA-14's apartment by, AMCUTLER-2,
‘who had been observed coming there on 5 October with Loliypf*CORREOSO.
(fais was true, according to AMFAUNA-14. AMCUTLER-2 and lin CORREOSO
had brought the pasgenger manifests to AMFAUNA-14's house at about 1630
or 1700 hours on 5& October, and had stayed about fifteen minutes, AT

the first in two weeks, initiated by AMFAUNA-39 by means of a telephone
call to AMFAUNA-1's mother. who was serving as cutout between them. .
AMPAUNA-38 had called the meeting to ask whether she had received any
instructions from AMFAUNA-1 as to how to,act in case of an internal
upriging, which a number of people in Cuba seemed to be expecting about

Of AMFAUNA-24, whom ghe knew to be safely’ -

AMPAUNA-24, and that he and AMFUANA-1 had rendezvoused in the dock area ~

1400 hours that samc day, AMFAUNA-14 had had a meeting with AMFAUNA-39, .

of periodic spot check, )

830. ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 how she had become acquainted with
ARCUTLER-3, and AHNFAUNA-14 repjied that she had met AMCUTLER-2 through
AMPAUNA-15, the wife of a cousin of AMFAUNA~14 Who is a prisoner on the
Iele of Pines,

“90, ABAD then asked AMFAUNA~14 where her SW materiales were, which.
surprised AMFAUNA-14 because she had thought they had been found during
her house search and were part of the incriminating envelope which ABAD
was holding. AHNFAUNA-14 told ABAD where to look for the materials, and
he gent somebody to get then,

92, ABAD wanted to know how AMFAUNA-i and AMFAUNA-3 had gotten out
of Cuba. AMFAUNA-14 said she did not know, She said she understood they
were to get their instruction on the street once they had left her apart-|

ment.
33. ABAD abruptly asked AMFAUNA~ 14 wh whether she knew anybody in

‘ayano, AMFAUNA-14 said she did not, hen produced a. photograph
of ANPAUNS-14 together with AMFAUNA-1 and bare 29|and told her that she :

He asked AMFAUNA<-14!whetherlAM@EE32 were employed in an embassy, AMFAUN.

to be a personal friend of AMFAUNA-1, and thought that he might
occasionally have helped AMFAUNA-1 with his mail. (It was true that

admitted having seen AMFAUNA-1 with a Minox camera, but said she did not
krow what AMIFAUNA-1 had done with it, She said she had hoped that
AMPAUHA~1 would leave it with her, and pretended to be hurt that he had
pot done so. ABAD asked her whether she had ever seen one like it in
‘the A8CO0G house, and ANFAUNA-14 said that she had, Throughout the

think he was doing anything clandestine. ABAD replied that the DSE
positive that AKCOG-3 was doing secret work. AMFAUNA-14 said tha

had been involved somehow with her sister who Jives in Florida, ABAD
asked whether AMFAUNA-14 had been a good friend of AMFAUNA-3, and she
@aid that she had been, ABAD asked whether AMFAUNA-14 had ever heard
AHPAUNA-3 speak about the Escambray insurgents, AMFAUNA-14 said that
she had not. ABAD asked whether ANFAUNA~3 had had contacts with any
embassy people, for example the Spanish Embavsy. AMFAUNA~-14 said that
she did not know of any such contacts. .

37. "How abcut ANCUTLER-3?" askec ABAD, "Wo know that she spends
(& lot of time there," AMPAUNA-14 said she did rot know, ’

838. ABAD asked AMFAUNA-14 if she were # revolutionary, AMFAUNA-14
said that she was not, but that neither was the against the revolution.
She said that she had joined the militia early in the revolution, but
had soop dropped out because there were some things about the revolution
which she did not understand, For instance, she could not underetand
why thore should be so many shortages and rationing, whereas before the
revolution there had been plenty. ABAD exp)sined that the shortages wer
the result of the imperialist blockade of Cvba. AMFAUNA-14 seid that
she could underatand this, but that it did mot explain why there should |
be a shortage of coffee when Cuba grew its own, ABAD said that coffee
was in short supply because Cuba was sending coffee to the Soviet Union
in gratitude for Soviet assistance in overcoming shortages caused by the
imperialist blockade. §AHFAUNA-14 replied that this was very logical
now that it had been explained to her, and said she wondered why the
revolutionary government did not publicly say so in order to put an end
to public grumbling on the subject. 4

38, .Barly in the morning of 9 October, ABAD produced the letter ™
which AMPAUNA-14 received from AMFAUNA-1 on 7 October and held up the
letter to the light, examining it carefully for traces of SW. AMFAUNA-
UAto developer pilile wore brought end che wae tald ta davealan the latta
which ehe did in the presence of ABAD, "Carlos, "anda third man whom
ehe Was unable to get a good look at. All were very surprised and
disappointed when nd secret writing appeared. They kept asking her if
she were sure she was doing it right, and began intimating that she was
deceiving them. (Station Comment: It is indeed surprising that no
secret writing appeared, because this letter was almost undoubtedly the.
one containing SW message no, 1 to AMFAUNA-14,)

40. ANFAUNA-14 also explained the use of her carbons, The only
accommodation address ehe gave away was AMFAYNA-1's JMWAVE area post
office box. She deliberately protected the (Rosa JUSTIZ hddress. (the
home of ANPAN~2), not knowing whether this waa a real or a fictitious
person, GA oY

41. "Carlos" and ABAD now invited AMFAUNA-14 to work with them, She
Feplied that she might be willing to do a0, but first wanted to know
what work would be expected of her, For instance, she said, she would
not inform on people in her office, They told her that this would not
be askedof her, because that sort of work is done by the Defense
Committees. Her work, they said, would be much more important, namely
maintaining a link between themselves and KUBARK. She said that would
be all right, but she was afraid that it would not last long because
KUBARK would probably put her on ice as soon as they learned that she
had been arrested, They told her not to worry about that.

42. °"Carlos" and ABAD suggested to her that AMFAUNA-1 had briefed
her to agree to cooperate with them, She denied this, claiming that she
had not really wanted to work with AMFAUNA~1 at all, but had merely let
herself be imposed on for old times sake, They asked whether they
could trust her, She said she thought so, and asked whether she could
trust them to ksep their promises, They assured her that she could,
and said whe would be released the following day. : .

43. In the morning of 10 October, atter. being. to1d that she was to
be released, AMPAUNA-14 was moved to a smaller cell without a bath. ‘She:
sent for ABAD and complained “that he-had double~crossed her. He told

14-00000

UFGA-12894

Bune

her that he was going to keep his word and release her, but that her
original cell was needed for some new prisoners who were expected. He
said that the DSEZ had received advance word that a boatload of refugees:

were going to try to leave Cuba that night. Many of them were women,
ton one of there was pregnant, so he wanted the larger cell with bath
or then,

44. ABAD plways trented AMFAUNA-14 kindly and considerately,
When she had 8 headache, he ordered aspirin fcr her, Hévsaw to it that
she received soft drinks when she wanted them, and he seemed to be-
honestly distressed whenever she wert. AKIAUNA-14 believes that it had
been the DSE's intention from the very beginning to recruit her, be-
eaguse she doubts that all DSE prisoners are treated as well,

48. The firet SW message which AMFAUNA-14 wrote while under DSE
control was dated 10 October, the day of her release. The DSE officers
asked her what her control signal. was, and she replied that it was a
rubrio, but algo included her true control signal. She deliberately
ausbered her first controlled SW message no. 2, to conceal the fact
that she had already written several messages containing intelligence
reports, —

46. In all she wrote three SW messages. under control, She was ;
obliged to write each one in duplicate, one ‘of which was mailed and the
other given to the DSE for study.. One day "Carlos" came to her very
.-{ angrily, said he doubted that her carbons were anything more than
5 | _ ordinary paper because he had been unable to develop anything | that she |

Hy ww and @hmnntadnd bane wed th mn mermavrar a
hag srittcn, and threatcasd her with roarrcost. AMTAUNA-14 told hin

V | that she did not know anything about it, but that if by chance he had

|. tried to deveiop the letters she had written with the pills he had
‘taken-from her, it would not work, This surprised "Carlos," and
-AMPAUNA-14 explained that there were two different SW systems, one for
outgoing mail and the other for incoming. "Carlos" then asked her if .
' there were. any significance to the size of envelope used, or to the way:
‘the letter paper was folded, AMFAUNA-14 said she did not think so.
AMFAUNA-14 feels that "Carlos" and ABAD never completely believed that
. he bad an SW system, because none of the letters which she received
disclosed SW when developed, and none of the letters which she wrote
showed any traces of 8W when held up to glancing light.

* 47, "Carlos" was the DSE officer who maintained contact with
AWPAUNA-14 after her release. For two or three weeks he saw her every
- day at her apartment, sometimes for only twenty minutes, and sometimes
ataying for several hours, frequently late at night. Occasionally he
called her at her office. Finally AMFAUNA-14 told him that she had to
get up early in the morning to go to work, and asked him to visit her
‘early in the evening, which he agreed to do, At.the time of the in-

' tercepted AMGLOSSY landing in Pinar del Rio, "Carlos" did not visit
“AMPAUNA-14 for five days. When he finally returned, he was dirty,
aweaty and tired. He dictated an SW letter he wanted AMFAUNA-14 to
-gend to KUBARK, and while she was writing it he fell asleep.

- "@8, AMFAUNA-14 had to prepare written reports for him, which she
:“pigned. with the pseudonym "Dolores," He told her never to call him at
‘ DSB headquarters, because he was never there. Once he brought her a
book on Marxism to read, and promised to take her someday to visit a
collective farm in Pinar del Rio Province,

49. Despite his occasional efforts to get her to pick up the thread
of the AMFAUNA net, AMFAUNA-14 believes that the primary target she was
. intended to work against. was the AMCOG household. From remarks made by
both ABAD and "Carlos", she deduced that they already had an informer
-in the house, but that they were not satisfied with his production,

- Toward the end of her period of DSE -controlled activi jen felt that
| the DSB was becoming relatively less interested in AM
“net, and more in the AMCOG household.

81. With the knowledge and encourdgement of the DS, AUFAUNA-14
vigited the ANCOG house nearly every day. Her first visit took place
at noon on 1] October and she stayed until about 1800 hours, during
which time she told AMCOG-3 the entire story. He listened and took a
few notes, but kept most of the story in his memory, He encouraged

and calmed AMPAUNA~14, told her to follow DSE instructions to the letter
and assured her that KUBARK would send her instructions.

71. AMPAUNA-14 turned this report over to "Carlos" on 11 or 12
November, At this meeting he asked her to try to make contact with
AMFAUNA-3's brother who he said had- been transferred to a hospital in
Las Villas. AMFAUNA-14 said she would try, but thought it would be: .
difficult, This was the last time she saw "Carlos,'"' He telephoned her
again on 16 November t ask what was new, and this was their last 1
telephone contact.

72, When AMFAUNA-14 arrived at AMCOG-3's house at about 2000-hours
on 15 November 1963 tor the regular Friday night supper, he took her
aside and said he wanted to speak to her privately later. At about
4330 hours she went to his room. There he told her that he had received
orders that she was to leave Cuba the following week. He said that
precise instructions were to come on 16 and 17 November, so he made a
lunch date with her for Sunday noon at his house.

73. AMFAUNA-14 was frightened by this, She did not sleep well
Priday or Saturday nights, and spent Saturday in her home.

74. Sunday afternoon in AMCOG-3's house, AMCOG-3 told her that she
was to leave the following day. She said that she did not want to.
AMCOG-3 responded that this was an order, He said that the DSE would
probably arrest her again soon, and for her own safety and that of other
she must leave. He added that there were others who were to leave too,
whose departure had been made conditional upon her own, :

75. AMFAUNA-14 asked whether AMCUTLER-2 were one of these other
people who were to leave too, and AMCOG-3 replied that she was.
14 told him that she thought AMCUTLER-2 would not agree to leave,
said that he thought she would because the orders had been couched in
very strong terms,

76. He then showed her the instructions, both for herself and for
AMCUTLER-2. He had her type her instructions on a piece of paper, and

then memorize them,

77, Then AMCOG-3 gave AMFAUNA-14 the following verbal. messages” ‘to
deliver when she reached JMWAVE: .

: (a) A colonel fnu LANDEIRA, a tank expert who had ‘been. in the
Cuban Army under GRAU and PRIO, is a prisoner on a farm in Havana Pro=
vince. He is given three days off per week to go home. His wife knows
in advance when he will be coming out, AMCOG-3 does not know the wife}
but has indirect contact to her, AMCOG-3 says the man is honest and

‘ intelligent and fas real soldier, and if we want him out AMCOG-3 can
arrange it. . .

had been noved to a new hiding place, AMCOG-3 was considering trying

to help the young man into asylum in the Uruguayan Embassy through a

certain ("Pepin") whose identity is not known to AMFAUNA-14 but; who she
thinks is oe" UFuguayan attache.

{c) AMCOG-3 is out of one-time pads and needs a resupply.

(d) It is very possible that AMCUd-3 may be able to obtain
and forward a copy of AMFAUNA- 14 DSE dossier.

78. On Monday morning, 18 November, AMFAUNA-14 dressed as she had
been instructed, and atuffed a pair of slacks and sneakers into the
straw handbag which she had been told to carry. At 1300 hours she left
her office and proceeded on foot to the coiner of Atares and Arango in
Reparto Luyano, arriving there at 1400 hours, Here she exceeded her
instructions, waiting for AMCUTLER~-2 not five minutes but fifteen, She
then walked very slowly toward Calzada Luyano, hoping that AMCUTLER-2
might overtake her, This consumed another ten minutes, and by the time
she reached the Calzada Luyano it was too iate for. her to walk the re-

mainder of the distance, so she took a taxi.

78. AMPAUNA-14 discharged the taxi one block before theParque de
la Virgen del Camino and walked the rest of the way. She went to the
sbrine where she prayed for a few minutes, and then sat on a bench
from which she could see the whole park.

80. At 1510 hours a 1954 Buick taxi arrived at the park. The
driver stayed in the car, and two men ~ a colored man and a fatr-haired
man - got out and walked around for about ten minutes, Finally they
approached her and gave the challenge, to which she gave the correct
response, One of the men then said simply "Follow me", They took her
back to the taxi and put her in the back seat with one of the men, the.
other two riding in front. .

81. . They headed out of the city. When the reached the Carretera
de Varadero, one of the men asked her politely if she would mind keepin
her eyes directed down toward the floor and not look out the window.
She rode this way for about two hours, By then it was dark, and she wa
told she could look up again. She took advantage of the opportunity to
change into her slacks and sneakers.

82. Finally the car stopped, and she and her two escorts got out;
They walked a long time. At one point, whistle signals were exchanged
with someone in the darkness, and two other men appeared, one of whom:
was AM@KE}2. AMPAUNA-14 and AWWEE}2 greeted each other politely, but *
pretendeddnot to know each other. dt

83, They did a lot more walking and joined up with another man, wh
turned out to be the radio man. He had a lot of equipment with him,
and AMPAUNA-14 and AH@EE}2 helped to carry it.

84. They now reached the mangrove and began to walk through water,
At one point their guide became briefly lost, but found his way again
almost.-immediately, When they came to the open water, one of the guide!
went forward and signalled. The boat came in in response to the signal
AMPAUNA-14 »\ E}+2, and the radio man walked out Into knee-deep water
and climbed into the boat, which already had a crew of two,

85. The boat proceeded out to an unidentified key, The crew con-
cealed it in the mangrove, cleverly lacing and tying branches together
over it to form a camouflage cover, There they went to sleep.

86. The following day, 19 November, was spent at this spot. A
radio message was received during the day, At night the boat put -out
for Cayo Wegano, The waves were enormous, and. AMFAUNA-14 was terribly

seasick. The boat remained at the rendezvous point until 1045 hours, -”

with AMPAUNA-14 pleading for the crew to return to land, saying she .
would rather be shot than remain so seasick. Finally the crew did put
back, saying that the ship probably would not come because thé sea was

long radio message was received during the day. AMFAUNA-14 and ‘AWE, 2
both helped the radio man to decipher it, and their combined efforts
took about three hours,’ Then they put out again for ‘the Cayo Megano ;
rendezvous point. By this time their drinking water was all gone, |
The boat was overloaded, so much of the food'and equipment was left
behind on the key. Again no ship appeared. -This time, instead of |
returning to their original hiding Place, the crew took the boat to

Here they spent the remainder of. tha'‘night, and all ct Thursday

decipher it. Everybody: Ba very optimistic; they were all sure that

they would be picked up that night. 7

AMPAUNA-14 was taken into the sick bay where she was given a pill

90; From the moment she stepped into the ‘boat on 18 November, unt if
she was hauled out by ‘the armpits on 21 November, AMFAUNA~14 riever lef
the boat. Her side and legs were bruised from the pounding of the
waves: against: the boat. A little blood vessel in her‘right eye was
broken by a twig snapping in her face as she walked through the man-
grove, This was treated by the ship's! doctor, i

el. ” AMFAUNA~ 14 says that the AMHICK team performed very well, The
pickup in the park was. done excellently, The slight delay while they
looked her over, she says, was due to the fact that the men had ex-
pected another woman to be with her, and they were waiting a few minute
in case the other woman should show up, The AMHICK. team said that the
had also boen briefed that she would be wearing her hair in a bun,
She had not been briefed accordingly, and she was wearing her hair
down her back in a pony tail, This discrepancy did not cause any con-
fusion, because every other item of the visual recognition signals :

@2, AMFAUNA-14 was impressed by the precise timing of the team's:
movements, by the fact that everybody was where he was supposed to be
at the time indicated, She expressed admiration for their seamanship,
and their ability to pick out one spot of mangrove from another in
the pitch darkness,

93. She says that, during these trying days, the team members were
alwaya in cals control of the situation, and never failing in their
courtesy to her,

94. Regarding AMCUTLER~-2, AMFAUNA-14 is sure that the exfiltration

who had been standing by for them from Friday to Sunday. What Lolita
did with them, ANFAUNA-14 does not. know, She knows that we had
suggested that Lolita take them to AMFAUNA-1's mother, but she also
knows that we had indicated to AMCOG-3 that AMFAUNA-1's mother might
be under surveillance, so she thinks Lolita might have taken them
directly to AMCUTLER-2. In any case, she knows that messages sent
previously by AMCOG~3 to AMCUTLER-2 reached the latter, and she sees
no reason to assume that these instructions did not.

95... It does not surprise AMFAUNA~14 that AMCUTLER-2 did not follow
the.orders,  ANCUTLER-2, she says, plays her own game with little con-
ration for others, Between the time that AMFAUNA-1 left Cuba on
J September, and the time that AMFAUNA-14 was arrested on 7 O¢tobe T,

nei,

SECRET‘! " urcd- 12804

AMPAUNA-14 had asked her to remove the suitcase that AMFAUNA-i had ieft
behind, but on both occasions AMCUTLER-2 had found some excuse not to
do so, When AMFAUNA-14 visited AMCUTLER-2 in her home in. Guanabacoa
on 3 November for the purpose of coordinating their cover stories,
AMCUTLER-2 did not seem very interested in coordinating stories or
anything else. AMFAUNA-14 believes that AMCUTLER-2 may be working for
the-Geceed=<Front-of the Second Front of the Escambray, becaus@-her 7...
‘very close friend Lolin *CORREOSO is the fiancee of.Hipolito ARRAURI fe
who wes a collector for this organization. Among other reasgns
possibly keeping AMCUTLER-2 in. Cuba, AMFAUN‘-14 says that AMCUTLER-2's
mother is sick with cancer, and there may te something wrong between
AMCUTLER- 1 and AMCUTLER-2. HE veka 48 .

96. - AMPAUNA-14 algo had her reasons for not wanting to pees Cuba.
Besides the dangers of the trip, she would he leaving her mother and
father in a dangerous position, because the DSE had forced her to
sign a confersion implicating them. While she appears to be trying not
to be overly critical of AMCUTLER-2, she has commented that AMCUTLER-2
knows far more members of the AMFAUNA net than she herself does, so
that the reasons requiring the exfiltration of AMFAUNA-14 should be
even more compelling for AMCUTLER-2,
