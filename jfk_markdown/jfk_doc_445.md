SUBJECT : Operational Approval for LITAMIL-9

SET RL

1. The Provisional Operational Approval for LITAWIL-9
(C-101331) is due to expire 8 January 1965.

2. In discussions with the field case officer |for this
operation, WH/1/Mexico has found that there is no batd to
determine when, or whether, LITAMIL-9 will-again leave Cuba.
For reasons of personal security, LITAMIL-9 has not |been
able to function as a repurring ovaree waeeed Lis rofurn te
Cuba in early March 1965. Letters to his brother, LITAMIL-17,
and reports from occasional Cuban official travelerg transiting
Mexico indicate that LITAMIL-9 is well and is employed by the
National Cultural Council.

has recently proposed that his salary cease accumulating

as of 30 June 1966. If and when he again manages t leave .

Cuba, he will be contacted and a full assessmeut of| his =
future usefulness will be made. Owing to the fact that his '
sister-in-law is a secretary to Fidel Castro it is prpected

that he will be a valuable source of information, a

od
for an initial debriefing period.

—

: PS]

4. It would be appreciated if the POA on LITAMIL-9
could be extended for six months. If at the end of thas
time he has not left Cuba, it will be propesed that theo
POA be allowed to expire. =

reluctance to interview a Mexican officer who alleged|in

to our interest in LITAMIL-9. WH/) has concurred in this
decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogatory

1. An Operational Approval is requested for dab Fr
J

2. Realizing the risk involved in working with any
Cuban national, WH/1 feels that LITAMIL-9's excellent |record
of cooperation, plus his acceptance of tue idea of continued
cooperation in a denied area favor consideration of a

t Operational Approval. Additionally, we have had audi
coverage through the telephone in LITAMIL-9's office for
the past two years or more, and during this time the Station
has used the installation for spot checking his information,
and is satisfied that there are no reasons to question his
veracity and security or suspect that he is under control
of the Cuban service. .

Z 3. Attached fer your review are several contact
reports of LITAMIL-9, as requested by Mr. Lally. Their
prompt return will be appreciated. This office vill te
Pleased to cooperate in any further review of this case

MEMORANDUM POR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: LITAKIL-9, Report of TDY, Andrew 8. Parmers|

1. During 21-26 February 1963, Andrew 8. P, ERS
travelled from Headquarters to Mexico City on TNY to train
LITAMIL~9 on various clandestina, operational, techniques,
including SW. Upon arrival in Mexico City PARMERS ascertained
that LITAMIL~9 allegedly became of moral inbibitions, wes
unwilling to receive training 2nd also unwilling to accept the
SWosyatwes Headquarters had iseved for him, and which PAKMERS
had carried to Yexico City. Neverthe'ess, PARVERS met LITAUIL-9
three times to determine the age2ats precise objections] and to
overcome them if possible. Although the agents generat
Treeiatance was not overcame. DARUERS Aid raviaw with rrrautria
Clandestine methods and techniques in a general way.

2. The first meeting was held. at the Station case
officers home, with the Case Officer present. LITAMIL+9 exe
Plained his reasons for refusing to be trained and for| ot
being willing to communicate in SW with KUBARX while in Cuba.
Generally LITAMIL~9 claimed that he ig very nervous, ata
incapable of performing clandestine tasks without having w
nervous breakdown and at the san- time getting himself caught
in the act because of hig general incomvetancy. Also, |LITAUTL.@
was planning to stay at 5is brothers home in Cuba, and|felt
it would be unethical and immoral for him to be commun cating“
Clandestinely with KUBARK while accepting the hospital {ty of
his brother and sister-in-law who are staunch supporters of the
Castro regine. These szreements obviously had already |been
presented to the Case Officer who had already conclud that
; LITAMIL-9 could not be moved froma his position. Ths sient
: furthermore, felt that there was no need for training ar S¥
Bince he would be returning to. Mexico after only three jmonths
in Cuba. He displayed a cable he had Just received fram his
‘father answering LITAMIL-9's query as to what might be lhis
next assignment. The cable stated that LITAMIL-9 would mcst
likely return to his present post in Mexico. The teen tetre-
fore felt that upon his return to Mexico City, he could be
‘debriefod by his Case Officer, LITAMIL-9 rejected all attempts
“to convince him of ovr need for current info fron insid Cuba,
He was adanent when wa pbointed out that he might not raturn to
Kexico City as hoped, but might have to remain in Cuba having
no means of contact. If this happens ho plans to rep his
Position and return to Mexico as a private citizen, e@ he
already is a registered “resident” of Mexico. ~

a 3. On Friday, 24 February, PARKERS spent most of
the day visiting alone with LITAWIN~9 at the latter's lapart-
ment, By the end of the day LITAMIL-9 hed softened a little
aod kad revex'ed some of the personality traits montiomed
below. LITANIL-9 also agreed *o communicate with his Case--
Offtcer throves open code in letters to hig brother id Mexico?!
. City. He also was willing to meet inside EUBARK,’ preferably
t if the contact was a diplomat but not Cuban. ile agreed to .
take a set of cuff links as bona fides. As a suggestifon, he
mentioned that his friend, The Swiss Ambassador, vor jserving
in Madrid, Spaia, would be an ideal eontact. In revealing how
euch @ contact could be performed ana in discussing LI/TAMIL-9
modus vevendi ta Cuba, there was considerable discussions
concerning cperational Security and clandestine procedures
LITAMIL-9 c25 apply while in Cuba.

in logical seqence, his reasons for believing that be will
return to Mexico Citw. Ranically. he facia that hetwoen the
fact that he has many contacts in Mexico City (where Ne was
lived and worked for many years) and the fact that hils sister-
in-law in Cuba has a responsible position with considerable
influence in the Castro Government, he LITAMIL-9 wil] [be re=
assigned to his present post in M.-xico City after three months
of leave,. consultations, and training in Cuba.

5. The third meeting ocurred in the evening of

25 Februar., in a car pick up situation, with the Cad Officer
present. This time, LITAKIL-9 was Jess willing to conwnicate
with KUBARK while in Cuba than he had been during the \previous
meeting, but with some reluctance, agreed to the use of open
code and to b= contacted by some diplomat. This meeting, there-

fore, was a routine operational meeting, with his Case Officer
in charge. :

. 6. Based upon their three neetings, PARMERS formed

the following opinions of LITAMIL-9: He is a shrowd oppor-

tunist, willing to colloborate with KUSAR% against the Castro
Government, but not to the point where his personal s curity

iw endangered. He dislikes the Castro Regime because jit has

fumbled go bad'y, and because the current Cuban officials are

crude and. incompetant. He greatly admiros the American people, .
but definitely. feels that we are merely concerned about our :
own vetions! security and well-boing. LITAMIL-9 owes bis.
first loyalty to the fine arts, has little Patriotic fleelings
towards Cuba. since he bas lived in Mexico for so many) years,
and bss declared himse}f£ to be a resident of Mexico. He is
now serving tre Cuban Government simply because he had an
opportunity (through his sister-in-law) to achieve official
Status and income and. still remain in Mexico where most of his

.

~ Nore
_48=

Personal friends reside.

7. Although et first appearance, and according to
his own opinion statemeats, LITAMIL-9 appears to be exztr ely
nervous because of his clandestine activities in behalf of
KUBARK and against Cuba, after some discuss:on jt was spparont
that he actually relishes these clandestine actions that lhe
would have angaged in then long before he did, and that he
would have continued a covert relstionship with KUBARX even after
Castro falls, serving either in Mexico (wher: he has mas:
contacts of inter-:st to KUBARK) or in Cubs ia some post in
some future government. He has excellent rssport with his
present KUBARK case officer. He states that as long as KUBARK
remains willing to accent that he has definit? personal Jimi~
tations, (since ke can perform only those clandestina tasks
related to his cover and cannot be trained or induced toldo
anything eJse) he will gladly continue collaborating with
KUBARK as long as desired.

8. Actually, PAPWERS feels that LITAMIL-9 would
do most anything we would desire if KUBARK would someday
establish some control over him. His preseat remarks co: cerning
his moral qualvs are artificial. He has gr apnreciation
for shrewdness ead double play, and openly 1 ts haviag

2 lite. On many occesi he edmits|that
he has accomodated himself to a situation for profit ite

he. knew that he could turn the tables eventually on his ad- .
verssries. When he is off-guard he admite to being 2 cod]

operater who can scheme and work behind his adversaries’ backs.
He shows many signs of enjoying doing what he does for and
with hig present KUBARK case officer,

: 9. Io summary, although LITAMIL-9 did not sccept
training or SW in the standard sense, PARMERS believes that the
agents reluctance was based on his desire to take few ri kes.
The agent 18 competent, his moral inhibitions are probab y
faked. He is convinced that he will return to Mexico in, and
desires to continue serving KUBARK if no greater risk ts /in-
volved, Since ZUBARK at oresent has no clear. control mae

or ideological) over LITAWIL-9, it wap difficult to impose
KUBARK's will over him. But he is very willing to perform for
KUBARK within the limitations he g2ts, and tf womeday we jcan
Satisfy some personal need he might have, ke has the pot jential
of becoming a good contro) led agent for XUBARK. He is intell-
igent and by nature he. seems to instinctivety conduct hig
clandestine operations in a secure manner.
