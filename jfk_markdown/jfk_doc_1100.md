A Yes, and I really can't recall some of the other
people. We were ~~ we nad just moved the Station at that time,

A Sanchez was.,in the Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

Cuban military-type.

Q Was it your understanding that the Agency had receive

instructions with respect to this activity from another

component of the Government?

A Well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether
they received instructions. I have to assume, and I am pretty
positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.

Q Do you know whether or not they consider him an

established contact?

A No manner.

Q Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A L can't speak to that but the records that we have

don't reflect.anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file
they would have to coordinate with the Latin
American Division before they did anything since we do hoid
the file.

Q Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?

A A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any
information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Q Personnel or personality file?
A Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
(0) Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

A Well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.
9 Do you know whether or not Mr. Sturgis ever partici-

pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

As f£ recall, we employed Martinez around 1961,

Q -~ that would be considered covert action?

A well, as I say, a lot of propaganda, press placement, |
media placement. It has been so ‘long ago I really don't

remember. I know we had a number of things going against him.

We used suasion, moral suasion, otherwise. We did some

extra-legal things. We tried to get to his sources of supply,

particularly when they were countries that we had treaties
with, NATO countries, Canada, this type of thing.

2 Let's talk about each of those in turn. You said

you used moral suasion. What kind of activities are you

referring to? -
A. Well, in the moral suasion field we -- actually, we

{

hrase it, but we operated under the Cuban access control \
P * 1

\

regulations of the Treasury Department, the Trading with the

Enemy Act, and we also used the facilities of the Department of|

Commerce, the Export Control people.

I. guess as you are aware, Cuban industry was totally |

U.S.-oriented. As parts began wearing out and this type of

thing, Castro had his little people there running around trying

companies. Where
we would find this out through all-source intelligence, we

or the Treasury people or the Commerce people would go to the

real tumble and all of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.
It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn!

want him to get the exchange, So it was those types of

activities.

Q Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen or U.S.

companies enlisted in that effort?

A Oh, yes.

2 In what manner did you use U.S. companies and
businessmen?

A Well, we simply used them as the experts. A great

many ~~ the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the
American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything wnen they had to pull out. Sugar is the

lifeline of Cuba as far as any exchange, foreign exchange, this

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother
ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in-to

much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out
because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type
of operation that we did.

own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And. we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.
The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

Q And what kind of facilities did the Station have in
Miami? Physical facilities.

A Well, they were located on the south campus of the
University of Florida, I mean, the University of Miami, at
the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained
unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn
well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the
Dixie Highway inland. We had our own guard force.

Q Non-official cover. What was the cover?
A It was a commercial cover. It was called -- the first
one was called Zenith Corporation and it was set up with a

President and Vice President, normal corporate setup.

Q Engaging in any business?
A No.
Q Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community,

how long could a non-official cover last?
A Well, obviously it didn't, but it was research
activities. Funded -- it:is a giant mechanism when you put

one of these things in for the funding and this type of thing,

Q Yes, I understand.

A So it was a research activity and’ the only people that

ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You
know, somebody would make an inquiry, you know, we can't accept
any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this

type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And.out of.
this. one: thing, of course, then we were running these innumera-
ble-éther™covers with different activities. The guard

force, of course, were like -- well, they wore uniforms, simila
to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think
that there was -- in the later days at that site I think the _
Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other

Government agencies, in other buildings, of course.

Q And this particular Station, then, was under the
supervision of the group we have been discussing?

A Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

Q When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume
responsibilities for the Miami Station?

A Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the
Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western
Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

9 Is there presently a Miami Station?

A Oh, yes. |

Q And how large is it at the present time?

A Well, since we -~ I think when we closed down the
Cuban Operations, I don’t know how large it is at the present
time because we are in one of these periods: where’ we -are
reassigning people, but I think by the end of this fiscal year
there*are going to be between 11 and 14 people.

Q When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions
were being performed by the Miami Station?

A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I
think I have lined them out at:one time --:- collection of
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this
type of thing. Covert action.

Q This is the list of things you gave me earlier in

the deposition?

preliminary interrogation of these people they had to. fill

out forms, where.were you born, this type of thing, biographic+

Miami Station . Do I understand that the Miami Station was the

largest CIA station in the world?

A. The largest CIA station in the. world.
0. At its height?
A. Nothing comes anvplace close to it.
0 I wonder if vou could describe briefly for the record
were,
A. Well, the AiOTS were Cuban a Cuban intelligence
organization in exile. We full intended -- this was part of the

overall contingency pian that US Government had. Should Castro
ever be overthrown, these people would be the nucleus to go into
Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

‘0. Now, Ministry of the Interior, is that a euphemism
for Security Agency?

A. Well, in most countries of the world the Ministry of

Interior, unlike ours, is the security force, internal and.

A Right.

0 These people were fulltime CIA employes, weren't thev?

A. Right. WE11, let me -= these people really were -=

they were being subsidized by the Agency. They: were employed
bysitvorcover:companies, the largest of which was called. Latin
American’Social. and Economic Research. Then we had another
smaller qroup that did the interrogating and they were under
‘another’ cover, commercial +cover, -- I just don't recall what it
was. But these peop.e ostensibly were employees of these wholly

A. You mean in terms of vears?
a Yes.
A. Well, I would think that I would probably say from

about 1962, and I think the debriefings as such, of course --
we relied principally on the airlift for the people coming out
and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did ~=- cut off
about, I quess about 1970 or '71, in that timeframe ~~

0 I see. : ; :

A -- that stopped the flow of the refugees, so we just
terminated that part of the activity.

0. ‘Well, in addition to debriefing refugees that came

|
in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any other

intelligence gathering functions --

A No.
0, In the community? ~
A Well, I can't give you a real ves or no-to that. I

would suppose: that: there is'an'outside possibility: they could
have been used to debrief people within the community, within
the Cuban community, but we had in the organization -- all these
people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an
On-Site Case Officer, who was'a fulltime: staff-emplovee and he
had a couple of assistants, including a secretarv. These people
were directly under his control. Though the organization as it
was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,

but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Officer.

whether thev are on an island or perhaps other places, their

names turn up on manifests and this type of thing. Well, these

are put into a machine system. What we did when these cards

i were all transferred back here in Miami, we did go through them
at random and pick out cards and then try to match it up with
what the machine svstem had to see if there was updated informa-

Government allowed a lot of this to go on for awhile but I guess

about 1965 or 1964 they got a little tired of it and they

I am sure the AMOTS were in part responsible for proposing

alerting us and in turn we alerted the enforcement agencies when
there was going to he a raid against Cuba by one of these
militant groups. A number of times raids were aborted, picked

A Well, oriqinally they were set up to assist with the |

“AS we phased down the maritime activities, they were made
available to intercept Cuban communications, NSA‘ tasks’ them with
the*frequencies they wanted covered and the Cuban Communications
nets: they wanted covered, such as the border guards. Another
important one was the sugar network. We had the border guards,
sugar, transportation, maritime. I think there was an interior
network they covered too, But all electronic intercept coverage

is. dictated by NSA.

A. NO. I really wouldn't know, but the relationship was

a two-way street. It wasn't simply that we assisted these
people as well as they were assigint us.

2 What assistance would you render for members of
the press in Miami?

A Well, in the case of the Latin American editor
we would put him in contact with the Chiefs of Stations of
areas he periodically visited and the Chiefs of Stations
would give him background briefings and this type of thing
on che developments within a given country.

Q Was that done evenhandedly for various newspapers?

A Predominantly, I would say prebably the Miami
received probably a little more attention than.the
other papers, principally becauseyit was a large paper and

their Latin American editor traveled a great deal throughout

the Hemisphere.

2 Was he also used as a source?
A No.

similar briefings?

What kind of an investigation have you conducted?
A I have talked to people, which is really all you

can do. There is no other way you can do it.

authorized this activity? Jave you been able to identify

any of the persons who participated in the picketing?

A No.
