CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

d. Of the Buller group, which was called the "127", about ® prisoners wore
taken, five of whon, including source, were sot free. One of these was
an infiltrator oslled Flores, whom no one trusted since they knew that,
be wav not "one of the group.". Another of these was Rolando Valdes,
‘Dtiolf who is now in prigon in the ‘Fortaleza de la Cabasia serving a nine+~
yoar. sentence. He was captured trying to escape in a cer celonging to a
militiaman and wearin, a militia uniform. He defended himself bravely, but
received five bullet wounds which incapacitated him. The other two who
wero released were Eduardo Diaz Lanz and Jorge Crus Pejia, a sergeant in
the Rebel Amy who was with Castro in the Sierra. Tho letter hud actually
not been involved in the groups Source thought that he (source) and Diaz
Lanz were released so that they mi¢ht be followed and lead the Government
.to other groups and individuals in Havana who might be involved in
resistance activitys Source had deen -in prison six months tefore being
released, and one thing which he could not explain was that on the: ‘paper
that he wae given which indicated. his release, no mention was nade of any

Sentence or penalty.

On several occasions, Muller had been subjected to false execution

procédures, with the purpose of trying to make him talk, out he did not.
- weaken. During the trial, "everyone remained rirm," and zource was told
that. Muller wae very brave in his pronouncements against the Hegime and,
at every moment, abided by his principles. He presented a very. brilliant

self-defense.

f. When source was in the Boniato prieon, he shared a cell with a Captain
An{bal Rodr{uez, who belonged to the AHR. Thie officer, along with other
rebel officers and soldiers, had’ staged an upriving in inlas, in Oriente
Province. Later he was sentenced to deati and shot.

During his last days in Cuba, source avoided all revolutionary activity,
since he wanted to leave Cuba more than anything else. However he knew
that the various resistance groups worked hard, oarrying out a great deal -
of independent sabotage activity, although there was ‘not mich coordination
among the various: movements. One movement whioh had-a. large membership,
especially in Orients Provincey:was the 30-11. This group was planning to
launch an insurrection in Pinar del Rfo in January 1962, but they could
‘not carry it’out-since the repression in the area was so greate .

Be

\ be Hans, a momber of the Revolutionary Student Directorate, was recently
taken prisoner, and it seemed that he was tortured a yreat deal and
talked. As a result. of thie, a house in ajay, in Havana Province, was
seized and arms and gelatina wera found. The owners of the aouse and other

“persons yere arrested.
