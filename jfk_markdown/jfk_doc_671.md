Required: FYI.

OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY

A. Preparations vere underway in early November to
dispatch AMTRUNK-13 to Madrid in mid~Novenber to cement
the recruitment of AKTEUNK-19. These plans fell
through when the Madrid Station notified Headquarters
and WAVE thet their workload would not allow sufficient
case officer time to handle AMTEUNK~13 in Madrid at this
time. WAVE agreed to postpone ANTEUNK~13's trip to
Madrid several weeks until Madrid Station's workload
abated somewhat.

B. The prospects of finalizing the recruitment of
ANTRUKK~-19 increased however with the receipt at WAVE

of another open letter from AMTRUNK-19, this one

mailed from Mexico City in mid-November. 11 ANTRUNE-19'g
first letter, mailed from Nontrenl in mid-October, he
suggested using a friend in Nexico City as a cut-out to
initiate a channel of communications between himself and
ANTRUNE~13. In his second letter, AMTRUNK-19 stated
that be had made the necessary arrangements with his
friend in Mexico. Although WAVE, Headquarters and VEX
traces on ANTRUNE~19's friend, IDEN A, were fragmentary,
Mexico Station stated that IDEN A vas well-known to one
of its PBRUMEN assets who vouched for IDEN A's loyalties.
WAVE intends to send an innocuous letter to AMTRUNE~-19 in
ANTRUNK-13's handwriting to keep the channel with 4-19
alive. AMTRUNK-19 appears eager to see ANTRUNK~13 again
and has stated in both letters that he has considerable
information to discuss in detail. It is well realized
that this open letter channel ia far from ideal but it
is hoped that in early January 1965 ANTRUNK-13 can re-
contact AMTRUNK~-19 and provide hia with a system of S/t.

MHAPHOM requirements upon bin.

C. In mid-Novenber after the postponement of AMTRUNK-13's
Madrid trip, preparations began to launch Operation
PMTEEEE XY in car’y Peceaber. This operation sould attexpt
to re-organize the ratline to and from Havana and the
ANTRUNK infil area for the future use of infiltrated
MHAPRON recruiters and other agent assets ag necessary.
Secondary objectives are to bring into the tufil area

a@ cache of weapons and explosives for AMTRUNK-10/AMLASH~1
and to teach a system of S/W to one or more assets in the
area. The team is to be composed of the same four individ-
uala who participated in Operation ANTEUNK 1X in October
1964; AHAGRKE-1, Team Leader; ABAKA-1, Radio Operator;
and AHTRUWK~16 and -20, Guides. It sas decided tv sheive
the V-20 as the Intermediate Craft (IC) for this opera-
tion and substitute a 17' Johnson boat with twin 75 hp.
outboard motors which could maneuver through shallower
water and which could be more easily camouflaged. The
basic reason for this decision was the fact that Decen~
ber through February are the low-water months in the
AMTRUXK operational area. During this shallow water
season, the heavier, wider Y-20 can only be used in the
daecper and sore heavily-guarded infiltration canals.

D. Through the combined efforts of AMICE-14, the AMTRUKK
P/A, and AMAGRER~1 and AMAKA-1, four radio operator
candidates, to be trainod for future use in PH opura~
tions, were recruited during the reporting period.

B. Recruiting for MHAPRON infiltration candidates con~
tinued during the reporting period. One prospectivo
Anfiltree was recruited during the month of November

and the case officer was active in assessing and debrief-
ing two other candidates. It is hoped that by Harch 1965
one or more of these candidates will be trained and pre-
pared for infiltration for clandestine MUAPRON recruit-
ing. Ip lerge measure this will depend upon the success
of Operation AMTRUNK XK in re-organizing the ratline to
and from Havana.

F. S/®¥ Weesnage No. 13 was sent to ANTRUNK-l1 in response
to his Nessage No. 15 in which he stated that both OWVL
receivers were now in his possession. ¥AVE Measage No.
13 to AMTHUNK~11 gave directions for the disposition of
the OWVL receivers and the activation of OWYL contact
with both AMTRUNK~-11 and ANTBUNK-10.
