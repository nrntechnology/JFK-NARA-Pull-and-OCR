1, Subject seems to havo inherited thet particular
Latin American peacnant for involvenent in covert political
activities. However, the Sudject's involvement is not merely
pectina ar varvestion but it is inetand inttmarely coannacted
with his chosen srofession as an arms salesman. Here the
phrase "for fun asd profit" seems aptly suited. He seems
to be a man of sstion with the ability to exploit an oppor-
tunity, rather tran a towering intellect.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Rolando MASFERRER, Jr.

1. Please be informed of a possible future contact~~Rolando
MASFERRER, Jr., recently promoted to Vice-President of Sales, Mili-
tary Armament Corporation, Washington D.C, office, 905 L' £nfant
Plaza, #4020. He is also associated with Parabellum Corporation,
another military weapons firm, Subject, born approximately 1945,
ip Habana, Cuba, is believed to be a naturalized citizen.

2.. Subject makes frequent sales trips to Latin America, Because
of Uho matuve of Lis wala pacducl machine piotvls will odicucuio, Uc

has good access to top Latin Anerican governmental officials and
military and security officers, He has personally met many Latin
American presidents. He should b2 a good soure: of information on
the current status of arms sales in Latin America; internal security,
military armament levels, order-of-battle, and internal politics in
host countries; and, if needed, status of Cuban exile movement. He

is presently on a sales mission to Colombia and is scheduled to return
in mid-June. : “.

3. MASFERRER, Jr. has been a Miami resident since 1959 and more
recently lived in Atlanta. He will permanently locate in’the Washing-
ton, D.C, area when he returns from his Colombian trip. -

4. Subject is not to be confused with his father by the same
mame, the infamous Rolando Arcadio MASFERRER y Rojas (2011-42669).
Masferrer Sr. was a former Cuban Senator and leader of a dreaded .
private army of Batista enforcers called "Los Tigres(Th2 Tigers)".
He is presently serving in a U.S. federal prison for attempting

. to organize a 1967 invasion of Haiti in order to set up a base

of operations against Cuba. Masferrer Sr., violently anti-Castro,
was involved in numerous Cuban exile Operations against Cuba during -
the last decade. .

5. I was Subject's Commanding Officer in the Florida National
Guard and sometimes saw him socially while in Miami. Although Cuban ~
by birth, he now feels that he is an American. Politically anti- 7
.Communist,ne joined the National Guard(while not under duress from _
the draft) to become a "Green Beret," He is polite and correct in.
his social relationships. I received a lctter from him, 7 June 1972,
informing me of his impending move to the Washington, D.C, area. He

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD #10804 16

SUBJECT: Assessment of Recruitability - Rolando Masferrer, Ire
' “Vice-President, Sales, Military Armament Corporation
and Associated with Defegse ystews—Inctorporated ————

fsevea.

. Subject seems to have inherited that particular ~

: Latin American penchant for involvement in covert political
activities. However, the Subject's involvement is not noreiv
paetimea ae cecresticn Sukt ik as ansceaa intimately connected
with his chosen profession as an arms salesman. Hore the
phrase "for fun and profit" seems aptly suited. He seens

to be a man of action with the ability to exploit an _oppor-
tunity, rather than a towering intellect.

-- -' 2. Subject has excellent contacts end access in
Latin America, This access developed from his extended

for hin (although it also closas others). It should aiso
be mentioned that his fanily has recently developed a rather
checkered association with this Agency. The particular | [
nature of his military products gives his contact with high
-military, police, and security officials throughout Latin.

Anorica. He seeus to be well versed on the status of various

aras deals (both official and under-the-table) in the
countries he travels. He has been involved with several
Cuban exile political and para-nilitary organizations.

? ~“politfeally, Subject 1s a staunch anti- Communist.
This: eesteten is pro ably ngrained from his family, but
also reinforced from his various litieal and professional
activities. He has voiced a particular hatred for Cuban a
Communists. He seems to view thed not as respected enemies, - an
but as hated traitors. is-vehomently anti-Castro. 00

as a certain patriotis: for this country. ring conver-
sations he referred a few tines to ‘my country” meaning
the U.S. J believe that .the fact he volunteered fer U.S.
nilitary training reflects not only the selfish notives

enpty. loquacity but is evidence of hfs cesire to contribute
somcti:ing and beccne involved in the national interest.

respénsibility of any Agency association as well as subse- .

6. TI am sure that the Subfegt is recruitable. The
question is what degree of asscciagion with the Agency

would be appropriate. If the 4ecigion is made to approach
the Subject, nay I suggest that hig association be initially

his-trips to Latin America. cace his reliability is established
and the accuracy | of his reporting is proven then further

utiifzation may be pessible. Since his financial situation
seems to be secure T am sure he could be handled on a non-
pay. basis.
