that the nillitary service sd had not been verified, In talking about this
matter with Mr, Sidels.i asked if he would request MMPD, possibly through
SUING BERK s@rycant to : seant or colonel to colonel whether the matter
could be expedited, He ‘assured me he would give this-an albout try and
greed to let me know during the forthcoming week, ,

: .

2. In checking this morning I find that Mr, Sidel-is out on leave
and. going into tralning for at least the next week: In asking how to wet
in touch with Mr, Sidel, eventually Mrs. Suse = cme on the Hne,

She advised that nothing new was in the record and there was no info

on the verification of the military service and wished to assure me that
just because someone Went on leave or wag out that a case was not dropped,

T asked then If any affort has:been made to contict MMPD. She said the
file didn't reflect anything and agreed to check MMPD and let me know,

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT
SUBJECT: Cover Agent Jeremy K. BENADU¥

During the past three months I have kad the opportunity
to work with and direct the activities of Jeremy K. BENADUM,.
Within a few months he will be retired from furiher service
and it is appropriate now to review his past performance ~
and presont status in ordor, that this remain a permanent

Part of his record.

BENADUM, during: tho past ten years, Has performed as
tho outside case officer for the LITEMPO Project, Ile was

pressod into service after resigning his position with

LNERGO, for whom he worked for a period ct twerly years.
Mis. primary value to the.Station, at that tine, was his

uccess tu persons of all-levols within the Mezjcin Covernment

and especially the Mexican Security Service. On further
investigation it became clear it was hif cluse personal and
official relationship with LITEMPO-1 which offsred him this
access across the board. Gradually over the geurs he
dovotoped a similar relationship with LITMH0-12, LITEMPO-4

and others.

: Wis past evaluations are still valid, huwsver, during
the past three months he has gradually been phased out of
liaison contacts and has been used principally to assist the
Station in its orderly liaison transition. He is currently
in touch with two liaison types officially but oceusionally
soos others on a purely social basis.

Although his retirement is not voluntary, hie hns good-
naturedly assisted the Station in this very sensitive and
delicate changeover. Ne will remain in Mexico after hia
retirement and has offered his assistance if needed. He’
presonts no overriding handling problem, reports promptly and
does a good job in submitting his monthly accountings. -

SUBJECT: Asscasment of Career Agent, Jeremy K, BENADUM

1, Pscudonym and salary: Jeremy K, BENADUM, G15, $14,055,
2. Division or Staff and city: WH Division, Mexico City,

3, Operational duties: Subject caintains unofficial lfaison
between the Station and a Mexican Ministry, He also develops
independent agents,

4, Cover: Subject has Inmigrante-Rentista status which allows
him to remiin in Mexico indefinitely and the only restciction on
his activity io that he cannot be gainfully employed, In view of
the fact Ke 1s a wealthy wan in his own cight and will soon be of
age to collect retirement from his long service with the FRI, this
cover presents no problems, After five years in this status he will

. obtain inmigrado status which will give him complete freedom of

operation, with #11 the cights as a Mexican citizen, except that

of voting, The cover is excellent because it ig secure, allows him
complete mobility, and cequire no administrative support, ‘here are
no existing or anticipated probleus related thereto,

5, Diviaion's assessment: Sudject is an experienced, well~
trained, sertous intelligence officer, capable of spotting, assess~
ing, recruiting and handling agents, Most of his experience and
capability {a -in the tfeld of collection of FI intelligence and
operational support, the latter being his most outstanding area of
contribution to Station objectives, He would also be capable of
Tunning CI operations, His knowledge of CA type work, however,
cannot be assessed at Headquarters,

Subject's cover is a natural one and poses no difficulties,
Since Subject has been in the intelligence field for over 20 years,
he is psychologically prepared for his dual role in intelligence
operations and is well qualified to operate without strong Station

Support,

Headquarters is not in a position to comment on the timeli~
ness or quality of his operational reperting, but no defects in this
brought to the attention

y.
S

regard have been neted nor have any
of Headquarters by the Station,

Subject needs no training,

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNKSS NKPORT
SUBJECT: Cover Agent Jeromy K. RENADU

During the past threo months I have had the opportunity
to work with and direct the activities of Jeremy K. BENADUK.
Within a few months he will be retired from further service
and .it is appropriate now to review hia past performance

.and present status in order that this remain a permanent

part of his record,
BENADUM, during the past ton yours, has performed as

‘the outeide cass officer for the LITEMPO Project. Ho was

pressed into service after rosigning his position with
LNGRGO, for whoe he worked for a period of twenty yoars.

- Hig primary values to thé Station, at that timo, was his

access to persons of all-levels within the Hexican Government

“and especially the Mexican Security Services. On further

investigation 1t bocame clear it waa his close personal. and
official relationship with LITEMPO-1 which offered him this
access across the board. Gradually over the years ho

developed a similar relationship with LITEMPO-12, LITEMPO-4

and othera,

His past evaluations are still valid, however, during
tho past three sonths he has gradually been phased out of
liaison contacta and has been used principally to assist the
Station in its orderly liginon transition. He 1s currontly
in touch with tve liaison types officially but occasionally
sees Others on a purely social basis.

Although his retirement is not voluntary, ho has good-
naturedly assisted tho Station in thia very sensitive and
delicate changsover. ie will remain in Moxico after his
retirement and haa offered his assistance if neoded. He
Pregonta no overriding handiing problea, reports promptly and
does a good job in eubattting his monthly accountings.

PERSONALLY-OWNED QUARTERS

Because of the number of tnquires received regarding personally=
owned quarters, the following memorandum which has been sent to
a number of posts may be useful as a guide to our policy. on the
subject:

. : When an employee occupies personally owned quarters his SF-1190
4 should show in Section 21 (5) the initial purchase price as
. shown by the deed, Section 21 (6) (7) and (8) should show
: annual rates for utilities as authorized by Section 132.5 of
4 - the Standardized kegulations (Government Civilians, Foreign
: Areas), ‘These are the only ‘tems of cost to be considered,

: When ‘the quarters ‘allowance system provided for reimbursement

A - »-.for quarters costs within a predetermined maximum, the reyulations
\ : provided that the allowance for personally owned quarters should
yo not exceed 10 percent of the purchase price, converted to dollars

: at the exchange rate available-at the time of purchase, plus allow-
: ' able utilities, The 10 percent of purchase price was ample to
‘take care of taxes, depreciation; repairs, interest ou investment,
and amortization of the costs within’a reasonable period of time

by U; S. standards, Only light, fuel, and water could be added

in arriving at the allowance. .

Under the current quarters allowance system, it is expected that

the flat rate will be paid unless the authorizing officer believes
it necessary to-reduce the payment under Section 134.2 of the
Standardized Regulations, The employee in personally owned

quarters would be treated the same as any other (except that

he cannot receive advance payment of quarters allowances under
Section 113 of the Standardized Regulations). This makes
unnecessary.a special rate for personally owned quarters, The
requirement to report the purchase price on SF-1190 is to pro-

vide- the authorizing officer additional information to be considered,
together with any other pertinent local circumstances, in deciding
whether reduction of the allowance is necessary and, if so, how
‘much, Only the utilities costs are to be vonsidered in addition
to the purchase price except in those rare instances’ where land
rent ts involved, Because of varying conditions between posts

and individuals, {t was not considered advisable to specify any
certain percentage of the purciiase price that Should be considered,

oo

In addition to the information on the SF-1190, the authorizing
officer should consider local circumstances, which vary greatly
from post to post, in deciding whether the occupant of personally
owned quarters should be treated any differently than the employce
in rented quarters and receiving the flat rate allowance,

3. BENADUU was able to ertablish a system whereby persons
ef A{ntsrest to FOrIRH residing in PURUKEN may obtain Mexican ontry
.Visas- without tho long dolay usually required.

4. BENADUM writes well and has improved considerably in
providing information bo obtains from his contacts in written. fora,
Usually, the reports. he submits need little editing in order to be \
processed for dissemination. . 1

5. This Officer speaks fluent Spanish which enables him to
.communicate with tho persons with wham he meets in a free and easy
manner, This ability certainly has assisted BENADUH in establishing ,
the rapport and canfidence so necessary in working with Latins,- \
especially those ‘working for the host government. .

-O 6. BENADUM presents no overriding handling problems for hia

Station Case Officer. He is willing to work long hours, reports

promptly. and does a’ good job in submitting his monthly accountings.

Based upon the Regular Fitness Report systen, this Officer could be
rated as STRONG in judging his performance,

7. BENADUM is the only other Station Officer besides the Cos

_ who has good and ready access to various personages within tho: |
Mexican Government. With the departure of Willard C. CURTIS, the
value of BENADUY to the Station should not be underestimated, !

8. BENADUY was shown this evaluation in draft forn. :

SUBJECT: Involuntary Retirement

. 1. A desk officer from Headquarters visited the ux loo
Lr City Stetion during mid-November, 1958, While here, the visiting
- officer talked with the writer for &pproximably one hour regarding
' the operation of the Litempo projeot and writer's plans for the
‘future. The following points were discussed:

oo (a) The fact that the project was cons fdored to be an
important and successfub one, . .

. oo (b) Writer was specifically asked if he had any plang
for an early retirement. writer replied in the negative. The
visiting offiner indicated complete satisfaction with writer's
_ desire to continue in the sarvice, and noted that 1t would de
‘particularly important in View of the upcoming change of Nexican
administrations in December, 1979, and tne necessity of kesping
the projeot functioning at its current level of offeativensss,

; (oe) When the visiting officer asked whether the writer
hed ever visited Headquarters during bis career with the service,
and found that he had not done S0, the officer asked whether .
weiter could arrange to visit. Headquarters for a week or ten days
during hia next home leave, which would take pleoe in August, 1969.
Writer indtosted that he would be most pleased to do BOs :

26 Based on the foregoing, writer made Plans to provead to
the United States on home leave tn early August, 1969, to return
in mid-September, 1969. Sinoe suoh matters cannot be handled on
short notice, writer has already ranted a house in San Franaisoo,

California for the period in question,

3e This 1s where matters atood, when, on 7 April, lest,
writer was sdyvised that he would be retired, effective 30 June,
1969, 1n aecortance with various ahanges of polloy. He gas also
asked to confirm in writing that ho is in accord with the plan.
to place him on retired otatus as of 3G June, next, |

illegible.it might be, 18 on the wall, and, that if the desision
. has already been mde to retire him involuntarily, then retired he
. will be --= involuntarily, Little as it may matter, writer desires

It is a scureo of great satisfaction and pride to the
writer to have known and worked with a truly great American,
Sr. Allon W. Dulles, whom the "San Franelsaco Chronicle” (generally
a hostile oritio of the Agenoy) described posthumously as
*..Tha most creative, powerful and eminent U.S. intelligence
officer of modern times", And, &8 one's career comes to a olose,

in WH Division Mexico Branch indicate that BrNADUM owns
his own busineso in Mexico City, ia a member of the Board
of Directors of another business, and spends a portlen of
his duty hours oa these buslhesses. Therefore, it appears
that BENACUM may be receiving cover income which should be
refunded in accordance with hia sontract. In addition, the
question arises ag to whether ACNI\DUM's contract ahould
contain the provision (similar to Douglas J. FREAPANE'S
contract) that he can retain only the first $2,¢0l a year

1. The Station waa surprised to recetve the reference, which
stated that HEHADUM'a Life insurance appLization lind not been received
in Finance Diviston an of 15 el, Recently we reeelved |
dated Lh yung 1962, which requested that the Station collect frum HENADUM

1 the premluns for his life insumnce, and no mention was made of payroll
deductions we had requested in T-2800. Therefure, the Statton col+
tected the sum of $72.00 from B DUM in paysent of 6 months premiums.

: This payment wus forwarded to Veadquartora under HMM-T-25992.

2. No action will be taken by he Station to change BENADUM's
‘fleld allotment until notlCleation is received from Headquarters. It
,Would appear that the eacieot means of now adjusting his pay account
‘would be to refund the pre-pald premiigas and beyin ‘paywwll. deductions
‘for the life Lneurunce. .
