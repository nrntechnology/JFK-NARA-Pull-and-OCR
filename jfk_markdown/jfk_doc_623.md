indefinitely, but in view.of his limitations in a desk-bound
situation and the ‘medical. ‘restrictions, both of which wilk
continue to inhidit his. advance iti his present component, this
supervisor endorses “Mi. Widalgo's desire td be considered for
transfer to another. component, namely OTR (specifically covert
training), where his attributes would likely come more directly
, into play.’ ‘He has the ‘operational experience, competency in a
- foreign Janguage, an outgoing personality, and, experience in
lecturing and teaching.* Finally, regardless of the ‘shortcomings
reflected in this evaluation, the grading officer finds much to
admire in Mr. Hidalgo personally. 7 oe .

*should a “suitable. opéning’ in that field be unavailable, it is

felt there would be merit also in considering Mr. Hidalgo's pe
- other stated interests, i.e., the technical interrogation section"

of the- Office of Security or 00 Contacts Division.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL :

I concur with the supervisor's assessment of Mr. Hidalgo
with uct exception to the statement that Subject works well
under pressure. He is indeed an intense person and, under
“ great pressure, his involvement affects his performance; and even
more important, it has a very bad effect on his health. With —
this consideration noted, the undersigned thinks very highly of
Mr. Hidalgo and would be pleased to be associated with him again.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur with the supervisor's assessment of Mr. Hidalgo
with tea exception to the statement that Subject works well
under pressure. He is indeed an intense person aud, under
‘great pressure, his involvement affects his performance; and even
‘more important, it has a very bad effect on his health. . With
this consideration noted, the undersigned thinks very highly of
Mr. Hidalgo and would be pleased to be associated with him again.
