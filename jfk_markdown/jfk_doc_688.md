PROJECT OUTLINE

1

‘Mexico City, Mexico. ‘support for singleton ‘contract agent
operating into right-wing political milieu in Mexico for
intelligence purposes with some covert action by-product.

2. Objectives
a. Objective The objective of this project is to provide

support for a U.S. contract agent who has access to a wide variety
of right-wing political elements and organizations in Mexico.

b. Conduct of Project The contract agent, LIHUFF/1, was born
in Mexico and has had a long history of business experience in
Latin America, as well as, over the past fifteen years,, in Mexico.
At the present time, he is Executive Director of U.S. Chamber of
Commerce of Mexico City, which gives him a great deal of mobility !
in both American and Mexican business circles. Generally, it is :
from the Mexican business community that the financing and support
for right-wing political movements, organizations, and institutions

manipulation of the economic life of the country, the Mexican
businessmen continue to support right-wing political movements or
ostensibly nonprofit civic, research, and other types of organiza-

their philosophy and taking-action in the politico-cconomic fields.
LIHUFF/1 has natural access through his present position and past
extensive experience in the business community here. Over the
years, as a matter of fact, hs numerous associations with these
elements have earned him their trust and respect. In a vacauon AE :
the past four years he has funded Lic. Agustin NAVARRO Vasquez UFF/
organization, consisting primarily of Instituto de Investigaciones

earned

Sociales y Economicos, A.C. (IISE), "Espejo" (a magazine on
politico-economic affairs), and Movimiento Universitario de
Renovadora Orientacion (MURO, a student organization). Also, he
has handled LICHANT/1 who has a history of, and numerous associa-.
tions in, the Mexican right-wing political arena. These and many
other contacts of this type will provide the basis for his reports
on this particular segment of the political spectrum in Mexico.

the Ministry of Education and other aspects of the Mexican

. d. RMD, This project is responsive to Priority A3d

City (approved October 1963). This priority reads in part:
“obtain Information on the stability of the Government ...
through high-level penetrations and through surveillances and
controlled assets of other powerful political groups such as
the Frente Civico... and through continued development and
influencing of high-level government contacts." As an
ancillary measure, the project could contribute to MHSPAWN
objectives of the RMD under certain circumstances where use
of right-wing platforms ana urganizations is merited.

3. Background,
oa, Developments Leading '.9 to Project,

(1) Mexico, politically, is a country in which, _
increasingiy, a centrist political concensus is developing
based on the impact of education and economic development.
On elther side though of this growing central political
spectrum are extreme ‘left and extreme right wings which are

out of proportion to-their numbers. Political disturbances
and efforts to induce jack of stability eminate in the main
from these two extreme wings. As the centrist force grows
slowly, it is possible and probable. that these two wings will
intensify their efforts and become more and more radical.
The Station has intelligence coverage of the extreme left-
wing, but has neglected the equally. important extreme ‘right-
wing when, in the final analysis, any threat to Mexican
political stability by fomenting unrest and incidents does,
and will continue to, eminate from the right-wing as well as

be pena ten ae Sy

RMD, the long range national policy objectives of the U.S.
toward Mexico are to encourage a stable democratic government
and political environment, then coverage of the right-wing

is required if for no other reason than meeting normal Station
responsibilities for political reporting. HBFINCH contacts
inthis area have been, and probably will continue to be,
virtually nil, ‘In fact, .at present in this area HBF INCH
contacts are non-existent.

(2) LIHUFF/1 was first picked up as a contact by
Station Mexico City in 1950’ after having been a contract
agent for Station Panama City for some three years (while

ever since then. This relationship developed from "contact"

covert action efforts.

b. Prior Negotiations. There have been no prior
negotiations with the Mexican Government, intelligence or
security services, or ODYOKE elements on this project.
LIHUFF/1 has been used in the past, prior to his contract
with KUBARK, as a source by ODIBEX and ODMARK.

: (1) LIHUFF/1 (OA granted on 10 October 1962

soe with no number forwarded to field) -- Subject was born in

Poy oe Mexico, is fluent in Spanish, and is about 49 years old.

me Since World War II, he has been in private business in Latin
America, first in Panama and then in Mexico from 1950 on.
During World War II, he was in Army intelligence in China and,
therefore, had an understanding of covert operations prior to
his KUBARK experience. While in Panama, he was employed by
the Station there for several years " to organize a net
directed against a target of high priority interest", This
association was terminated by reason of his move to Mexico
for business reasons. Although he was in contact with this
Station virtually from his time of arrival in Mexico, he was
not picked up as a contract agent until November 1962. His
cover for his past and proposed activities has been natural:
that of a businessman with a conservative political outlook
and interested in the economic and political posture of- the

Mexican Government. Contact with him is covered by a socfal
oa relationship between his case officer and.himself; this is
ns easily maintained. given the large American community in Mexico
ot City. He hes had no formal intelligence training other than
rat . that he received from the Army during World War Il and on the
° job with KUBARK. Control of Subject is no problem inasmuch
: as he is an American citizen and has had considerable
oo oe = *"™" "experience with KUBARK by now, His motivation is that of an
; attraction to this type of work, being a U.S. citizen ina
foreign area, natural concern forhis business interests, and,
BO . . probably, the compensatory return from KUBARK. He is witting
of his KUBARK association and, aside from his World War tt
Intelligence experience with ODIBEX, in 1961 he had an
intelligence relationship with. ODIBEX which has long since
-* “.. been terminated. a

: (2) LICHANT/1. (OA granted on 22 April 1963,

: but no number forwarded to field) -- Subject is a ver

an conservative Mexican educator and intellectual about ho years
of age. He has alternated between working in various
capacities for the Government.of Mexico and in Mexican le
universities. At the present’ time, he is Private Secy. in Min.of !Ed.,
position which gives him unique access in the government to a
the general fields of education and politics as well as
considerable contact with other influential people in right«
wing circles... He was recruited by LIHUFF/] in August 1962

on the pretext of doing research work and collecting infor-
mation for LIHUFF/1's general use for business purposes.
Subject has natural cover for obtaining: information on right-
wing activities from others due to his long association with
right-wing activities as a student, educator, and government
servant. Contact between Subject and LIHUFF/1 is maintained
under the guise of private business relationship, Subject has
had no intellicence training from KUBARK other than that
imparted by LIHUFF/1 in discussing his reports. There has
been no problems in control since essentially. Subject under-
stands that this is a business relationship with certain
requirements involved for it to be sustained. Subject's
motivation is that of an intellectual ly-convinced conservative
who has common objectives and outlook with LIHUFF/1 on
political and economic matters plus the financial aspect of
the LIHUFF/1 relationship. Subject is not witting of KUBARK
or ODYOKE interest in his activities and reporting. He has no
known contacts with other intelligence or security services,
past or present. --

In the unlikely. event of compromise, LIHUFF/1 could

i a a the extent of the compromise, there would be no repercussion
' . . Snsofar as other operations or activities per se were
Po ee concerned except that there might be some tightening of the
: . general operational climate for a while. If, somehow,
. cee LIHUFF/I's true role were disclosed, he could probably be

: 6. Coordination. : a i

If an official anti-USA atmosphere of suffictent :

intensIty prevalled In Mexico, LIHUFF/1 very aie would te

not be able to maintain himself here, particularly if his i
employment continued in his present capacity. . This,
howaver, Is not seen as anything except a very remote contin-
gency due to the Government of Mexico's dependence on the U.S. -
tourist trade. In a general war, it is probable that LUIHUFF/I | _
would be able to continue in place without too much difficulty | -
and would be witting to continue operating on current objectives .
or to undertake entirely new operations against new targets. %
contact and communications should represent few problems In
Mexico.
