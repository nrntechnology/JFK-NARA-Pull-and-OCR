However, EPD Ge-wany hae advigad OFC that a fora has been deviced to
dotoraine this inforaation and that thio fora was presented to the —
egencios, for thair use, on Decesder 7. They have been asked to report

on all peraons asslated.

(>) Questions What, if any, project exists to reliove TB incidence
agong this group?

Supplesental aid io primarily designed to helz escazces saintain
or recover their hoalth, 411 agoncios know that evidence of poor hoalth,
supported by advice of a doctor, euthorises apecial foot suppleconts.
USEP funds can ond have bown wood to provide better iiving conditions
aiso. The Tolotoy Foundation and AFRF havo apont $7,550.45 on supplo~

Bontal food, including additional food at the trea spcial inotallations.
Ho figures are availeble es t¢ thy exect number of 73 Soviet escapeed who

have boon aoatotod,

(¢) Gueation: How many povple havo recolved jobs through the
efforts of the agoncion?

(1) Through the Kaitooralauutera project, 40 Soviet escapees hava
beon pleced in Jobe and privase houvtng found for 17 of thiu nuabver.

(2) During the recont review of agency casos, a>out 50 Soviet
eacapse0s proved to be omployud. In soce cases, agoncy participation
vas apporont; in othors, not. The deyroos of agency aid in finding
theae jobs gould be difficult to pinpolat.

(3) Theru is aloo ovidence that ZO to 30 oncageas have onlioted
in Labor Sorvicu Conpanioo ao “othor nationalitiou”. Here aguin,
egonoy participation iu difficult to doternine, i

(4) Guantion: Mow pany have been ealgrated through efforts of the

agoncicu?

According to tho Uctuber ruportea, the Tolotoy Foundation haa
obtained 94 vious fur Gocapeen, in addition tv 4}¢ visas under
Section 3(0) of tho DP Act. For tno ruvt of tho rfocai yoar thoy

dut a caapatgn ie now in progress to rebuild the progran.

(f) Quastioa: “what housing projecte have been prosectod?
No further housing projects are contemplated until:

” (1) The “egoney counsellore vieit each family and definitely deters
mine tho problems facing thes, and

(2) Tho present 126 to 146 spaces ure effoctively utilized,

| 13. Guention: Ghat are future plans for the itozs listed in para-
graph 127 .

. Tho fundeauntal shortcouing in tho USEP program to asyiat Soviot

". eacapoos is the fact that the counselling pragrea haa not beea conpioted.
Once this has boen dono, EPD Geraany ent tho voluntary aguncios together
will dovalop a comprehonsive progres fur nooting all of the noedo of
the Soviet group. Thio plan witli undoudtedly include intor ‘alias

in operation. -

2. Incroaged supplemental and 23 fanilios are vioited and thoir
nocda doterainod. Clcso ouporvision will be exarcized tu ansure
that the agencies relate thiv aid to the solution of the fauilies'
probleaa, including health difficulties and housing.

3. All evcazves will te rogistored for eaigration, the oaploy-
ablos enong thea will] be trade-teuted, and arrangecentsa will be
eado to cnoure that the proper vocationai training 4a avellable to
those requiring it. In addition, assistance will bo bxtundod in
cloaring up kugai probloas facud by uscapees which might bar thea
fron rovettlonant, The agencies will bo requirnd to suboit special
reporto on their sotivitios. .

4. Spactal afforto are being cada to revitalise tha vocational ”
training and 1m guoge training preograza. Past experience indicates
that guccese in thiv ondeavor will tu liaited. However, it 1s hoped
that effoctive individual counvelling will eventually induce the
e0cepaed to take propor training.

Dear Mr. Sternberg:

As you might surmise, your organization is well
known to the Agency. Following the receipt of your
letter of 31 March 1976, a more definitive search for
information pertaining to your request was conducted,
No information was located which would indicate that

‘CIA has ever provided funds to the IRC either directly

or indirectly. -I trust this letter will allay any

apprehensions your organization has had in this

matter.

If I.can be of further assistance, do not

hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

George Bush

This. appointment was requested by NYFO as a result of the coments made
by Cumings im referenge MeN. |} oan
2. When we opened the discussion with the statement that we
haa heard indirectly that the question of cooperation with the CIA had
arisen at the ACY) meeting, Cucmings imnediately steted that this was
indeed the cnse, ‘and for-his part, he wished to have no contact at all
: - with our Agency. Invited to- elaborate on his reasons, Cumninss said.it-..
: could be very “embarrassing” were it to become know that he had furnished
information oa Czechoslovak refugees to the CIA. He later stated that it
could be extrenely dangerous for refugees to have contact With the Agency»
_ since if this fact were knew, it could bring -harm to themselves or to
co. their femilies still in Eastern Europe. If he had furnished the informa-
tion-about the location of a refugee to wom hara later canc, it would
cause hin great anguish. -He knew, he said, of an instonce in Connecticut: .
in which a refusee who had coopérated with the Agency was beaten up by
ooo Commrist agents. Cumings did not respond to our invitation to elaborate
on this incident, which ve said was unknown to us. Cumaings said that not
only was ‘he concerned avout CIA activities involving refugees» but that if

to our desire to fave this information on & more, tincly basis than was -
possible with reliance oA TS records. “He also suggested that arrange- .

ontrary, in réspénse to our dircct question, Cimiings said that

the first contact with Cummings was on 11 Sept 68 and the
results of that meeting are contained in wx#677-68 of 11
Sep 68, This was straight-forvard request for informa-
tion on how the US Catholic Conference would handle the in-
flux of refugees. As can be seen from the memo, Cumnings
was cooperative and, in fact, offered more assistance to us
than we later requested. We spoke on the telephone with ~
. . Curmings a few weeks later to soy that, in all likelihood,
- we would only be needing to ask for address information on
° selected refugees occasionally. For this information, he ~
referred us to Mrs, Irene Bilinski. On 12 Dec we saw Mrs. -
Bilinski who wogseouperavive tir furnishing information on
(? a specific Czechoslovak refugee. Upon our return from

Washington in late January 1969, @ number of requests had
piled up and we tried. to: obtain the needed information -
through Mrs. Bilinski. She pleaded that they were very busy,
extremely behind in their filing and asked that we call-on

her later. L

call in this regerd was-on 19 Moy. He said it was a very busy

and he again stated he was extremely busy. We said we did have
one address to ask him about and asked if we might see hin
briefly. He invited us to write him for the information,and
assured us that’ this would be entirely satisfactory. We wrote
on 26 May and he replied the following day, much faster than he
had previously. When we called him on 6 June, he invited us to
meet with him that afternoon, We estimate that we have requested
address: and employment information on about 13 individuals. Since
this is ‘the only data requested from Cummings, we do not under-
stand his statement in reference memo that he had "become con-
cerned over the ‘numbers and types of request." In addition to

supject:. CIA Requests to Voluntary Agencies in New York
tee & OF-/6F
: Anbassador/Grahan Martin has asked me to inform you .of
conversations which were held in my presence by certain:
voluntary agency representatives with regard to CIA
requests for information ‘on Eastern European refugees
‘(primarily Czechs) who have been arriving in the U.S. as”
a result of the Czechos lovak-USSR crisis. The following
information was obtained on a confidential basis while I
. was in New York ghis work to, worl on an unrelated project:
DQ. form, ; - CS
(1) On -May 5, after concluding my. own pusinde LF a
cussions, Dr. Ja, Papanck, President of the Anerican Fund
for Czechoslovak. Upees).ANCa,r expressed his deep con-
cern over being ‘asked to supply information on the where-
abouts of his former -countrymen. Dr. Papanek told me that
the CIA is checking on 4 large number of Czech refugees,
most of whom have no special experience or qualifications
which would seem to be of particular interest to the United :
States. He knows that.many of these people are being sub-
jected to intensive interrogations which bewilder and 7
‘frighten them, The-procedure was {nitiated last October by }
a CIA man who identified himself as Norman N. Graber. !
. Dr. Papanck receives his requests by letter (he showed me;
. one sample) which simply Lists the names and other basic: |
, data, either immigration number or date of birth. The —
return address used by the CIA is P.O, Box 1294 in Grand
Central Station, CO which Dr. Papanck is to send his reply
that is, the latest U.S. address recorded in his files. -
“Dr. Papanck did not mention a specific number of names
or requests puc he said they are growing and he is very —
uncomfortable about it; he does not want his: good name or
agency to become identified with the CIA. He indicated,: ; L-
in addition, that the method of operation secms heavy- po
handed in comparison to that of the. FBL, whose agents
present themselves in person, make their requests known

“numbers and types of requests. He suggested, as did
_ Dr. Paparex, that INS might be the proper contact point

At one point the meéting went off-the-record to hear
from Mr. Cummings of USCC, who had been assigned to study

the 'CIA problem," But Chairman Schauer opened the dis-
cussion by announcing rather mysteriously that he had

been: in touch "with Washington" at the appropriate level --

implying that the Council should at least table the matter
for the time being. Mr. Cummings then moved thac (a) there
‘would be no further discussion of it, and (b) ‘each volun-
tary agency should deal with the CIA as it sees fic on an
individual agency basis. His motion carried and the
Council proceéded to other business.

u with my personal preblers, put since I don't -
know vhat to do under the present cixcunstances I an bessing you for understanding.
As you know I always. bsd- trouble. with"the other side”. I¢ somebody vorks in this
field be mot ve endangered after 6 certain time. I believe. I told you about the
calis in Russion and about the spies who are constaatly. around me since about 1951.
J am used always to be on the alert and to look around me cerefully, this ie the
only thing I can do, .In addition to that I bought a dog in the summer of last yeere

Bince about four months the atteupts of the Eust to sat have increased. IT had
several rencontrey with then and nave inforned the police, But singe wo have 50
many people here in Berlia who have good reasons to feel endangered they cannot
watch everybody constantly and the persor in question is more or less left to

his ovn messureo.

Last Wednesday night I ran into a gituation which would have meaut the end for ne

“$f a friend of mine had not happened to be vith me. This way they did not dare to
D lvays walking alone; and cars and helpers

disappeared (not around), I heve reported ny situation again to the police, they

promised to do vhat thay can,
that mikes qt ao little nore darficult for then

Witn friends who work in the same Pield and who knov about these things I bseve
worked out the folloving: I must sell my dog and buy a sharper One. When I bought
bin in July last year the situation was completely different. I did it merely a3 .

a@ measure of precaution, not because I had proofs of the danger I was Living under.
For this purpose he is good but not for the purpese for which I need him now; ha

ig not sharp enough. They have already calculated ry dog into the plan. I
absolutely need another much sharper one. But I mst tell you frankly that even if
I sell my dog I vould not be able to buy the nev ona, vecause they ere terribly
expensive. Then I have decided that I cannot 60 to the office and come home alone
anymore. I can move from one of my frienis to the other for a certein tine but

not constantly. A friend of the Comittee will pick as up every morning and vring ™
home at night in his car. ‘In ‘the meontine I’
vho bas an office car and arrange with her that her driver pick me up. But this
will take somo ting; until I have reached her and discussed the matter with her.

Please don't believe that I a3 hysterical, on the contrary. But now it is so that
I not only feel endangered but I have knowledge of their intentions end I an

sure I would not get out again, once they have bad hold of me.
‘Cordially yours,

/s/ Gisela
