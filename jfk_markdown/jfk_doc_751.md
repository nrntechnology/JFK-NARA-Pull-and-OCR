FOR YOUR INFORMATION

boc. micro. sea.

i. When Wallace A, GROVERY met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January~
1967 to formally terminate the AMWORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1
. discussed in detail reference dependents who had been ‘receiving
* financial ussistancé from ANTCRLD funds and requested that
GROWERY explore the possibility of WOFACT financial assistance
following termination of ‘their AMWORLD monthly support payments.

determine ‘if the agents named dy AMBIDDY/1 had been employed by
WOFACT..in order to determine what, if any, obligation might
exist to provide financial assistance to the dependents. The
results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to .
reference dependents, are Sumzarized below-for Station Manegcua

information,

CIDEN-A). Subject was a FOFACT agent under contract. Ris
MOC provided payzent. of his $400 monthly salary to”
his dependent Frreats for two years following pos-
Sible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission,
After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received
his -regular. monthly salary until 28 June 1963. At
that time Headguarters decided to liquidate the
remaining balance of $6400 and paid this emount in a
lump sum to the Parents. Headquarters considers that
all legal and. xorai obligations bave been discharged
and is not ‘inclined to assume’ any further financial
obligations to the Parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently
unaware that the parents have received approximately

$10,000 from worscT.

CCOMECTECC Cr eas

(IDEN B) Altbough IDEN C, tho husband of IDEM B, was never
directly employed by SOFACT, IDEN B receives $175
pet month as a dependent HEROES/MARTYRS widow under
the AMBUD program nnd hos been paid n total of
$10,850 \from arch 1962 to date through the
DMAVE/AMBUD cover mechanism, Presumably AMBIDDY/1
JS unaware that this dependent has been receiving
regular AMBUD assistance in addition to the $125
per month received from AMWORLD funds,

CIDEN D) AMBIDDY/1' provided GRGERY with the complete nane
and detatia of the activities of IDEN D's husband
prior to his arrest and subscquent 6-30 year pri-
son sentence, With this information traces were
run on Subject. with negative results. Since neither
JMWAVE nor Headquarters records produced ‘any evidence
Subject had ever been a WOFACT employee, no obligation
exists to provido financial assistance to IDEN B,

2. Although reference indicates the discussion between Janes
D. ZABOTH and Ernest|A. LUSBY took place after AMBIDDY/1's conver-—
- gBation with GROWERY tn January, it is not clear when, or by whon,

» the Bubject was originally. brought to ZABOTH's attention, If
AMBIDDY/1 was the aource of ZAROTI's Anformation it 1s noteworthy
‘that he apparently neglected to mention his prior detailed dis-
cussion with GROWERY.. | : . 7 '

3. Under the circumstances, it is not possible for Head-
quarters to take any action. to provide Support to these individuals.

Several individuals who were tnvelved with AMLEMON-1

who was executed as a result of his participation in

the sabotage attompt,. MENDEZ~iiid’ CASIELLES, the Subjects ©
of Case #99, were also executed on the same charges,
RODRIGUEZ was sentenced io 30 years imprisonment which
is boing served in the Islo of Pinos Prison, : :

' The Trustee describes himself, in tho HEW Survey
- form, ay a former employee of tho Cuban Electric Company
and a friend of the Subjects of Caso #99. He is montioned
in a 26 September 1962 AMOT. roport (AA-812; UFG-01672,..
12 Oct. '62). as residing in Miaml where he receivod
lettors, containing information, from source Martha RAMOS
Castro. in Havana, Traces, show-RAMOS to bo the wife of
Armando RODRIGUEZ and the sister-in-law of tho widow of
Julio CASIPLLES,..The trustoo stated in the HEW Survey
form that: one year previously he forwarded tho accumulated
funds and started sonding $33,00 each month to RAMOS in.
Chicago, per instructions by the CASIELLES widow, and that
in May_1965 hé stoppod sending tho $33.00 paymont for the
. MENDEZ: widow to Cuba and Started holding it for hor, He
claimed to have $165.00 on hand at time of ‘the Survey.
-It°is noted ‘that JMWAVE records contatn no mention of
Payment on benalt of Armando RODRIGUEZ. The Payments on
bohalf of LE SANTE, MENDEZ, and CASIELLES appoar to be
banéd upon lettors from the COMANDO ELECTRICO DE LIBERACION
which are tncluded with tho AMTIKI attachment. -

In view of the Case #99 widows being in Cuba,. and -the’
failure of the trustee to Provide’ the oxact date-of-birth
for the widows in his 9 Devember 1966 reply to AMTIKI
(UFGA-26626, 15 Decombar 1966), it is not believed that he
would have the needed documents, We ave, however, through
AMTIKI~1 requesting tho trustee to provide an explanation
of his handling of the payments for. both widows, and, via
his meuns of communication with them, to obtain the required

- documontation,
c. Logality of marriages:

None of the widows/wives who provided information for

‘SUBJECT: Review of Certain Hero and Martyr Case Files

The -"Heroes.a:nd Martyrs" cases were not considered-under
the same regulutions as the dependents of the invaders of
the Pay of Pigs. The‘persons suposed to receive payment
were ‘destgnated, in some cases by "the Department" and in
other cuses by the C.R.C. through its executives. There .
are caseo in which a written memorandum was given to us but -
there are others in which no memorandum was given. We were -
“instructed. to ‘pay-no more than $175.00 monthly to each, and
as it-cun be .seen, .miny cases are receiving lower amounta
and never the amount of dependents was taking in considera~
tion. There ts only ong case recelving a higher amount,
Mrs. Hilda KR. Carballo {widow of Jesus Delgado), :who. receives
$250.00 becaune wea were specially tnstructed to pay. thig ae

Artime stated that the purpose of his visit was to expresa some pere

fact that the Cuba: exile looks at his homeland in a manner quite different
from ‘ie United Siates. Government with Its world-wide responslbilities.

« Nevertheless, he thought it important that hit-and-run raids be resumed
against Cuba to (1) xeep up the ‘hopes of the Opposition inside the island
and-(2) force Fidel to Maintain a high stato of alert which materially, —
subtracts from his ‘economic efforte. Artime noted that assets ‘to make -
these raids-are available but are not being used. He did not’ specifically 2

ask for support to resume hig activities. . ve

I told him that while his arguments had: certain marie, there were also *
other considerations which should be kept in mind, -[, @., that hit-and-run

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Wil/Cuba
‘SUBJECT : Recommendations Concerning Payments to
: Dependents of Brigade Members

-/1. A review of the existing files fails to. reveal |;

any evidence of.a clear-cut policy: concerning ‘the. duration
> Of ‘payments to dependents of Brigade members killed, ;
|. captured or missing in action despite the many reconmmenda- .
“tions made-at various times to resolve this. probles. This
lack of policy is ‘implicit in a memorandum from Mr. Helms |
- to the DDCI dated 23 May. 1962 itn which he referred to a
Presidential oral directive that ‘payments to dependents
were to be continued until termination by. Presidential _. |
order. A later ‘memorandum from Mr. Helis ‘to the. DDCI, dated
,31 December 1962, contained. F commenditions for terminating -
these rionthly payments. with a lump-sum d ‘th payment to  -
“be “made. to dependents of -thosé-killéd.or missing: in action.

30th, memor _are.attached’ for-your ‘review: | .A memoranda D
from Mr. Sterling Cottrell to the Attorney General, dated |
1. February 1963, concerning various agreements: reached
between Brigade. leaders, AMBUD and. the Agency, also included

payments of $122 or more (depending on rank and length
of service) for as long as the widow survives and does
not re-marry. This, Mr. Cottrell pointed out, would be a.
costly program to administer and would cost roughly $300,000
a year for an indefinite period. (This has proven to be

true).

to. a flat $100 per month and all minor dependents reduced

to $25 per month with notification. that all payments will
coase 6 months from date of initial reduction. All secondary
dependents,. such ag deperident parents who receive separate

“any. benefits from the money paid for their support. In

these instances payments to trustees should probably be
