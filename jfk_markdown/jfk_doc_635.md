I. INmopuerrcHu

. This review presents the facts and observations which bear
on the bona fides of the Soviet defector Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO.

The highlights of NOSEiKO's bioyraphy, as he has given it to _

CIA, are as follows: He was born 230 October 1927, the first son
of Ivan Isidorovich NOSEXKC, shipyard worker who in i939 was to
become Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding. After Graduating in 1951
from the Institute cf International Relations in Moscow, where
he specialized in international law and the English language,
NOSENKO entered the Chief Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the
Soviet Navy, serving first as a translator assigned to the intel-
ligence staff of the Seventn (Far Eastern) Fleet and then as a
senior translator and political officer at en intelligence unit
of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet. In mid-March 1953,.. immediately
following STALIN's death, NOSENKO left the Naval GRU to-become a
junior case officer in the ¥CB. He was assigned to-the U.S.
Embassy Section of the American. Department, KGB Second Chief
Directorate, from 1953 to mi@-1955. During this pericd he was
initially responsible for operational activity surrounding Am-
erican journalists in Moscow and later for operations against
U.S. Army Attaches at the-Fmbassy. When transferred to the newly
organized Tourist Departmernr of the Second Chief Directorate in
1955, NOSENKO had as his targets vi_itors to the Soviet Union
from the United States ana the countries of the British Common-
wealth. Having handled a number of successful tourist opera-
tions, NOSENKO in 1958 was promoted to Deputy Chief of the
section responsible for operations against American, Eritish,
and Canedian nationals. Eighteen months later NUSENKO returned
to the U.S, Embassy Section as its Deputy Chier. Between January
1960 and January 1962 he was second-in-charge of all KGB activ-
ities against the U.S. Embsssy in Moscow and personally super-
vised operations against the Embassy Security Officer, the
Second Chief Directorate’s most important counterintelligence
target at the time, and against American code clerks, collec-
tively the Directorate’s most important recruitment targets.

At ths-e0d Of December 1961 NOSENKO again was transferred to
the*Tourist Department, this time as Chief of the American-
Britisn-Cahadian Section. Six months later he was made Deputy
Chief of the Tourist Department, and in mid-1963 he became its
First Deputy Chief,

From the time he first contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962,

_ NOSENKO's status has been under examination. Only nOW, three

years following his defection in February 1964, is definitive
study of the bona fides question possible: the voluminous and
diverse reports by NOSENKO, coupled with collateral information,
required that much time for assimilation, correlation, investiga-
tion, and evaluation. NOSENKO's own testimony, interspersed with
representative’ subsidiary cases stemming from or related to his
reports, constitutes a large part cf the evidence. This review
also draws upon statements and actions by other Soviets, colla-

tions with materials from other sources, and opinions by special-.

ists of various kinds. These factual elements are. presented
without comment or interpretation, except in the penultimate
section of the review where the evidence on the bona fides of

Ti. “SUMMARY OF CPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS |

‘A. ‘Introduction

tt Prem tho CIA side, the KOSENKO case can be divided into
three periods: the first Geneva phase of June 1962, the second
Geneva phase of January-February 1964, and the post-defection
handling of NOSENKO from Fetruary 14964 to date. The rest of.
Part II is separated into these three periods accordingly.

F
Be First Geneva Phase (June 1962) ~ |
t

< . The NOSENKO case opened on 5 June 1962 in the corridors of
- : the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations Dis-
armament Conference. A then-unidentified Soviet, known to him
by sight from conference ncetinys,. approached U.S. Foreign Ser- 4
vice Officer David MARK with the suggestion that they get to- :
gether for a talk the following day. In the late afternoon of
6 June, the same Soviet motioned MARK aside and said that he
would like to taik to him privately as soon as possible. He |
'
}

told MARK that he was “not going to pump him for information, |
‘but simply wanted to teli him seme things." A luncheon meeting
was arranged for 9 June, alchough the Soviet clearly preferred

an earlier date. MARK advised CIA of the appointment, explain-
ing that he thought the upproach so unusual that it might be '
an offer of cooperation or defection. He said he belicved the :
Soviet to be Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO, a member of the Soviet i
delegation to the arms talks. i

At the 9 June lunchecn with MARK, NOSENKO told MARK that

he, NOSENKO, was a KGB ccunterintelligence officer sent to

Geneva to ensure tha security of the Soviet delegation. He knew . }

that MARK had previously served in Moscow and believed he wat

connected with American Inteiligence.* He needed approximately

900 Swiss francs immediately to cover KGB operational funds which

he squandered on liquor and a prostitute in Geneva, and he offered

for this amount to sell txo pieces of information to American i

Intelligence. The first of these was the identity of a former

U.S. Emsassy employee in Mcscow who was a KGB agent anf, as of |

1962, was “near ciphers” in the Washington area; the second was
the identity of a Soviet in Mosccw who, although ostensibly a
CIA agent, was actually planted on American Intelligence. Al-
though NOSENKO at first told MARK that he would stop at the sale
of these two items, he later stated: "I know you won't let me
alone now." At another point NOSENKO said: "I will not work in
Moscow, but I come cut about once a year." NOSENKO also gave
MARK a brief chronological account of his personal and profes-
sional past. MARK explained™that although he was not an intel-
ligence officer, he could place NCSENKO in contact with the
Intelligence Chief in Geneva later that same day.

officer of his financial difficulties and repeated his offer to
io? "3; gell two items of information. He said that the need for money
* ? was his immediate motive for contacting CIA, althcugh in the en-
- $ guing discussion he said also that he was dissatisfied with the
; Communist regime in the Soviet Union. NOSENKO emphasized, never-
: theless, that he had no intention of becoming an American agent--
‘ this was to be a one-time transaction, and after that he would
have no further contact with CIA,

: Despite this original reticence, NOSENKO supplied consider-
' able biographic information on himself and also discussed in
"general terms certain additional KGB operations as well es KGB
organization and operational methods in Mescow, He understoc:1. in

NOSENKO met CIA representatives four more times in Geneva
in June 1962. alwavs in the same safenouse. With the second
meeting on 11 June. his initial reservations disappeared almost
entirely. He answered most questions put to him on KGB organi-
zation and operations. most of his information peing concerned
with the Second Chief Direccorate. responsible for counterintel-. :
Jagence and security within the USSR, NOSENKO seemed to be what |
he claimed to be: a KGB officer in 2 sensitive position with j
knowledge of important KGB operations. .

NOSENKO returned to Moscow on 15 June, having promised to
ao everything within the limits imposed by personal security con-
siderations to collect information of interest; the areas of CIA
interest had been outiined to him, The only restrictions he
placed on his cooperation were his absolute refusal to permit
operational contact with him inside the USSR and his request
that no mention of nis collaboration be made in correspondence
to Moscow. He promised to notify CIA. via an adéress he was
given, when he came to the West again.

had brought a large amount of new information, much of it in
scribbled notes, on KGB operational activity collected in the
18 months since his last meeting with CIA. Twelve more meetings
were held in a Geneva safehouse over the next twelve days, vary-
ing in length from one and a half to six hours. oe

D. Post-Defection Handling (February 1964-Present

: On 4 February, four days before the date tentatively
selected for NOSENKO‘s defection, he reported that.a cable had-
been received from KGB Headquarters ordering his immediate re- |
turn to participate in a KGB conference on foreign tourism to

wee ithe Soviet Union.*.. Exfiltration plans.were,.then-impiemented pose
= “NOSENKO was driven across the border to Germany that same -

night. Debriefings resumed in a Frankfurt safehouse. The de-
. cision was reached on 11 February to bring. NOSENKO to the :
.. 1 United States, and in the early even..ng of 12 February he and
* . his CIA escorts arrived in Washington via commercial aircraft,
cuits .s thence to a safehouse in the Washington area.

At the request of the Swiss and Soviet Governments, NOSENKO

met on 14 February with representatives of their respective

. Washington Embassies in the offices of the U.S. Immigration and

a Naturalization Service. He told both that he had defected of

: his own free will after careful consideration and that he had no.
desire to return to the Soviet Union. In angwer to the questions
of the Soviet representatives, he orally renounced his status and

‘ rights as a citizen of the USSR.

CIA completed its initial debriefings of NOSENKO on 18 Febru-
ary, and on 24 February he was introduced to representatives of
the FBI for questioning. At about the same time, there was a
marked decline in NOSENKO's discipline: He became evasive and
uncooperative, refusing to answer some of the questions of his
debriefers, both CIA and FBI; his nightlife.in Washington and
nearby cities was punctuated by drinking bouts, crude behavior,
and cisputes with his security escort. He explained these
actions by saying that he was under great tensicn as a result of
his defection, abandonment of his wife and children, and the
disgrace that he had brought to his family name. It was against
this background that CIA acceded to NOSENKO's demand for a vaca-
tion. On 12 Maren, therefore, NOSENKO left Washington with a ;
‘CIA case officer and two CIA security guards for a two-week .
vacation in Hawaii. There his behavior deterioriated still fur-
ther: He drank heavily and almost constantly; he engaged in
sexual acts with a number of prostitutes; he was loud and crude |
in publ'c places; and he spent money extravagently ($800 on :

t
i

one prostitute) and conspicuously (a $100 bill for a restaurant
+i
tip). .

Janta eatlbtia alba se

During NOSENKO's absence, cdnsultations were held with
the FBI concerning steps to be taken to restrict his movements
and activities. Both agencies feared that his behavior would
bring about unwanted attention and publicity, perhaps police
arrest, and that doubts about his bona fides, which were be-
coming known to a widening group of people in the U.S. Govern-
ment, might be inadvertently revealed to NOSENKO himself. The
. FBI on ] April said it would “not interpose objection" ‘to ‘the }
: CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's freedom of movement. The Acting
' Attorney General, the Department of State, and the White House
; were also notified of the CIA pian at this time.

"reacted significantly" to questions concerning his intentions
in defecting to the United States and other related matters.* -
He was then told that he would remain at this safehouse, which
thenceforward was his regular place of residence. Since this.
time NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been
under full-time guard, and has not been permitted access to
news media.

Detailed interrogation of NOSENKO was begun on 4 April 1964
in order to obtain information which he had been reluctant to
give in debriefings, and to clarify contradicticns in what he
had already reported. This phase of the interrogations was termi-
nated on 24 April 1964. .

| Despite the searching nature of the questions and the im- '
plicit and explicit doubts of his veracity, NOSENKO proved him- . i
self willing to answer, or to try to answer, questions put to

“him. Because much more information pertinent to the question of :
his. bona fides had to be obtained, a new phase of interrogation
was begun in mid-May 1964. Difterent interrogators were intro-
duced and questioning was resumed in a neutral, non-hostile man-

| ner. The period of neutral questioning continued until mid-Novem-

1 ber 1964.

atten aid Laren thneten tin ne

After further consultations with the FBI, a new zound of :
hostile interrogations began on 26 January 1965. NOSENXO was i
questioned for a total of about 140 hours by individual interro- i
gators and by interrogation teams consisting of two or three , :
men, and he was directly challenged cn many of his previous re-
ports. He admitted that certain of his earlier statements had '
been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions in |

i

his testimony. Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had keen
basically truthful, and that he had come to the United States
solely for the reasons he had originally given. This interro-
gation was broken off on 5 March 1965.

dawentiniadie, Seddtonice ete

and the interrogations of January and February 1965 concentrated
on the period of his claimed service in the U.S. Embassy Section
of the American Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate, from
Ganuary 1960 to January 1962, Among the reasons for selecting
this particular period were the comparatively large amount of
collateral information available against which NOSENKO's state-
ments could be checked; the importance of the U.S. Embassy and
its personnel as.the outstanding KGB Second Chief Directorate
targets; their importance from the standpoint of American .
security; and the extent of NOSENKO's knowledge about the acti-
vities of the U.S. Embassy Section, in his capacity as its
Deputy Chief. .

Questioning of NOSENKO during the summer and autumn of 1964 |

wm retbiBetnusishoon

In keeping with Soviet practice, CIA asked NOSENKO in
February 1965 to sign a series of interrogation reports, so- :
-- ealled "protocols," most: of which concern: the: period of: his on
Claimed service in the American Department. . These were written E
by. the CIA interrogators, and they were designed to incorporate

eo ne oe Te

..-° | WNOSENKO's exact statements and meaning on-various specific sub-

Ts Jects. The protocols were in no way presented to NOSENKO as
documentary portions of a "confesaion,” but rather as distilled
and final statements of what he did and did not knew concerning
particular topics. NOSENKO was asked to read each page of each
protocol carefully and to sign his name at the bottom te indi-
cate that he understood and agreed with its contents; he was ©
allowed the use of a dictionary and was permitted to ask any
questions and make any changes that he wished. (Amendments were
entered by the interrogators and were initialed by NCSENKO.)
NOSENKO was asked, after reading. each page and after completing
the entire protocol, whether he understood what was written there
and whether there were any more changes he wished to make. He
was then asked to sign and date the statement, “I have read and
understood this report and certify it as correct," at the end of
the final page. With one exception, which will be noted later,
he did so calmly and without objections, although oa one or two -
of them he remarked that his statements were presented in such
a manner as to make them look foolish; although invited to do
so, he was not able to suggest any changes of fact or presenta-
tion which would- make them more accurate. Commenting cn the
use of interrogation reports, NOSENKO said on 4 March 1965:
"my life story is absolutely correct. Anytning I have signed
is absolutely correct. I absolutely understand what I am doing
when I am signing any paper. This is an official document, and
I fully understand what I'm doing when I sign it as being abso-
lutely correct."

In May 1965 a CIA psychologist questioned NOSENKO in detail
on his life from birth until 1953, when he said he entered the
KGB, -in an attempt to gain additional insights into his charac~

ter and personality. a
y

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until 14 August
1965 with the participation of Peter DERYABIN, a former KGB offi-~
cer. These interrogations, the first to be held in Russian,
were for the purpose of using DERYABIN's first-hand experience
in the KGB to obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's per~
gonal and professional background. :

: . There were no further debriefings or interrogations until
i 18 October 1966. On this date NOSENKO was polygraphed on the
case of Lee Harvey CSWALD. , .

Po During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was questioned for
! seven days on specific aspects of selected topics ranging from his

§ identity to his involvement in and knowledge of specific KGB opera-

: tions. Questioning was in both Russian and English.

op QEERATIONAL CIRCCUSTANCES

ROSENKO'e nane first came to tho attention of CIA in October

to enter the United States as a member of an automotive delega-
tion. The following month CIA obtained copies of his passport

There was no indication of intelligence affiliation, and when
NOSENKO arrived under true name with the Soviet delegation in
Geneva in Kerch 1962, he was accorded no more than the interest
routinely given by Western intelligence services to Soviets
travelling abroad.* After arriving ia Switzerland, however, but
before establishing contact with CIA, NOSFNKO was involved in

at least two incidents which brought him to the special notice
of the British, Jwiss, American, and possibly the West German
services.

The first of these occurred in April 19€2. At a cocktail
party in Geneva, NOSENKO met a female secretary employed ky the
British Foreign Office. He saw her several days later in the
corridors of the P:lais des Nations and asked her to have dinner
with hin, and a date was made for several evenings later. Ac-
cording to the sccrerary's later account as repurted by her
superiors: "They talked about Marxism, the Chinese, Yugoslavia,
and love; NOSENKO was obviously smitten with her, became verbally
amorous, and told her that he would like to take her off to a.
desert island.’' The girl felt that NOSENKO probably was not
interested in her for intelligence purposes. but seemed to be
genuinely attracted by her. From her conversations with NOSENKO .
she was able to report that "he had been in submarines during
the war and, according to himself, had risen to the rank of
Commander. He was e member of the Communist Party. His father
was in the Ministry of Shipping. We himself had served in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1948 and 1949 and had apparently
visited England but had act been statiuned there.’ NOSENKO
also told her that he was acquainted with Gia WOE of the
fppublishing house tn London.** When NOSENKO became too
persistent in his attestions, the secretary reported the contact
to her superiors, was withdrayn immediately from Switzerland,
and later resigned from the Foreign Officc.

This same incident also brought NOSENKO to the attention
of the Swiss service, which later reported it to CIA, without
details, as an attempt on NOSENKO's part to recruit the girl.

*Although NOSENKO was described in reports (held by CIA) con- °
cerning recruitment approaches to Amcricans in Moscow prior to
His first arrival in Geneva, there was no basis in thuse re-
ports to identify the Soviet described as NOSENKO, The name
NOSENKO did not appear in these earlier reports.

3 was one of NOSENKO's targets during a 1957 trip
to the Soviet Union. NOSENKO used the alias NIKOLAYEV in his
contacts with Sp and, in CIA debriefings, gave this. as the
reason he was forced to use the name NIKOLAYEV in the two trips
he made to London in 1957 and 1959. The secretary knew NOSENKO
by ai name. (Sce Parts V.D.3.d. and V.E.8. for discussion of

NOSENKO's interest in her was not only sexual, but also in
information to which she had access in the course cf her duties.”
A official in Geneva told CIA that ho: KO had definitely
tried to recruit the secretary and that he attempted to cbtain
“disarmament secrets" from her. .

At his seoond reeting with CIA on 11 June 1962, NOSENKO
described the same incident, in the context cf reporting a pos~
sible KGB penetration of British counterinteiligence: "I decided
to try to take this English girl to bed, And this had nothing
to do with work. No, it was simply (sex)...And Yurxa [Yuriy
GUK, First Chief Directorate officer in Geneva] said to me: ;
‘Listen, Yura. Be careful, because we have peovle cven in
biitishccounterintelli,ence.'" NOSENKO described the incident
as follows:

“After I had been here a week or two there was a
reception for members of the delegation and at it I saw
a certain English girl. Then RUSK gave a reception and she
was there again. I came to the reception, she saw me,
and I went up to her. She said that it was very nice to
make my acquaintance, and that's’ all. M.S. ROSOV (TSYNBAL)
was there. He said to me: ‘Yura, it looks to me lixe you
are going to bed with that’ girl." J answered: ‘What do
you mean, Mikhail Scepanovich? She just interasts me.!

I had already decided to try to get ner in led...But,
listen further. After this she used to go to tue Disarma-
ment Conferences. Weii, to make it short, I asked this
girl for a date. fhe is Scottish, Scottish, net English,
and works in an office here. We agreed to reet ata
restaurant. I asxei my friends wiich restaurant here is
the best, where there isn't a crowd. We went to the restau-
rant and sat there al! evening--all alone. ‘ihcre were just
the two of us. The restaurant is under the ground and is
called 'Day and Night' in Russian, ‘Jour et Nuit.’ We
sat there and then she asked me where we could reet ayain.
A day later we met again, Again in the res rant and then
we took a walk. She got me bothered and then gave me the
brush-off. I called her once. She wasn't at home. I
called again, Again she was out. I called a third time.
She wasn’t there. She thought that I was an intelligence
officer and that I was interested in her for this reason.

~ This, honestly, wasn't so. LI had only one thing in mind.
She was quite a woman...But the English yirl felt that
she was being developed. I met three times with her.
Three times we were at the restaurant and she told them
Iher superiors) this. She knew that I am Russian. She
told them this and they [{NOSENKO whistled, apparently sig-
nifying that they terminated the relationship] at once.
She knew from the very beginning that I am Russian, from
the very beginning. In short, I told her a loz of things--
well, you know--so to get her into bed. Well, we were
walking on the quay and I said to her: ‘How about going
up to your place?’ she answered: 'I can't.' ‘Why?' I
gaid, ‘I'll take off my shoes. and come on tiptoe.’ She
answered: 'Is it: possible for me to come to you?' 1.
said: ‘You can't come to my place. There would be a
knock on the door at once. The Swiss would tell the
Americans and that would be the end. I can't do this.'
So all I could do was have her next to the parapet. But
the English felt--and nothing was heard about this, but

asons for NOSENKO's Presence.in Geneva (1962 and 1964) /
1. TDY in 1962

When NOSENKO arrived in Geneva for the first tine on
10 March 1962, he wam listed officially as a Soviet Ministry of
Foreign Affairs "export" with the Delegation to the disarmament
talks, Early during nis second meeting with CIA on 11 June 1962,
NOSENKO was asked to oxplain precisely why he had been sent out

‘to Geneva. He repligt as follows: "Right now, I came to pro-

vide counterintellixence support to the Disarmament Delegation....

_ There is a special [kGB] department for delegations, a special

one, recently created, And-the chief of this department is
simultaneously a deputy chief of the [Second Chief] Directorate.
He is both chicf of the department and deputy chief of the
directorate so that there will be a person vho can be held re-
sponsible if anything happens. Understand? The chief of the
directorate {o.m. GRINANOV| hated to sign all sorts of recon-—
mendations and s9 on, when someone can run off in Belgium or
wherever he may be. ‘This happened more than once, and he was
summoned before the [epsu} Central Committee. Therefore, he
decided to create a now position. ‘Tine person holding it is
simultaneously chict of the department and deputy chief of the
directorate and personally signs off on all matters cencerning

. exits [from the USSN|, ‘This was in order to avoid being called

on the carpet...s0 that blame would fall not on the chief of
the directorate, but on his deputy, who is in charge of this
department and who signed off...

“This department," NOSENKO continued, “is concerned with
departures abroad, that is, it checks all Soviet citizens who
intend to travel abroad, both alone and as members of delegations.
Since GOLITSYN [defected] in Finland, we have an order that no
delegation is to bo let out without an operational worker, not -
a single delegation.,, With me it happened as follows: I was
not planning to go. They told me: ‘You are going.’ I said:
"I can't. I have a nection. I have 15 people there, all
operating people. Am I supposed to dump them? What can I do?!
‘No, you are going,’ was the reply. ‘And what did the chief
order?' I asked. Tho chief {NOSENKO was referring to GRIBANOV
when he spoke of the “chief”.] said: 'GROMYKO is going this
time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs is going, and somebody
on an appropriate level must go with him. Not a case officer,
not a senior case officer, not a deputy, but the chief of a
section, or the deputy chief of a department, or a department
chief." Well, I was the most junior section chief. I was
called in to my chief, my immediate chief, who is concerned
with the Seventh Department. They had told him that it would
be for a month and on this basis he gave me permission. And
I have been here since 10 March."

Later during this second meeting NOSENKO volunteered that
in addition to his sccurity officer functions in Geneva, he had
a@ special assignment to check on P.F. SHAKHOV, a senior advisor
to the Soviet Delegation.* SHAKHOV had been noted in contact

“with David MARK, believed by the KGB to be a CIA officer;
NOSENKO reported, and on this basis the KGB suspected that
SHAXHOV might be an American agest. NOSENKO described the
various ways he had tested these suspicions in Geneva. He
first gave SHAKHOV disinformation and looked for indications
that he passed it on to American contacts. Next, SHAKHOV was
told to perform countersurveillance tasks during & meeting by ~ a
NOSENKO with an imaginary agent, while other KGB officers ,
checked for signs tiiat SHAKHOV had forewarned the Americans

about the meeting. Finally, NOSENKO revealed to SHAKHOV the

location of a KGB "dead drop" and checked back five days later.

to see whether the specially prepared materials which had been

placed in it had been disturbed in any way. NOSENKO's con-

clusion from all this, he told CfA, was that SHAKHOV was ab-

solutely free of suspicion, and it was his intention to report

this finding when he returned to KGB Headquarters. 4

On later occasions NOSENKO reported that SHAKHOV had
previously served with the Ministry. of Foreign Affairs in the
United States and that during this period he acted as an agent-
recruiter for the KGB. In 1966 NOSENKO named one person wh
SHAKHOV had spotted and developed in the United Stated,
; hep SHAKHOV, according to NOSENKO, was not and never

h en a KGB officer. Asked why SHAKHOV was permitted to 4
travel abroad when he was suspected of being an Ancrican agent, 3
NOSENKO explained that since SHAKHOV belonged to the Ministry :
of Foreign Affairs, the KGB could do nothing about his trips 1
abroad. "There was no proof, only suspicions," and furthermore,
SHAKHOV was a member of the personal staff of the head of the 4

Soviet Delegation, S.K. TSARAPKIN. : ty

NOSENKO was questioned again about his 1962 assignment to
Geneva during the February 1965 interrogations. His answers
were incorporated in a "protocol" which NOSENKO certified as
being correct on 26 February 1965. The protocol states:
“GRIBANOV had nothing at all to do with my assignment to Geneva
in 1962. 1 think that the fitness report written about me for
this trip was signed by [F.U.] BOBKOV, since he was the Deputy
Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the
Seventh [Tourist] Department. I did not personally discuss
this trip with GRIBANOV before ny departure from Moscow. My
candidacy for this assignment was supported by [S.G.] BANNIKGV,
the Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, who super-
oo vised the work of the Eleventh [Soviet Delegations| Department

conferences over the years, and he has attended a number of ses- , .
sions of the UN General Assembly. Most recently SHAKHOV arrived aina
in New York as a member of the Soviet Mission to the UN in 1963. ,

The Soviet defectors PETROV and DERYABIN have reported that

“this trip because SHAKHOV, who was. suspected of possibly being.
a Western agent, was to be in the delegation. When the Eleventh
Department was looking for a case officer to make this trip
they wanted to have a chief of section because of the serious~
ness of the SHAKHOV case. When they asked in the Seventh ,
Department [V.D.} CHELNOKOV agreed that I should take the as-

signment. There was no background or neightorhood investigation

conducted on me in connection with my being approved for this
trip.* My assignment was approved by the Eleventh Department,
by the Personnel Office of the Second Chief Directorate, by
the Central Personnel Office of the KGB and by the Central
Committee of the CPSU.” . an

NOSENKO was asked why he had been selected to make this
trip immediately after assuming the duties of the Chief of the
American Tourist Section, on the eve of the tourist season,
and at a time when he had no deputy. He explained that it
was not thought that the assignment would Last so long, and
CHELNOKCV, his superior and friend, had decided to lez him go

as a "treat."

During interrogations of October 1966 NOSENKO was ques~
tioned further about his 1962 assignment to Geneva as a security
officer. He said that in this capacity he would necessarily
know the identity of all other KGB officers serving with the
Soviet Disarmament Delegation in Geneva. There were only,
besides himself, the KGB First Chief Dixectorate officers M.S.
YPSYMBAL and I.S. MAYOROV. (CIA, however, has tentatively
identified three other delegation members as KGB staff officers:
A.K. KISLOV, observed in Washington acd in Moscow in what
appears to have been KGB operational activity; V.G. FILATOV, who
served as an alternate handler in the KGB operation with the
NATO officer Georges PAQUES; and Oleg GRINEVSKIY, a ber
of the permanent Soviet Delegation whot handled a
double agent during this same conference.) NOSEWKO inciuced
GRINEVSKIY in the list of his own agents in Geneva in 1962
and said that, in Moscow, GRINEVSKIY was handled by an offi-
cer of the Intelligentsia and Correspondents Department of
the Second Chief Directorate. KISLOV, according to NOSENKO,
was an operational contact in Moscow of the Austria-Germany-

'.Scandanavia Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate

and was used in operations against the West German Embassy
there. NOSENKO also said that KISLOV had been a KGB operational
contact during his earlier tour in the United States but was
neither then nor later a KGB officer. He characterized FILA-
TOV as a Ministry of Foreign Affairs.official and stated that

he is "definitely not an intelligence officer." :

on his investigation of SHAKHOV.. After saying on the morning
of 19 October 1966 that he had been personally told by the

investigation was the main reason for his assignment to Geneva

in 1962, NOSENKO later in the day stated: "My main task was to~

check the security of the delegation, plus SHAKHOV. You can't
separate these tasks." —

_ In this questioning NOSENKO described the basis for the
suspicions of SHAKHOV, the lack of results from earlier inves-
tigations, and his own preparation for this assignment. He
said that as a representative of the Soviet Delegations De-
partment of the Seccnd Chief. Directorate, M.G. SITNIKOV had
conducted investigations.of SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but
SITNIKOV was unable to resolve the questions concerning him.
Because of the failure of these early efforts, the KGB decided
to send “a senior. guy" to the Disarmament talks in 1962, and
NOSENKO was chosen. "to finish things up." Before leaving Mos-
cow in March 1962, NOSENKO therefore discussed the SHAKHOV .
case with: SITNIKOV and with one (fnu) LYALIN, the Soviet Dele-
gations Department officer in charge of the SHAKHOV case; he.
@lso read various materials-on the case, including an investi-
gative plan drawn up by LYALIN. NOSENKO's description of these
preparations provided the basis for the quest ioiving which
followed:

Question: Why was Stl axHOV under suspicion in June 1962?

NOSENKO; He was working with different delegations at
different conferences and, being in Geneva,
it was noticed that there was something which
can he described as a connection with David
MARK, who was considered a CIA officer.* Also,
little, little, little things before.

Question: When did SIIAKHOV and MARK first meet? How did
it begin?

NOSENKO; In '60 or '61 there was a’contact with MARK.
I don't remember who reported it. The report
was maybe trom SITNIKOV in Geneva. MARK was
known to the Second Chief Directorate as the
Rezident [CIA Chief of Station] in Moscow.
After Woscow he went to Geneva, and it was con-
sidered he must be the Rezident in Geneva.
411 the KGB officers going there were told to
pay attention to hin.

Question: What about the report?
NOSENKO: Maybe the officers saw the two going to the

toilet, Maybe there was.a contact. The file
said "maybe." I was sent to Geneva to carry

*As stated earlier, MARK was not a CIA officer in Moscow,
although he did perform certain clandestine tasks for CIA. He
had no CIA missions in Geneva in 1962, Within the context of
‘discussion of NOSENKO's security officer duties during October
1966, NOSENKO was asked to name any CIA officers he knew tobe
present in Geneva during the 1962 disarmament talks. MARK was

2. The 1964 TDY ‘
NOSENKO's 1964 trip to Geneva, commencing on 19 January, was — 4 ¢
also in the capacity of security officer with the Soviet Dis- q
armament Delegation. He said he was the only security officer ot
for the group, which consisted of about 25 persons, and again 4
he was officially listed as an "expert." NOSENKO reported that 3

he had three or four agents within the delegation and an equal
number of operational contacts. The only person whom he was

instructed to watch in particular was A.A. TKACHEY, an inter- 4
preter, who had travelled to Austria in 1960 ard 1961 and who, :

Other than this, according to NOSENKO, his responsibilities
were general in nature.

NOSENKO explained during the February 1965 interrogations
how he was selected for this TDY. The protocol he signed on
26 February 1965 states: "GRIBANOV hac absolutely nothing to
do with my’ assignment to Geneva in 1964. The fitness report
on me for this trip was signed by [F.D.] BOBKOV. For the 1964
trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of the :
CPSU was required for me or for any other members of ‘the dele-
gation who had been approved for the 1962 trip. It was ny own
personal wish to make this trip in 1964 and I had discussed the
question with [V.D.] CHELNOKOV even in 1963 and had received
his agreement. I had also talked about this with [M.v.]
KHLOBUS7TOV::s and [G.] PANCHENKO [both of the Soviet Delegations
Department]. After it had been decided that I would go, in
about the beginning of January 1964, [N.T.] ZHARIKOV, the Chief
of the Department, suggested that a case officer might not be j
‘required with this delegation. KHLOBUSTROV, PANCHENKO, and 1
[A.G.] KOVALENKO [Chief of the Tourist Department and NOSENKO's
immediate supervisor] supported me for the assignment as a
‘personal favor to me." With regard to GRIBANOV's knowledge pf
his assignment to Geneva this second time, NOSENKO said 'that he A
feared that if GRIBANOV learned about the TDY he would have said, :

C. Motivations and Intentions of NOSENKO

Ln ee ea aL

1. Introduction

_NOSENKO has not indicated that his professional status in
the KGB, his standard of living in the Soviet Union, or his
family life prompted him to volunteer to American Intelligence
in 1962 and to defect to.the United States in 1964. He initially.
told CIA that he had been. unusually successful during his ten-
year carcer as a KGB counterintelligence officer; his closest
friends and the people whom he admired most were members of the.
KGB; he enjoyed his work. The NOSENKO ‘family held a high social
position, and.their economic situation was "luxurious by. Soviet’
standards." NOSENKO described his family life as close and
harmonious. He spoke with fondness and pride about his two
daughters, of his wife's tolerance and understunding, of the
companionship she gave him; He.expressed love and a sense of
responsibility for his widowed rother, who heavily depended
upon him after the. death. of his father in 1956. The elder
NOSENKO won his son's aduiration for having worked his way up
from an apprentice pipefitter in a shipyard te the position of
Soviet Minister of Shipbuilding. The NOSENKO name is hcnored
in the home town of Nikolayevsk, where the shipyard has been
renamed for the former minister and where a statue of him has
beén erected in the town square. By his own account, NOSENKO
thus had had a rewarding home life and a successful and enjoy-

‘able career in the KGB.

‘2. Collaboration in 1962

At the outset in 1962, NOSENKO said he wanted to limit his
reports to two items of information. Before the first meeting
with CIA was over, he went beyond these two items to give de-
tails on the KGB Sec‘ond Chief Directornte and other operations,
and he offered to meet again. (Four more meetings ensued in

1962, with NOSENKO providing additional information on the KGB.)

He would not defect, NOSENKO said, unless his personal safety
was endangered by the KGB. Motivations in coming to Americen
Intelligence, according to NOSENKO, were his financial emergency
in Geneva and his disaffection for the Soviet regime.

a. Readiness to Report to CIA

During his 9 June meeting with David MARK, NOSENKO said he
realized, even before talking to representatives of Anerican
intelligence, that they would not be satisfied with the two

Atems of information alone--he expected them to insist on more.

He was introduced by MARK to a CIA case officer later the same
day, and at the start of the meeting, the following dialogue
took place:

NOSENKO: You see, I am not planning to be your agent...
and don't think that I am going to work with
you in Moscow. No. No...

Case As you have’ said, I am-an intelligence officer
Officer: as are you. And I think that we will understand
one another.

NOSENKO: You want to place our relationship on an agent
basis. : .

Case Of course.
Officer:

NOSENKO: Never in my life 1 will go in contact [with |
CIA] in Moscow or the USSR, never in my life.
I also know about Langelle and POPOV;* I know
this matter.. When it was abroad it was fine,
but when-you decided to meet him in Moscow...
You want more than I came with the intention
of saying... You want to change this to a long~

.term relationship. Understand me. I am now
the chief of a section. Before my departure
{from Moscow] a decision was being reached-~
and I have just spoken with my wife in Moscow--
I am supposed to become the deputy chief of a
department. Do you understand what this is?

Case Why are you telling me this?
Officer:

NOSENKO:; Because 1 wanted to come [to CIA] only for a
business deal, to give you these two cases,
to receive money for this, and that's all.
Goodbye. Perhaps, sometime, when I come
abroad, we will meet one another and perhaps
I will give you someth?..3. God knows. But
I don't want te do this now. I don't want

to and I am not prepared within myself for this...

I am giving two interesting cases. The most
interesting ones. I say to you honestly, the
two most interesting ones. in the first of
then [apRey"*] I took nd part. In the second
[ BELITSKIY***] I took part, even here.

Case I want you to understand that these two matters

Officer: that you spoke to Mr. MARK about are of great
importance to us. But I don't have to tell you
that. You know that. But we are not going to
play like children. You know perfectly well
that it is worth every franc... What I want
to tell you is this: of course I will ask you
more, and of course 1 want to know as much as
you know. If you refuse to answer, that's your
business. 7

NOSENKO: I will tell what I am able to tell. What I
- know, I will tell. Of course, you ycself
understand that there are things concerning our
internal system that I cannot report to you.
You yourself understand this.

ee pe.CIA.officersaid the: he understood NOSENKO had
“been in the KGB since shortly after the war, NOSENKO, without™
>> further prompting gave a detailed statement of his own personal
past and his professional career, In tis statement he described
his education, his service in the GRU, his entry into the KGB :
‘and generally the functions and operating techniques of the
various components of the KGB Second Chief Directorate in which
he had served, along with the inclusive dates of his service
in each. This account was very similar to that given MARK
earlier in the day. Still without prompting, he discussed
several specific KGB operations against Americans inside the
Soviet Union, one involving the recruitment of a Yale University
professor on the baSis of homosexual compromise and the other
an unsuccessful attempt to recruit an American code clerf.”
NOSENKO said he was personally involved in both cases.*

The question of his further assistance was then raised
again: The CIA officer asked NOSENKO to tell more about the
Yale professor, but NOSENKO demurred, stressing that the agree-
ment involved only two pieces of information and ignoring the
fact that he had already given considerably more:

NOSENKO: I have told you enough for this day, and I vill
tell you only these two cases which I wanted to
tell you, and it is enough for this day.

Case How do you imagine that this is enough? You

to be there with my own [people].

This exchange was followed by a lengthy description of the two
leads which NOSENKO had come to sell; the BELITSKIY and the
"ANDREY" cases, *

: As NOSENKO was about to leave this first meeting, his case
: officer asked when they might meet again. NOSENKO suggested
! . that they meet two days later, on Monday, around noontime as
: ‘-* it would be easier for him to get away unnoticed at lunchtime.
He then said that the case officer was probably trying to get
: zo+ +, @verything down on tape and asked that this be stopped because
p of the risk to his secvrity resulting from such a permanent re-
cord of their conversations. NOSENKO said: "I will not tell
you. anything particularly interesting. But I can tell you some~
Poe _. thing. But not today. I can tell how LANGELLE blew POPOV--not
i -.... LANGELLE, but because of whom and why we found him--for your

sometimes voiced moral compunctions, from this point on NOSENKO

rity vis-a-vis the KGB. :

b. Attitude Toward Defection __

od While willing to meet with CIA representatives during
future trips outside the Soviet Union, which ne estimated would
occur about once a year, NOSENKO in 1962 refused tc consider
~ defection except in circumstances where his personal security
would be endangered. Wis devotion to his wife and children. and
the probability that the KGS would take reprisals against them
if he fled were, he said, the primary considerations behind this
‘yefusal. (Without elaborating or the reasons, NOSENKO said on '
another cecasicn that he would not want to leave the USSR even '
on a permanent KG3 assignment and accompanied by his family.)
Other considerations included his widowed mother's dependence - |
|

on him and his love of Russia and the Russian people, as opposed
to the regime. For these reasons, NOSENKO said, he could not
defect as PETROV, GOLITSYN, and KHOKLOV had done.

ce. ‘Motivation : . . Jal

. NOSENKO told David MARK on 9 June 1962 that he wanted to :
contact American Intelligence because he was in trouble over
the loss of KGB operational funds, for which he had to account
prior to his imminent departure for the Soviet Union. His KGB
career would be ruined if he was caught misusing this money,
NOSENKO added, and because he had nowhere else to turn, he was.
willing to sell two items of information to MARK. The amount
needed to cover the loss was 900 Swiss francs, or about $210,
and this was the price asked for the information.

NOSENKO's statements of motivation to his CIA case officers
during subsequent meetings are given below:

. 9 June 1962: In his first meeting with a CIA officer NO-
SENKO. asked whether MARK had relayed the reasons why he wanted
to meet with American Intelligence. He then very briefly re-
. peated what he had told MARK concerning the loss of his opera~
tional funds. The case officer remarked that there must be ‘
something more to it, upon which NOSENKO said that this was not,
in fact, his main motivation: "I have been working in this
business’ for a long time and I know what I am doing. I have
heard more than is written [in the newspapers]. A reorganization
has been started in the USSR. In short, they have begun to do
away with the ministries and the sovnarkhozy. But this is pre-
‘mature. Right now our agriculture is falling apart at the seams
and our industry is at the point of collapse because this re-
organization, this innovation, is too early. And this is not
just me, a young man, talking. I mingle with ministers, with my
father's friends, and I hear what they are saying. ;And how much
_ does a worker earn? 600-800 rubles in old money, now 60-80.
“And he doesn't sense any improvement [in his position] within the
total population. These are empty words only. We have exceeded
. the United States in per capita production of butter and milk. .
But how can it be said that we have surpassed you when they are

for what has happened to me. This is perhaps the incident that

drove me into contact with you. It all somehow grew within me.

God knows."

li June 1962: During the second meeting, NOSENKO himself
raised the issue of motivation. His case officer had just said . i
that CIA would respect his wishes in connection with a particu-
lar request when i30SENKO said: "Speaking of respect, how can
there be respect? I don't even respect myself for what I have
done. But, but, take the press bulletin, the communique of . :
the Summit Conference in Moscow on various questions. Again . ; :
lies, lies, lies, to show that we have had great successes. I
can't see them [the successes). No, excuse me, I know somewhat
more than the rank and file Soviet man because I work under this
System. I can see what is“ being dene and what is not being done.
Lies, more lies. This was my mood. I say, ‘How much is it pos-
sible to deceive the people, the Soviet peopie? How far can
you go?’ Our people are very poor. It is somewhat difficult
to arouse a people such as this. If we stir ourselves up we
will know how to stand up for ourselves. But I feel for my
people. How often can you say that things will be good; how
often can you say that we have achieved big successes? Where
are they? Show me them, I can see no trace of them. This is
what I say...that there is resentment in my soul. Do you under=
stand? A terrible resentment. I love my country. You may say
that this is nothing. But I tell you that I cannot act like
GOLITSYN, like KHOKLOV, like PETROV, because I want to be there.
I want to be with my family. That's all. But I feel that not
only the government is making mistakes. I feel that there are
faults throughout the entire system of socialism. ‘hat I mean
is ‘that things are bad in Czechoslovakia, things are bad in Po-
land, things are bad with KADAR [in Hungary], they are starving
in China. This means that there are great mistakes. Well,
that's all. What did you want to ask me, please?"

At the close of this meeting, NOSENKO stressed that money
was unimportant as a motive for a continuing relationship: "My
name must not be used anywhere, even in your offices. Understand?
It would be the end of me. I am not afraid of this. The devil
with them. Because I have had such a life. I lost my father,
everything. Why do I say this? I did not come to you simply , tear,
because I needed money. I don't need it. I came because I am
resentful inside. Do you understand this internal resentment?
I do not believe in what is being done. I do not believe-in
this. Listen to me. Let me speak honestly. Have I not had the

sions. What do, I want to say? That I've never wanted for money.
Never...As I said, perhaps the thing which drove me to you was not
. Money, but this: great, great resentment.”

14 June 1962: The subject of motivation was not discussed
curing the third and fourth meetings with NOSENKO. As he was
about to leave the Geneva safehouse after the fifth and final
.session, however, NOSENKO again touched on the economic inequi-
ties existing inside the Soviet Union and raised a new reason for
cooperating with CIA,. his basic sympathy for. the American people.

“NOSENKO said that he realized that the reason he had given for

_ coming to us, his need for money, was "not good." Before he
and his case officers parted, NOSENKO said, he wanted to em-

' phasize "without attempting to justify himself" that he had
"always felt a certain sympathy toward the American people.” He
explained that it was not the technical progress of the United
States which attracted him, nor was it the high standard of
living of the American people. It was rather the openness and
directness with which the Americans whom hz had met and seen
handled themselves. As examples he cited his American targets
in Moscow and Secretary of State Dean RUSK, whom he had seen in

. Geneva, ’ . i

Although NOSENKO did mention the difficult economic situa~
tion in the USSR on a few other occasions, he did not relate
these remarks specifically to his motives for volunteering to
CIA. The above excerpts are representative of his total state-
ment on motivation during the 1962 meetings.

3. Decision to Defect (January 1964)

On arrival for his first meeting with CIA during the second
Geneva phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that after long
on and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting series, he had
* decided to defect. He once again criticized the Communist regime
along the same lines as during earlier meetings, but his immedi-
ate motivation seemed to have nothing to do with this. NOSENKO
explained that he had recently been promoted to the position of
First Deputy Chief of the Seventh (Tourist) Department of the KGB
Second Chief Directorate, and that because of the stature and
responsibilities of his new job, there would oe *-w opportunities,
; . (if any, for him to visit the West in the future. Therefore, he
poe had decided to seize the opportunity at hand and to flee to the
i ' * United States at once, leaving his family behind. He foresaw no
possibility of his wife and children being permitted to leave the
USSR for the “next twenty years." NOSENKO told CIA that "the
hardest thing is to part with my family." He had, however, care-
. fully considered their fate as the close relatives of a defector,
i tar. . gd he knew that, because of his mother's position in Soviet so’: :
‘ ciety, no harm would come to them,

. Whereas. NOSENKO declared his intent to defect immediately,

the CIA case officers at this first meeting in 1964 persuaded
him to remain in place for at least two or three weeks on the
grounds that, first, CIA would benefit much from this; and
second, arrangements for his transfer to arid reception in the
United States would have to be coordinated in advance with CIA
. Headquarters. soe : : .

would be able to give CIA leads and assistance in spotting and
recruiting other Soviets.

The next five meetings with NOSENKO were devoted exclusively
to debriefings on the activities of the KSB Second Chief Direc-
torate. Althorgh his impending defection was mentioned, his
reasons for taking this step were not discussed. In the mean-
time, NOSENKO's first CIA handler flew to Washington for dis-
cussions regarding the defection and, on his return, told
NOSENKO that the CIA leaGership had asked why, specifically,
NOSENKO had decided to come to the United States at that time.
The answer was that NOSENKO, "after coming back and seeing that
there was no more chance to come to the West, or littie more
chance," felt that this was his one opportunity to come and make
his iife with the Americans. Therefore, he was going to seize
the opportunity while he had it. Asked about this, NOGSENKO con-
firmed that this was his reason, and added: “I may never have
another chance, and in addition, I've had sufficient time since
our last meeting here in Geneva [1962] to weigh everything and to
consider everything." Later in this same meeting, NCSENKO again
mentioned his lack of interest in money and his feelings about
deserting his family: "I understand [that it will be difficult
to adjust to a new life in America} and know that for some time
I will be sick within. And I know that a certain pericd of
time must elapse before this can heal. I even spoke to you
bluntly about my [financial] security. I am absolutely un-
mercenary and have never had any appreciation for money or
wealth...My most difficult and sorest spot of all is my family.
This is the nost basic and most difficult spot of all. And I
know perfectly well that I must go through an illness over
this. For this the only and the best doctor is time. I don't
expect to have a new family there. Of course, I don't know--
but at least I'm speaking from the way I feel now. I have a
strong liking for children--nct only for my own, but for all
children and, losing my own, I am fully conscious how I must
suffer through this. In time I will get used to it. I know
one can get used to almost anything.”

At this meeting, NOSENKO agreed to remain in place for
approximately another week, and the tentative date of 8 Febru-
ary was selected for the defection.

NOSENKO's motives for the defection were not- mentioned
for five more meetings. Then, on 4 February 1964, he telephoned
the Geneva safehouse to say he wanted to defect at once. Ar-
riving shortly thereafter, he announced that he had been or-
dered to return to Moscow the following day and, therefore, had
to leave Switzerland before morning. He stated his reasons
formally in an asylum request, written at the time:

“This decision was made by me, not now, at the : +
moment I write this r2quest, but several years ago.
Having worked for many years in the KGB and knowing

" more than the average soviet citizen about the policy of
the Soviet government, about the direction which this
‘government has chosen to take, and about the law and
order in the USSR, I have come to the decision that

4, Tha Letter of July 1964 °

The most complete explanation given by NOSENKO of his
motives for first contacting CIA and«later defecting to the:
United States is contained.in a letter to his CIA case officer
in July 1964, He described this letter as "an exposition of
all those reasons and roct causes which led to the decisicn
to leave the Soviet Union” and further explained that “every-
thing put down here is lacking in a whole series of lesser

details which to a greater or lesser degree played their

role.“ Nevertheless, he said, he had tried in this letter.

“to set down the main things to show how, when, and why the
decision was born, grew, and hardened within m2 to completely
alter the course of my life." This letter is preserted below
in its entirety. Most of the biographical and operational
details mentioned in the letter are covered separately in other

parts of this paper.

"1, My life, my childhood and youth passed in

very comfortable circumstances since the positicn of
my father gave us the opportunity to live without lacking

foe anything. And the only difficult periods of my

life (before the death of my father) were: study in

‘the naval schools in kuybyshev, Baku and Leningrad;
and the beginning of my working life, the period in
the Far East (1950-1952). The opportunity to be
always well-dressed, to have a sufficient amount
of money, to have my cwn car, to be able to use the
car given me by. my family and also my father's car,
the opportunity to travel to the South and to vaca
tion in the best sanitariums, dachas, and so forth;
all this unquestionably left its mark on me and be-
came something of a habit. After the death of my
father, my successful progress in my work gave me a
higher salary, and although I did not have all that

which I had while my father was alive, still I did not

experience any serious difficulties. But already I
wanted to live still better.

"2. Up to 1953, over the course of my entire
life--at school, in the Institute, at work, at home
in the family--it was always pounded into my head

that STALIN was a great genius, that he was good, keen,
etc., and the thought never occurred to me to question

his words or his deeds because everything that he

. said, and everything he did,were completely axiomatic.
The arrestsand trials only involved traitors and it

was considered and explained that the people whe
suffered innocently, especially in 1937 and 1938,

suffered only because at the head of the NKVD in 1937,

1938, was the betrayor of the people YEZHOV. Not

even the shadow of doubt fell on the name of STALIN.

Soon after STALIN's death in 1953 I read a certain

document given me by my father. This was a secret
- letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the
"case of the doctors;' it was not.addressed to all

letter which described in detail how these people,

. €Ommunists but only to members and candidate members
of the Central Committee. I was deeply shaken by this

dmportant specialists in the field of medicine, were
brought to such a condition that they condemned then-
selves; that is, they confessed to things which had
never happened, to things which they had never done.
They were simply forced to give the evidence which was
needed by. ne ‘Investigators. ~The secret- letters-on— -

—the cult of STALIN and mich that I heard in the KGB
about the reign of STALIN, all this left its mark and
forced me to think deeply about the real truth and to
look at everything more critically. Already I no
longer had faith in all these ideas which for years
had been pressed into my head.

"3. The new leaders (KiiRUSHCHEV and Company)
used the same methods but already diluted with the
water of democracy, with playing up to the people
and attempts to convince them that a new era would
arise, a new and better life, and that now the Party
was always going to concern itself with the welfare
of tne people. In fact, it was a struggle for power
and the use of all. means in this struggle,“even
microphones (they listened to the conversations of
BERIYA and his friends; later they listened to the
conversations of MOLOTOV, MALENKOV, KAGANOVICH, and
others),  KHRUSHCHEV's endless blabbing about suc-
cesses, when in fact they didn't exist, the figures
about how the USSR had. passed the USA in the produc-
tion of butter and milk, when in the stores they were
available cnly infrequently. The endless promises
of a better life when in fact nothing of the sort is
taking place. All this similarly forced me to re-
evaluate not only the events which were taking place
in the country, but already the entire ideology of
the Party, its external and internal course.

"4, The events in Novocherkassk where about 20,000
to 25,000 people rose up and the way in which this
popular indignation was suppressed by troops with many
casualties. This also made a deep impression on me.
When I was resting in the summer of 1961 in Nikolayev,
from my relatives--my father's brothers--I understood
well the real relation of the workers both to the
leadership and to the Party as a whole. at the same
time I saw how the workers really lived, how they eat,
what they have and what they can buy with their wages.

"5. %I heard a great deal from my father about
the domestic policies of KHRUSHCHEV in regard to the

development and the course of construction in industry, °

about his complete illiteracy in engineering techno-
logy and industrial economics, about incorrect deci-
sions in regard to many industries, and this was not
only the opinion of my father, but also of other impor-
tant leaders in various fields of industry (MALYSHEV,
VANNIKOV, AKOPOV, and others). But.no one dared to
open his mouth and when in December 1955 my father
tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain deci-~
sion would be incorrect, he received such a rebuff, _
from KHRUSKCHEV. that he was profoundly shaken and in
the opinion of my mother this brought him to his ill-
ness in.1956 and his death in August 1956. :

“Gn 1956 after the death of STALIN and while I was Cat nee alpaca

* -~<ehe-events in-Germany~and especially... csancow
Bungary showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy =»
of communist ideology. What was especially important
for me was the fact that in these countries it was.

a protest not of individuals or groups, but of the
entire people who could no longer endure a regime
imposed on them by force. Here it is necessary to
emphasize that the life of the people in these coun~
tries was much better than that of the people in the
USSR (I saw for myself how people live in Czecho-
slovakia, in Germany, and beyond any doubt they live
better than the entire people of the Soviet Union).

_ "7, The split of the international communist
movement became for me a clear fact and confirmed
my opinion that the theory of communism is a theory
built on sand and that it is practiced according to
the needs of the leadership of the Party at a.given j
stage of life and that in reality full material wel- ‘
fare would never be enjoyed by the people but cnly
by the leadership and the Party and the government.

“g. Working in the KGB I came to understand
much and became conscious of the contradiction between - 0
the internal and external course of the USSR. Such ;
questions as disarmament, the ban on atomic weapons, the : F
positicn of the USSR in the United Nations--all these ai 4
are used only in the interest of propaganda and as
a screen for carrying out of the policies needed by
the communist party. (I was myself present at the
negotiations in Geneva and saw the 'politics' of the
Soviet celegation.)

<a ne

"9, My trips abroad opened my eyes wide to the
true reality. With my own eyes, I saw how people
live, how much they earn, how they can dress and live
on their wages, and I paid special attention to the
life of ordinary people and not to that of scientists,
engineers, etc. And all the propaganda about the
enormous armies of unemployed in the countries of the
West, about the ‘heavy exploitation', and the ‘un-
believably difficult life' flew immediately out of
my head. And that which I met with in my work, the F |
sending of Soviet citizens abroad--who gets sent where ; we
and how, etc.--this finally debunked this propaganda. i
Many of my acquaintances--GUK, CHURANOV and others-~
think back with great pleasure about life abroad.

I became a Komscholnik like all the others. It was ~ - ns 4
different in regards to the Party: I joined the Party

working in the KGB and already at that time there was
a lack of faith and indecisiveness in me. My father
continually inststed on this, saying that without the
Party I would never move ahead and would not have ©

success in life. But I myself understood and saw

- * that I would not be able to work in the KGB unless I .

else, I would truly never move ahead in my. career

unless T entere

ginning of my entry into the Party, I eeeply hated
all the Party talmudism and dogmatism, All the
Party meetings were literally a torture. Especially
when I Lecame the deputy chief of the section, the
chief of the section, and the deputy chief of the
department, because then I had to speak at these
meetiags. Because this meant to lie, to twist my
soul, and to attempt to show myself as deeply dedi-
cated to the Party and its course.

"11, In 1960 my oldest girl's asthmatic attacks
became worse. The question of a change of climate
was raised. At that time the SCD needed to send an
officer to Ethiopia for two to three years to conduct
counterintelligence work among the Soviet specialists
there. t cost me a great deal of effort to personally
talk GRIBANOV into letting me go. The Party and work
references had been confirmed, all the questionnaries
were already filled out, the photos had been submitted;
that is, all the formalities had been accomplished.
But at the very last moment the Central Personnel of
the KGB began to protest against my gong with my
family to Ethiopia. The reason for this was that from
the house check made at my place of residence they
received information that I sometimes came nome in
a drunken condition and on this ground had quarrels
with my wife. A tour abroad with my family was neces~
gary because of the health of my daughter (since 1963
the illness has become better) and also it would
have been advantageous from the financial point of
view. From this time on I understood that Personnel
Wald not let me go abroad with my family.

"12, Knowing many officers in the FCD, 2 began
to understand that being sent abroad is entirely
determined, not by knowledge, experience in work and
success, but only by the absolute ‘cleanliness' of
the person's autobiography and complete assurance as
to his limitless dedication to the Party and the

government. But not only being sent abroad but the

assignment of personnel in the First and Second Chief
Directorates and the entire KGB depends on the reasons
indicated by me and also on good relations with the
Radership and good connections with workers in Central

Personnel.

"13, I lived about 11 years with my wife and our
life was not a hell. It is true that there were
quarrels and basically they boiled down to the fact
that she took an extremely unfavorable attitude to-
wards my delays at work and also when I would be de-
layed with some of my friends and acquaintances after
work and would come home with a few drinks under my
belt. Of course, I loved and love’my. children and only
the fact that they are taken care of financially until
they grow up and have received an education to some
extent consoled me in taking the decision to leave the
USSR. What do I have in mind when I speak of financial
“security? After the death of my father, the family
received a large monetary allowance, plus the money

suggested that we not do this before her death. And;

"14, If the defections of PETROV, RASTVOROV and
DERYABIN passed without evoking any particular
thoughts, the defection to the United States of GOLI%-
SYN, whom I had heard of as an intelligent person and
a capable officer, undoubtedly caused me to think
very deeply. Because to act thus, it is necessary
to have not only boldness and decisiveness, but also
great. strength of will. And already I put to myself
the question, will I be able to act thus in view of
the dissatisfactions and disillusionments which had
accumulated inside of me?

"15, Being in Geneva in 1962, not long before
my departure I myself of my own desire entered into
contact with you. The reason for this was the loss
of money received by me for operational expenses. I
would have been unable to accumulate such a sum of
money before my departure and there was nobody to

’ borrow from (at this time GUK was’ himself in finan-
cial difficulty and at the same time ne was already
preparing for his return home). To tell the truth
about the loss of the money would have meant that it
would be necessary to explain where and in what cir-
cumstances it had been lost. This would have risked
expulsion from the KGB and a serious reprimand from
the Party. Not to tell the truth, to think up some
sort of a story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of
all, they might think that I had appropriated the
money, that is, stolen it. And this would be for me
the worst of all and I would, of course, in such
event have told the truth.

"16. To tell the truth, it was only after my
return home from Geneva in 1962 that I gradually, not
immediately, began fully to realize all the seriousness
of my contact with you and its full meaning. And
although I did not give you any promises cr assurances
about our continued contact in the future, I under-
stood that you sooner or later would set yourself the
task of continuing our contact. And here it was that’.
weighing up all the reasons and causes which I have
indicated above that in 1962 I took for myself: the

- decision to leave the USSR at the first opportunity
and that I started to work towards being sent on a trip

abroad.

"17. Of course, I wanted to come abroad with some
sort of 'baggage', that is, with materials which could
be useful and necessary. for you. In’this entire period
up to January 1964 I tried to collect information which

_ would be of the maximum value for you. My assignment
_.to- the position of deputy chief of the Seventh Depart-
‘ment in-July 1962 gave me a greater. opportunity than ~

"18, The publication in 1963 by the foreign press

about VASSALL in the spring of 1962. Fortunately, the
leadership of the FCD,as I iearned from GUK, CHURANCV,
and TARABRIN, cama to the conclusion that here the
Americans had been helped by GOLITSYN. But at the :

But the publication in the American press of Alsop's
articles on the CIA alarmed me extremely. This ar-

1. Introduction —

SER TNE e

Tne extent to which NOSENKO made himself available for

meetings with CIA in Ceneva in 1962 and 1964 is reviewed here

in connection with his stetements about the KGB duties assigned

to him for these trips, his visits to the XGB Legal Residency,

and his personal assoc1ation with other Soviets. Although

NOSENKO was not precise about how he spent his days and nights i

in Geneva, he did indicate that he was his own boss, disposed |

of his time as he saw fit, and for the most part had little to |

do. At the first meeting with CIA in 1962 he accounted for his
freedom of movement by saying: "it can come and co 4s Ipleage
at any time. (ambassador) ZORIN knows wno I am, almost the
entire delegation knows who I am, pecause I don't need to pre-
tend. Nobody pays any attention to me. They know thet I am
not a Ministry of Foreign Affai:s men (at the conference :
sessions). I sit, listen, leaf through some papers. For this :
reason I can leave the conference at any time, cr i do not come
at all, and no one will sey a word to me." CIA made no attempt
to place NOSENKO under surveillance in 1962 end 1964, and there
is no evidence from other sources confirming or disproving a
NOSENKO's statements about his activities while eway from the

CiA safehouse. .

2. Official Duties in Geneva

In 1962 NOSENKO said he was the sole KGB officer in the .
94.man Soviet Gelegation to the Disarmament Conference and 4s i
such he was responsible for the security and behavior of the
entire delegation.” To assist him in carrying out these security
officer functions, NCSENKO had the services of a number of
ccopted informants of the KGB who were serving in the delega-
tion. In addition, NOSENKO had the specific mission of check-
ing on suspicions attached to one of the delegation members,

P, F. SHAKHOV?* but ry the time he established contact with CIA,
he said, this assignment had already been completed.

In 1964, NOSENKO said his only operational task then was to
hendle the general security responsibilities for the Soviet
delegation, as he hac done in 1962. There was no specific
mission such as the ome concerning SHAKHOV in 1962.

NOSENKO nas described his investigations of SHAKHOV, but
. he has never indicated either that he conducted security checks
‘ of other delegation members in 1962 and 1964, or that he re- ,
: ceived any security-type information (except on SHAKHOV) from !
‘ the KGB cooptees who were supposed to be reporting to him. i
: Likewise, NOSENKO hes not said that he prepared communications |

3, Visits to the KG3 Legal Residency

Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to
the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for
more than a day or two, the Legal Resident, S. I. GAVRICHEV,
would invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself.

. gave a lecture ‘on naunter intelligence. ‘to the assentled members
of the Legal Residency. This lecture was given at GAVRICHEV's
request, althouch it was only after some hesitation on ‘the part | :
of. the Legal Resident that all of his subordinates were brought -
together to heaf NOSENKO. (In return for hélping the Legal
Residency to perform counter-surveillance on, several occasions,
NOSEKKO said, he was sometimes allowed by GAVRICHZV to have the
use of an operetional car and driver to. go shopping and. carry
out other private errands.) .

Similarly, in 1964, NOSENKO said he was making nearly daily
visits to the Legal Residency. During the 1964 meetings NOSENKO
stated that it was his close relationship with M.S. TSYMBAL*
which made it possible for him to have visited the Geneva Legal
Residency so frequently, both in 1962 and 1964. "According to
the strict rules," NOSENKO told CIA, "an officer in a status .
such'as mine should not even go to the Residency. In this case : i
it is only because I.am deputy chief of a department and GAV-. ° :
RICHEV knows my position perfectly well (it is not lower than ‘
his}, and because I have such a sympatnetic personal relation- i
ship with TSYMBAL." He then went on to say that TSYMBAL "sort :
of escorted me to the Residency. They could have simply said:
‘You are here on a mission, we have our own mission, and we
have nothing in common.'" But, NOSENKO indicated, this was
not.the case, thanks to TSYMBAL's intervention.

4. Association with TSYMBAL : ;

At the secord meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO volunteered '
information on TSYMBAL's KGB background and his current missions :
in Geneva, then alluded to his having spoken with TSYMBAL in
Geneva but without placing any particular emphasis on this
relationship.

In 1964, however, NOSENKO claimed that their relationship
was close, explained that it was TSYMBAL (again in Geneva at
the same time) wno gained NOSENKO's admissicn to the Legal
Residency, and said that he had twice gone to see TSYMBAL off
on train trips, once on 24 January when TSYMBAL went to Bern
and again on 28 January when TSYMBAL left Lausanne for Rome.
NOSENKO told CIA he had been dealing with TSYMBAL since 1960
or 1961. At that time "We were looking over some candidates
for recruitment and came across some whose background would
have made them suitable for the Special (Illegals) Director-
ate...Then when we came (here) in 1962 for the Disarmament

GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, cy'virtue of |
TSYMBAL's efforts in 1962 to have NOSENKO transferred and his
leaving the impression with GRIBANOV that NOSENK9 (who was still
in Geneva) nad agreed to this action.

Questioned in April 1964 about his association with TSYMBAL,
NOSENKC stated that he met TSYMBAL for the first time several
@ays before their departure for Geneva. Besides saying again
that he saw TSYMBAL almost daily at the Legal Residency and
that TSYMBAL's assistance enabled him to enter the Legal Resi- -
dency, NOSENKO reported that in 1962 he went out with TSYMBAL
several times a week to eat lunch or dinner; sometimes they were
joined by I. S. MAYGROV,* sometimes by A. 'K. KISLOV (see next
section), and sometimes the two ate alone. During the 1966
interrogations, NOSENKO said that, while he had seen TSYMBAL
on a daily kasis in 1962, he saw him only twice an 1964. once
when TSYMBAL travelled to Geneva from Bern for ore or two days
and later when NOSENKO saw TSYMBAL ‘off for. Rome from Lauranne.

5. Association with Other Soviets.

» NOSENKO said in 1962 that the other Soviets he saw most
often were A. K. KISLOV and Yu. I. GUK.** KISLOV, with NOSENKO :
was one of the four members of the Soviet delegation staying i j
at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva, and was said to be head of the ; i 1
American Section of TASS and a genuine correspondent.*** During
the 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO reported that KISLOV was .
not a KGB officer and made no reference of his having any
affiliation with the KGB. NOSENKO did say, however, that he
had arranged for KISLOV's name to be given the KGB double
agent B. Ye. BELITSKIY**** to use as a notional source of
information on Soviet disarmament policy; BELITSKIY was to -
pass this information to his CIA contacts. NOSENKO made
numerous references to drinking and carousing with KISLOV,
specifically with recard to a night in early June - when
NOSENKO was robbed of or squandered his operational funds,
which brought him to CIA - and on the night of 10 June 1962
when NOSENKC squandered 2000 Swiss francs (the money CIA had
given him) on wine and women.***** In giving NOSENKO the
money to defray these personal expenses, the CIA handlers
expressed to him their concern over the dangers to his security
arising from KISLOV's knowledge of this inexplicable source of .
income. NOSENKO replied that.there was ‘no need to be concerned’ :

order to have operational meetings with agents.

** Both KISLOV and GUK are mentioned in the discussion of
the "ANDREY" case (see Part VI.D.3.b.). GUK was also a
friend of GOLITSYN, who reported extensively on GUK's ~

““career in the KG3 including his service in the United
States. . : Bet tt

omooertn*1964" NOSENKO” Confirmed that” he “had ‘spent’ mich “time with “
KISLOV in Geneva two years before and that they had become

very friendly. For the first time, NCSENKO reported that .
KISLOV had beer, a KSB operational contact while in the United

_ States, that he had been introduced to KISLOV by a KGB officer

in Moscow prior. to his departure for Geneva in 1962 in order
to be able to exploit him during the Geneva Conference, and
that after retursing from Ggneva. KISLOV had been recruited as .
a KGB agent on the basis of a favorable report NOSENKO had ~
prepared.

Often during the 1962 meetings NOSENKO spoke of his “big,
big friend" GUK, whom he described as the Deputy Legal Resident
in Geneva and the only “strong officer" in the ZGB Legal Resi-
dency. He implied that his friendship with GUK, a former member
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, was of longstanding. NOS.
ENKO related that he and GUK were together nearly every day in
Geneva. They often went out together to chat and have a few
Grinks, and as a consequence, NOSENKO was able to elicit infor-
mation about some of GUK's operations there. In 1964 NOSENKO

‘told CIA he found it difficult to obtain information on the

activities of the Geneva Legal Residency because he no longer”
had a good friend there like GUK, who had been reassigned to
KGB Headquarters. when questioned later in 1964 about his
relationship with GUK, NOSENKO said he had come to know GUK
well only during his 1962 TDY in Geneva.

6. Availability for Meetings with CIA

In speaking to David MARK on 6 June 1962, NOSENKO expressed
displeasure over MARK's insistence on deferring their luncheon
(at which NOSENKO sought contact with American Intelligence)
until three days later. When the first meeting with CIA did
take place on 9 June 1962, NOSENKO stayed. for three hours,
and it was at his suggestion that another meeting was scheduled
for 11 June. This second meeting in 1962 lasted seven hours.
NOSENKO remained in Geneva until 15 June, and in the interim
he met CIA officers three more times for over seven hours
altogether. He offered to meet again on the day of his ce-
parture, but this proposal was rejected as needlessly endan-
gering his security.

From the first 1964 meeting on 23 January to his defection
on 4 February, NOSENKO was met a total of 13 times, the sessions
lasting for five or six hours. He was able to come to the CIA

- safehouse every day but one, and this opportunity was skipped
_, at the request of the CIA handlers. By mutual consent, most

of the meetings started in the afternoon, but on two occasions

. NOSENKO arrived as early as 0930 hours; several meetings went

on until past midnight. . NOSENKO appeared to be totally at
the disposal of CIA, to be the master of his time, and to have
ho other demands for his attention except for the visits to
the KGB Legal Residency, "looking in" on an occasional session
of the Disarmament Conference, and attendance at a reception.

“BY Timing of Defection

After telling CIA on 24 January 1964 cf his decision to
defect, NOSENKO at the same meeting concurred when CIA gave
operational and administrative reasons for hin to Stay- in?
‘place until the middle of February, During the week that: fol-
lowed, the date of the defection was moved up to 8 February
in accordance with NOSENKO's wishes and with his reports ine
dicating that less information of value would be forthcoming
than CIA had at first thought. On-4 February, however,
NOSENKO reported that he was being recalled to Moscow for a
conference cn tureign tourism in the USSR, and he therefore
placed himself in CIA custody on that date.* Details on
the tining of NOSENKO's defection are given in the following
paragraphs.

At the 24 January iaceting the CIA case officers agreed
in principle with NOSENKO's Jecisicn to defect... NOSENKO
felt that it would be best for him to disappear from Geneva
without a trace, leaving all his personal possessions be-
hind; he assuzed that CIA could exfiltrate hin from Switzer-
land to the United States. Iie wanted to carry out this
plan as soon as-possible, but the CiA officers encouraged
him--and NOSENXO agreed--to remain in place for at least
three weeks more. The reasons given NOSENKO for this re-
quest were:

- The desire to get information on the local KGB
Legal Residency and the Soviet delegation to the Dis-
armament Conference while he still had access to this
infornation;

« The value of having NOSENKO present when 0.M.
GRIBANOV made a visit to Geneva about 7 February a
visit known to CIA only through NOSENKO;**

-e The potential value to be derived from NOSENKO's
in place spotting of CIA recruitment targets among the
Soviet representation in Geneva;

- The necessity of making arrangements, accept-
able to NOSENKO, for his defection and resettlement.

~ The events which followed NOSENKO's agreement to remain
in place for a short time longer are chronicled below: |

* The report of NOSENKO's recall to Moscow for the con-
ference on tourism is discussed further in Part III.F.

®® GRIBANOV was in 1964 the Chief of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate and, according to NOSENKO and other sources,
the sponsor cf NOSENKO's rapid rise in State Security.
Several G22@gygWaEUs sources, have reported that GRIBANOV
was fired from the KGB as a result of NOSENKO's de- :

30 January 1964: At the seventh meeting of the series, . i
NOSENKO Said that there now appeared to be littie likeiihood
that GRIBANOV would visit Geneva or Paris.* Therefore, he . i
wanted to defect right away, As reasons he cited the i
emotional strain of any further delay and the fact. that he :
and his Case officers were wasting their time working ;
against the local KGB Legal Residency, which had no worth-
while or promising targets. He also felt that nothing of ;
value could be obtained from the Soviet delegation because 1 j
"TSARAPKIN himself doesn't know what he will say until he : 3
is told by Moscow the day before," The CIA handlers, however, : i
delayed the defection for one week by cbtaining NOSENKO's i :
agreement to assist in an audio operation: CIA propcsed to
install listening devices in the offices of the KGB Legal
Residency, and NOSENKO said he would check certain physical
aspects ot the delegation buildings. As the best time for
the defection, he suggested Saturday mcerning, 8-February,
because he probably would not be missed until the following
Monday, This date was tentatively scheduled, and NOSENKO
again repeated his desire simply to "disappear without a
trace." He also asked about exfiltration plans.

reconnaiSsance of the KGB Legal Residency in connection with
the proposed audio operation, which would invoive microphone

had accidentally overheard in the Residency that the building
-used its cwn batteries and generator, and therefore the
scheme would not work. He repeated his willingness to remain.
in place until the arrival of the CHEREPANOV Papers™, which
-he was told were enroute from Washington, He explained that
he had felt pressure at the previous meeting because of an
imminent move by the delegation from its. hotel to the. Soviet
villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappearance would
ij... . be noticed more quickly. This move, he had now learned, had Sg

would be considerable confusion among the Soviets in Geneva

for a time following his disappearance, .and that there would

be no real concern until the evening.. To foster Soviet un-

Soviet Official Reactions —
he Chief of the Soviet .. Delegation: to the Dis-
armament Conference notified the Soviet Ambassador in Bern —
shortly before noon on 6 February 1964 that NOSE‘KO had dis-
appeared, correctly placing the date as 4 February; they
speculated that. he: might have been “poisoned” or: injured in

a car accident.*. Two more days passed without Soviet authorities.
making any additional public or private statements on the subject.
Later events showing Soviet official reactions to NOSENKO's de-
fection are presented below in chronological order:

6 February: A Soviet spokesman in’ Geneva reported to
Swiss police that NOSENKO, an “expert" temporarily assigned to
Geneva, had been missing for four days. oO

9 February: Evening news brosdcasts in Geneva carried
reports attributed to poth Soviet and Swiss sources that NOSENKO

had disappeared. 2

10° February: Unidentified. Soviet sources were quoted in
the press as having said it was presumed that he hed defected.

AU. S. Department of State press release was issued iden-
‘tifying NOSZNKO as a KGB officer and ‘acknowledging his request
for political asylum in the United States. a

1] February: The Department of State was advised informally

by Ambassador DOBRYNIN in Washington that a Soviet note to be
delivered later would ask how NOSENKO had left Switzerland,
request his release, and demand an immediate interview with him.

1? February: 5S. K. TSARAPKIN, the head of the Soviet Dele-
gation to the Disarmament Conference, read a statement at a press
conference in which he strongly condemned the Swiss authorities
for permitting NOSENKO's "kidnapping" and for hindering efforts
to locate him. TSARAPKIN demanded that immediate steps be taken
to return NOSENKO to Soviet custody. :

At simultaneous press conferences in Bern and Geneva, the
Swiss rejected these accusations of non-cooperation and noted
the Soviet delay in advising the police of NOSENKO's disappear-
‘ance and Soviet failure to cooperete with Swiss authorities in
locating NOSENKO.

The Soviet note predicted by DOBRYNIN was delivered to

;the State Department, and a noncommittal reply was given to

ee .

* Apparently no effort was made to notify Moscow immediately.
Special intelligence shows that no cable traffic was passed
from Geneva to Moscow from 1630 hours on 3 February until
1900 hours on 7 February: at 1915 hours on the 7th, the
Geneva Residency transmitted a short top priority cable to
Moscow. -Likewise, after one routine cable on 4 February, .
the Bern Residency sent no traffic to Moscow on 5 February.
Seven cables, at least four of which were of routine pre-

- eedence, were sent to Moscow.on 6 February; thereafter there
was no traffic from Bern to Moscow until the early morning
of 10 February. . :

. Soviet queries concerning the requested interview and the "
means of NOSENKO’s departure from: Switzerland.

The Swiss Embassy asked for a meeting with NOSENKO in
order to obtain assurance that the defection had been volun-
tary. Arrangements were made to have NCSENKO meet with Swiss.
and Soviet representatives in Washington as soon as possible, :

(NOSENKO arrived in Washington at 2130 hours ‘this same
evening.)

13 February: NOSENKO said he had no objection to talking
to the Swiss, but he would see the Soviets only if necessary.

14 February: In Moscow, Anbassador KOHLER was summoned
to the office of Soviet Foreign Minister GROMYKO, who read
him a statement deploring the "evasive" reply of the State

- Department to Soviet inquiries in Washington and terming the.
whole event of NOSENKO's ‘disappearance a "gross provocation
by American Intelligance organs." GROMYKO repeated the demand
for NOSENKO's immediate release from American custody.

The Counselor of the Swiss Embassy, Jean-Louis NATURAL, .
interviewed NOSENKO at the Washington offices of the U.S. : t i
Immigration and Naturalization Service late in the afternoon. : }
The Soviet confrontation-immediately afterwards was handled |
by Minister Counselor G. M. KORNIENKO, second to Ambassador
DOBRYNIN at the Soviet Embassy, and Third Secretary V. F. . :
ISAKOV, a recent arrival in Washington, (ISAKOV had been a i
y member of the Soviet Delegation to the 1962 Disarmament :
; Conference in Geneva, where NOSENKO said he had first met. him.)
NOSENKO told both the Swiss and the Soviets that he had defected
of his own free will after careful consideration and that he
had no desire to return to the Soviet Union. In response to
KORNIENKO's questions, he specifically renounced his status and
rights as a Soviet citizen,

H. Reactions of NOSENKO's Family

Two women who said they were the mother and wife of NOSENKO t
called at the American Embassy in Moscow on five occasions i
between 24 February and 23 March 1964,* and NOSENKO, who on :
the basis of physical descriptions confirmed their identities, im aa
said he hud no doubt that the KGB had directed them to do this ~ |
in order to pressure him to return. the women expressed dis- . Pook.
belief that NOSENKO had voluntarily betrayed his family and his [ -
country. They sought a personal meeting with him in the United
States or enywhere else, submitted letters for him, and returned :
to the Lmbassy to ask whether he had replied; the younger Mrs.
NOSENKO explained that she required some definite statement in
writing from her husband so that she could plan her own future
and that of the NOSENKO children.

NOSENKC proposed to respond to his family's letters by
writing two of his own, one wnich would be intended for KGB
consumption and the other for his wife alone. The first of
these would state NOSENKO's irrevocable decision to remain in
the United States and to sever all ties with his family and
homeland. The second letter would be read by Mrs. NOSENKO in
the Embassy, left there, and not reported to the KGB; in it he
would express hope for a reunion, ask her to wait for hin, and
tell her to indicate her willingness to join him in the West
by writing either "yes" or "no" on the letter itself. Although :
NOSNEKO prepared both letters, only the first was sent to his
wife; it was mailed from Washington to the NOSENKO home in
Moscow on 7 April 1964.

2 meee Stebbins

From March 1964 nothing was heard from NOSENKO's relatives
until mid-1966, when Yuriy Dmitriyevich KOROLEV,** a Soviet
journalist, visited Paris and spoke with representatives of the
French magazine Paris Match. KOROLEV indicatec that he would

¥~Only once before had members of a defector's family called
at a foreign embassy in Moscow. Following the defection of
Yuriy Vasilyevich KROTKOV in England in September 1963, his
wife appeared at the British Embassy to make inquiries about
him. KROTKOV, an admitted agent of the KGB Second Chief —
Directorate, is believed by MI-5 and CIA to remain under
KGB control.

** CIA records show that KOROLEV was employed at the Soviet
Pavilion of the Brussels World's Fair in 1958 as a photo-
correspondent for the Soviet publication Sputnik. He visited
Japan in 1963 and the United States in February-March 1965,
at the invitation of Life magazine, as a,photographer for
Novosti, a Soviet news agency. On the latter trip he was to

_ be accompanied; by Feliks Avramovich ROSENTAL, an interpreter
but no record of ROSENTAL's arrival is available. KOROLEV
is believed to be identical.with Yuriy KOROLEV who, as of
1964, was employed part-time for the United Press Inter-
national correspondent in Moscow, Henry SHAPIRO. Both
NOSENKO and GOLITSYN have identified SHAPIRO as an agent
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate (see Part V.C.).

and English, the magazine staff did not seriously pursue the
matter at that time. : :

On 10 October 1966, however, KOROLEV again appeared at the
Paris Match offices, this time with one Feliks ROSENTAL who acted
as his interpreter. He displayed a photo spread showing NOSENKO's
wife and family going about their daily affairs in Moscow, and
he submitted a-one-page document in English which gave a short.
account of NOSENKO's background. The document said in part:
“NOSENKO's family consists of a wife, 35, two daughters, 10 and
12, a mother and a younger brother. The family is not prose-
cuted (sic) but feel very badly about the incident {the defec-
tion).- Very soon the wife will apply to the International
Lawyers Organization for a divorce and compensation. It is
possible that this case will be given much publicity. His wife
has not heard from him since he defected, but it is obvious

represented as coming from a Soviet Government source, also said
that additional photographs of .NOSENKO's family in Moscow could

knowing NOSENKO could be arranged for a Paris Match correspon-
dent.* .

* According to information available to CIA, a divorce from

a defector from the Soviet Union, who is legally considered
to be an enemy of the state, is granted automatically upon
the wife's request. There is. no known precedent for either
Soviet-inspired publicity or divorce difficulties in any
previous Soviet defection,

was therefore ultimately responsible. LMreported further
fa ht that GkIBANCV had been Ccistissed from the KGB
and the Commanigt Party immediately after the defection, ad-
ding that GRIBANOV had personally authorized NOSENKO's 1964
trip to Geneva, despite the fact that he had received a sum-
Mary statement of NOSENKO's capabilities and activities which
contained enough"compromising material" to ent suc ’

a military plant outside Moscow and is considered a “nothing."***
Others dismissed from the KGB included GUK and Ye.A, TARABRIN,
Chief of the British Department, First Chief Directorate.****

ae According to NOSENKO in 1965, it was BANNIKOV who sup-
ported his candidacy for the 1964 trip to Geneva; as
far as he knew, NOSENKO said, GRIBANOV was not involved.
Earlier, however, NOSENKO stated that his 1964 trip had
been approved by GRIBANOV.

*#*t Reportedly GRIBANOV continued an operational contact with
a Western Ambassador in Moscow until as recently as the
autumn of 1964, This is a type of activity in which
GRIBANOV was often engaged while serving as Chief of the
Second Chief Directorate.

“ ak#* Jn 1962 NOSENKO told CIA: "“GRIBANOV and I are very friendly

socially and we have often caroused together unofficially...
He is very friendly and we often go out drinking together."
. Under interrogation in Aprii 1964 NOSENKO was asked speci-
__.fically whether he had ever gone out socially with GRIBANOV
after working hours. He replied that he had done s0 on one
occasion and that TARABRIN was present at the time. In
February 1965 NOSENKO was asked the same question and this
time answered that he had seen GRIBANOV three times socially,
- most recently in October or: November-1963; TARABRIN, he said,
was the only other person present on these three occasions; ..
all three outings began as drinking, parties .in Moscow res- . ;
taurants and the latter two ended at the homes cf girls
NOSENKO had been asked to procure. Although ‘indicated
that TARABRIN was Chief of the British Department at the
time he was fired, NOSENKO said he had held this position
only until 1963, when he became Deputy Chief of the newly
established Service No. 2 (Counterintelligence) of the
- First Chief Directorate. oo. oo. a

A. Introduction "
‘The biography of NOSENKO is built largely upon his ownwatate-°.  -
ments to CIA, but certain portions of it have been substantiated bo
(as well as contradicted) by other Soviet sources. Given first
below is the NOSENKO autobiography for the pericd preceeding his
entry into the #98, then follows a summary of his statements
about his non-professional life since becoming a KGB officer, and

‘(finally there is presented a review of what other sources have

said on these subjects.. A separate section of this paper, Part V,
discusses NOSENKO's career in the KGB. .

BB. NOSENKO'S Pre~KGB Autobiography

Although several other sources have since NOSENKO's defec-~
tion furnished fragmentary information concerning NOSENKO's early . }
personal history, NOSENKO himself has,-of course, been the prin- : 4
cipal source on this topic. He volunteered information during F
the 1962 meetings, during debriefings in early 1964, and under
‘ interrogation in April 1964, in 1965, and in 1956.° These vari-
ous accounts are arranged in separate columns in the following
table, and they are organized chronologically from NOSENKO'Ss
birth to his alleged entry into the KG3. The first column in
the table cpntains statements which NOSENKO made during the June
1962 meetings in Geneva; these were taken from the transcripts
of the meetings and, for the most part, are in NCSENKO's own :
words, The column headed "1964," derived from the April 1964 . i
interrogation, reflects a number of changes in his story before : 3
a . and during that interrogation. Most of the information given :
: “in the "1965" column was taken from discussions with NOSENKO,
. mainly on his early years, by a CIA psychologist in May of that
year; however, material from the February 1965 interrogation :
and from DERYABIN's interrogation in duly and August has also
been included when it was not covered in the psychologist's ques- Hl
tioning and when NOSENKO signed protocols certifying his state- :
ments to be correct. The "April 1966" column is comprised of
remarks by NOSENKO in a signed autobicgraphy submitted to CIA
at that time. The final column presents the results of the.
October 1966 interrogation as they pertain to NOSENKO's early
life. From column to column appear inconsistencies and contra-
dictions with regard to dates and locations furnished by NOSENKO,
although in 1964, again in 1965, and most recently in October
1966 NOSENKO has said that he was "now" telling the truth. The
table shows where he has admitted having previously lied about
certain events and where he seems to have forgotten his earlier
statements to CIA about the occurrence of cther events affecting
his life.

Geneva in 1964 confirms his claim that he married Lyudmila
KOZHEVNIKOVA on 27 June 1953." (They married approximately | :
six months after he says he first met her at a Sanatorium or.” - :
“rest home” outside Moscow and about three months after ‘he i
says he joined the kG3.) Immediately after their marriage
the couple moved into the home of NOSENKO's new in-laws at
Ulitsa Serafimovich 2, Moscow, where they lived until obtain-
ing their own apartment on Narodnaya Ulitsa in January 1955.*
KOZHEVNIKOVA's father is Yulian Nikolayevich KOZHEVNIKOV, a
metallurgical engineer by training, who held the position of
First Deputy Chairman of the State Scientific Research Com-
mittee (GKKNIR) of the RSFSR at the time of NOSENKO's defec-

tion. **

NOSENKO said that he has two daughters by this second
marriage. According to his: passport, the eldest of these,
Oksana, was born on 21 August 1954’ and the other, Tamara, on
13 July 1958.*** NOSENKO in 1962 displaved to his CIA handlers
a photojraph of the two girls and their mother and made a par-
ticular point of noting the close physical resemblance between

a
* On 23 April 1964 NOSENKO was questione? on the various
apartments he occupied in Moscow. He seid that, from the
time of his marr:age to TELEGINA until his departure for
his first GRU post in the Far Fast, he lived in an apart-
ment on Meshchanskaya Ulitsa. He gave up this apartment,
he said, in 1950, when his Navy orders came through.
Having made this statement, NCSENKO was then asked why
the 1951 Moscow telephone directory still listed him at
; the Meshchanskaya Ulitsa address. He replied that he could
. . not explain but that he was considered to have vacated the
house in 1950. (He later said he moved to the Far East in
1951 - see Section IV.B.) NOSENKO then said that the
previous tenant at Narodnaya Ulitsa 13 had been one Nikita
ISHCHENKO. Although the phone then in the apartment was
switched to NOSENKO's name for billing purposes, NOSENKO
j never bothered to have the change entered in the Moscow
: phone book; he said that this would have required a visit
i .: * to a downtown office, the filling out of numerous forms,
: : etc.; besides he added, he did not use the telephone any~
Hq : way. Therefore, NOSENKO said, from 1955 until his defec-
7 7 tion in 1964, the telephone in his apartment was listed
under the name of ISHCHENKO. He has repeated this story
during subsequent questionings. The 1961 Moscow phone
directory carries no listing for NOSENKO; it does list
+. JSHCHENKO but gives his address as Krasnokholmskaya
--  Naberezhnaya, not Narodnaya Ulitsa. . ;

-then studying in the first class at school; in 1965, how-
ever, he said she began school in the. fall of 1962.

Oksana and himself. He said that he and his wife refer to her
as his “double" (kopiya). His wife, in a letter after the

NOSENKO's father, the Shipbuilding Minister, died of
stomach cancer in August 1956, three years after NOSENKO says
he entered the KGB Second Chief Directorate. The period of
time surrounding his father's death was, according to NOSENKO,

"a turning point in his personal and professional life. -It was

then that he “found himself" after an irresponsible ‘past,
@rinking and wenching, and indifference to his work.

2. venereal Diskasle

The incident which NOSENKO has most often citeé as an
example of his irresponsibility in the period prior to 1956
involved his illegal use. of KGB alias documents to cover treat-
ment for a case of goncrrhea he contracted in 1954, at the time
his wife was pregnant with their first child. . The CIA psycho-
logist who questione@ NOSENKO in May 1966 submitted the follow-
ing summary of NOSENKG's statements about’ this incidéent, which
are about as given earlier (during the April 1964 interroga-
tion):

"A girl friend he had known in Leninerad since 1945 cane
to visit relatives in Moscow in 1954, She called him, and he
spent some time with her. She was not a prostitute, and he
had slept with her before, so he thought nothing of it. Later
he developed what he feared was a venereal disease. Since his
wife was pregnant, he was safe both from discovery and the
danger of infecting her. He searched frantically around Moscow
for a private doctor who treated such diseases, but could not

find one. Some of his friends at the office suggested a central.

clinic that would require no documents. He went here but when
confronted with a request for documents, had the choice of
showing his KGB certificate or using a false passport he had
for business. He tried to talk the doctor into letting him

go home to get his documents, but the doctor said he would have
to be accompanied by a member of the militia; otherwise he
might not come back. He was required to take treatment of a
conmmunicable disease. He was forced to give the false document.
He..came back for treatment about three times and was ordered
to report back in two weeks for a final check. They also
demanded the name of the girl, but he claimed he had only just
met -her and did not know who she was. He forgot to go back
and a nurse visited the safehouse about two times and left
a-note for him to report. However, he did not go to the safe-
house so knew nothing of the note. In the false passport was
a listing of where the named person worked, a fictitious
factory. As the result of the clinic inquiries, the request

“ for information got into the hands of the section which made

the documents. NOSENKO was called before the deputy chief of
the Directorate and severely criticized. He explained what
had happened and was given five days of house arrest. However,
the chief of his section had also gotten word of the infraction
and sentenced him to fifteen days of house arrest without even
talking to him. He told his wife he was going on a trip and
moved into the administrative room near the office to serve

Committee called NOSENKO's father on the phone and told him
the whole story. NOSENKO's father never told éither NOSENKO's
wife or mother of the incident, but did chide NOSENKO about
it. The incident was brought before the Komsomol and discussed.
A written reprimand for. immoral conduct-unauthorized use of
official documents was placed in his record. This was also

a final warning meaning that any other infraction would result
in expulsion. .He made the statement that he had been punished
for this incident many timés. He could not immediately apply
for party membership; the incident was broucht up repeatedly
in Komsomol.meetings and even in party meetings (after he was
accepted) as a horrible example; and it kept him from being
promoted from Senior: Lieutenant to Captain. (The Deputy-
Director who gave him five days was a member of the promotion
commission.)"

Although there have been slight changes and contradictions
in NOSENKO's numerous accounts of this story (the house arrest
was variously reported as 5, 10, and 15 aays) it remained
basically consistent until the October 1966 interrogations
when he said for the first time that he contracted conorrhea
from the girl in Leningrad in 1945 rather thar 1954. In 1954,

he said, he again was infected, this time by a prostitute whom

he picked up in the vicinity of the Leningrad Railroad Station
in Moscow. When the KGB required that he reveal the source,

_NOSENKO said, he ascribed the latter case to the original girl

‘from Leningrad. During the October 1966 interrogations NOSENKO
also told CIA for the first time that he had had venereal
disease on two other occasions while studying at the Institute
of Internatfonal AfFairs- —  - :

He later began to “feel more a part of the KGB," and as
a junior KGB case officer, he personally recruited Richard
BURGI in the first successful recruitment operation ‘carried :
out by the newly-created Tourist Departmert of the Second Chief
Directorate.* “And in 1956," NOSENKO said in 1964, “before
my father's death, I was made a candidate for membership in
the Communist Party and, exactly 15 days later, was assigned

the rank of Senior Case Officer. I develo a pride in my-
self. (a feeling) that Ican do things. You know how it “is.
When a person feels that he can, that he has some support,

then he works much better. ‘te has more initiative and so
forth."

3, Affiliation with Communist Party Organs

NOSENKO said that his formal participation in Communist
Party activities began in late 1943 or early 1944 when he-
joined the Komsomol at the Naval Preparatory School in Baku.
This step was a casual one, and he has said that he took it
without much thought, mainly because all his friends were

“4

* See Part V.D.4.b. for a description of the BURGI recruit-

_ mént operation. Until 1966 NOSENKO claimed to CIA that
he had received an award for his participation in this
operation. In the October 1966 interrogations he retracted
this and said that he never received any KGB award for the

'” BURGI or any other operation.

joining. When NOSENKO entered the KGB in the spring of 1953,
he transferred routinely to the Komsomol organization there
and became Secretary of the Komsomol Organization of the
Second Chief Directorate. This was a small organization
consisting, NOSENKO thought, of about 17 KGB employees; he
remained its secretary until June or July 1954, when he got
into the trouble over illegal use of operational documents.
According to NOSENKO, "Immediately after this incident the
Bureau of the Komsomol was gathered, and I was immediately
removed from the position of Secretary." A week later, a
"strict reprimand" was entered in NOSENKO's Komsomol records.

In October 1954, on the eve of his 27th birthday, NOSENKO
was forced out of the Komsomol for over-age.* At that time, x
the “strict reprimand" he had received several months earlier .
was remitted on NOSENKO's petition, and he was permitted to
leave the organization with a clean record. He was not per-~
mitted to join the Communist Party immediately, however.
NCOSENKO described the situation on 15 April 1964 as follows:
“Now I had to prove myself. Not being a candidate for Party .
membership, I asked them for assignments to show my eagerness, : :
to prove myself. I also asked the Party Organization of the
Second Chief Directorate for some ‘public service’ (obshchest-
venniy) assignments. I collected newspapers." For a year, .
NOSENKO "made qood" by running errands and performing other |

such tasks, until it was decided that he was suitable for

Party membership. He applied in January 1956 and was accepted

as a candidate member of the Party in June the same year?

full membership was granted in 1957. For over a year, from b
October 1954 until January 1956, NOSENKO said, he had the |
@istinction of being the only employee of the KGS who was | ‘

neither a Komsomol nor a Party member or applicant.

4. Statements to Others by NOSENKO

Before giving CIA the foregoing details, NOSENKO had
talked about himself to several non-Soviets, including persons
involved in cases which are reviewed in other portions of this
: per. NOSENKO informed the recruitment target Horst BRAUNS
; _ that he had two daughters.** He advised Ivan Ivanovich PREIS-
FREUND, a Finnish citizen used in the recruitment approach to
a U.S. Army sergeant in Moscow, that he was married, his
father was dead but his mother was living, he had served in
the Navy, and he had two children. PREISFREUND met the
"little girls" and later reported to CIA that, although
: NOSENKO was a “woman-chaser," he loved his daughters very
i much.*** With one KGB agent in particular, Arsene FRIPPEL,
: : NOSENKO was especially forthcoming: he told FRIPPEL of his

in 1954, the maximum age for a Komsomol member at that-time
was 25. On this basis, NOSENKO should have been excluded
in October 1953, upon reaching his 26th birthday. When
this was explained to NOSENKO by DERYABIN in July 1965,
- NOSENKO replied that he was certain he left the Komsomol”
in 1954 upon reaching the age of 27, that he was sure the
maximum age was 26 at that time, and that no special

service in the Soviet Navy; he dwelt at length on his father's
work in the Soviet shipbuilding industry; and while using the
alias "NIKOLAYEV" with FRIPPEL, he mentioned that his father
had been employed in the town of Nikolayev. On one occasion : :
NOSENKO and his wife dined at FRIPPEL's home.* NOSENKO told : . a . |
his recruitment target George DREW in April 1959 that he had

p- Soviets' Statements About NOSENKO

Portions of the NOSENKO autobiography have been supported . on
and other portions contradicted by the statements of several .
Soviets following ths defection. The Soviets' remarks dealing
with NOSENKO's KGB career are reviewed in Part V.I., but with
reference to other aspects of. the background of NOSENKO:

- Letters to NOSENKO in Geneva from his wife (who
later went to the U.S. @mbassy after his defection) in-
clude a reference to one of the daughters as his "double"
und two other personal letters in his, possession at the
time of his defection, Yu. I. GUK and’G, I. DUCHKOV, ,
referred to visits to NOSENKO's wife afd children. i

- A KGB officer in Vienna, Vladimir TULAYEV, told 5
_a CIA double agent that NOSENKO, whom he knew well, came :
” from a wonderful family, loved his wife and children,
and earned a good salary. . TULAYEV later told the agent
that he had “friends who knew NOSENKO well."**

; - A Soviet diplomat in Buenos Aires, Feliks KOVALEV, i
gaid to a CIA agent that NOSENKO had twice married, had : 4
a good family background, was the son of a Minister in 4

nature, and was "famous for his character.”
