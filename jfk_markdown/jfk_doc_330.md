their association with the Agency. I explained the Agency's serious
reservations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and
operations that are still in being. I explained that the Agency con-
tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom
Messrs, Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency
association. Mr..Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem, Thus,

in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the

Agency is currently not in a position to give Messrs. Barker and
Martinez blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they
had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily
acknowledged those conditions. . .
4. I mentioned to Mr. Schultz that if, as a result of the
discussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes
that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a
narrow request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee
that we would approve such a request, only that we would consider

_ at in view of (1) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offer as to his

nends, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to current
operations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-
donce of current and po‘sntial Agency relationships. .

by his PW case officer of his proposed transfer at a meeting on

February. A subsequent. meeting was scheduled for'8 February with
AMCLATTER/Liand the PW case officer at which time the latter intro-
duced him to the CI case officer. Subject appeared to be pleased
with thie turn of events expressing the wish that he could be put

_ « AMCLATTER/1 Progress Report: October-December 1965

1. During the reporting period AMCLATTER/1 has continued
to serve _as contact point for matters pertaining to Cuban exile
activities and related affairs of possible CI interest. He has
maintained his large number of contacts within the Cuban exile
community, contacts representing suci varied sectors as exile
political leaders, officials of exile organizations, former mem-
bers of the police force, as well as suspected underworld char-
acters. AMCLATTER/1's close rélationship to Identity A has ~~
restilted in a number of reports which were of interest to other ;
Station components and some of which were disseminated. - AMCLATTER/#
is at his best when asked to furnish information about individuals
in the WAVE area who may be of operational interest to the Station;
he pursues such assignments with the zeal of a trained bloodhound,
combing his many and various contacts for information and ‘rarely
coming up with a negative report. AMCLATTER/1 works diligently
and likes to be kept busy. It is preferable to give AMCLATTER/1
highly specific and detailed instructions, which he will then
follow to the letter. When left to his own devices he will at
times not use the best operatiors! judgment, which is usually
the result of over-zealousness and expediency rather than lack
of operational know-how or experience,

2. In November 1966, with the increase in the refugee
fiow, the CI Branch. began using the services of AMCLATTER/1
in interviewing refugees of interest to this Branch and. pra
paring debriefing reports. In this respect he ia performing
the samo kind of work ae members of the AMSERVE Team, However,
because of his continuing reporting on Cuban exile matter, his
many contacts within this community, and the fact that he ia
‘hnowa to be in touch with KUUARK among a large number of thiz

community, &t was decided not to incorporate AMCLATTER/1 into
the AMSERVE Unit but rather continue running him as a singleton
agent. lt was also felt that he resportls more favorably under
the direction and guidance of one case officer rather than as

a taam member. AMCLATTER/1 has performed very well in his new
duties aa refugee debriefer, and his debriefing reports are
models of thoroughness, if not of organization. .

3.. During the reporting period October-December, AMCLATTER/1
conducted a total of 16 refugee debriefings and: prepared reports
on these. Some of the debriefings required as many.as four
separate sessions. In addition, AMCLATTER/1 submitted ten
operational reports dealing with information concerning the
Cuban exile community, the majority of these stemming from
contacta with Identity A. Two of these were disseminated.

4. During the period October-December 1965 the following
funds were expended for AMCLATTER/1: Salary - $1,344.87; reim-
pursement for POV mileage and operational expenses - $209.44;
total = $1,554.31. .
