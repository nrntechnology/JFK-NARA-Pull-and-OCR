ce At the time of Subject's birth, Subject's father was
employed in the Brooklyn shipyards. However, he chenged jobs
frequently and was subsequently emplored on a farm near Kew
Brunswick, then in a shoe factory as a cutter, then as a butcher,
and finally became active in a Jewish cocperative organization.
As Subject's father became convinced that the future of the Jevs
vas in Russia under Soviet Commmism, in 1931 Subject's family
left the USA for the USSR for Birobidzhan vhere Subject's father
worked as en agronemist (be had sometime. prior thereto eraduated
from the National Farm School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania).

&

.

a. According to Subject, his family returned to the USA
in 1933; the motivating reascn therefor was the 111 health--

setially only seve of Subject's brotues, Sugenes

Subject alleges that, because they had retained their US citizen.
ship, they experienced no probleus either in leaving the USSR or -
in obtaining permission to return to the USA. Moreover, Subject's
father allegedly did not like life in the USSR; hovever, Sudject!s
mother and sister insisted that they return to the USSR after
only a brief stay in the USA. . .

e. As a result, later in 1933 the entire AMON family once
again returned to the USSR. Again, Subjec. states that they bad no
probiems in obtaining autnorization from the Soviet governnent
for tais trip to the USSR. yon their xeturn to the USSR, they
esteblished trerselves in Moscow where one Noah LOMDGN, a friend
of the family and a construction engineer, took Subject's father
“into his employ". Subject's father vorked in this capacity, in
the construction industry, from 1933 to 1936. Scuetine atter the
1936 purges bezgen, Subject's father worked for Komsarolsk, a Moscew
"panel board construction” outfit. In 1936 Subject's father also
worked for the Paris Commme as a shoeraker. Subject's mother

. Worked during this entire period as chief of a dining establisiment

in the school of foreign languages in Moscow. a

f. Subject began his elementary education at the DeWitt Clisten
School in the USA where he studied until 1931; he then studied in
the Soviet secondary school in Khabarovsk, Birobidzhan, until 1933.
In 1933 he again returned for one semester to the Devitt Clinton
School. Later in 1933 and 1934 he attended the Anglo-American School
in Moscow where be completed his 8th grade of school. He then :
continued his stuiies from 1533 to 1936 in Public School £327 in the Qkth
Bauman Rayon. In 1936 he entered the Moscow Avtodorozhniy Institut
vhere he studied on the civil engineering faculty, to be a highway
engines. He graduated in 1941 at which time he was sent to assist

station of Janow.

g In 1957 Subject's mother was dismissed froa her positioa
and both she en Subjec>'s fatzer degen to feel the pressure of the

purges. Subject's father, ailegedly by appealing to the then President

KALISIN, succeeced in again ecquiring exit visas for them to the
USS. Subject, vio admits that he had become a “good Commmist” ty
then had gotton “thoroughly steeped” in the Cacmmist philosophy,
elected to remain behind in the USSR. An ixportent consideratica,
he states, vas bis desire to complete his education which he vas
certain he would not be able to do in the USA for eccnomic reasons.

bh. According to Subject, his father never lost his American
citizenship. Susject's mother, hovever, in 1936 eppiied for aad
obtained Soviet citizensaipe necoruizg BW Subgsst, ks seteelir
red Soviet citizenship “by default” although he never applied
his in person; he alleges that although he was 16 years of age
tne tine, he was “granted” Soviet citizenship by virtue of bis

ar's application for ber own citizensh!v.

i. Subject remained in Moscow prices to World War . In April

1940 he married .

Ginw eee,

Secause, as a mexber of the MiG, this was considered as equivalent

to military service. Nonetheless, in response to my’ query, Subject :
admitted that this vas umususl as his activities were .? a kind vhich
were performed by old woren particularly cince during this period,
from October 1941 to September 1942, all able-bodied Soriet males
were drafted into the Soviet emy. During this period Subject lived
in conparstive ease, being assigned to Suzdal and Klin, and other
towns, According to Sudject, te wore an M.D wiform but vore no
insignia. He adzitted that “fevored treateent” was bestowed upon

him and his fenily when the MD assisted him in evacuating his first
wife and son from Moscow in August 1941 to beyond the Urals. (His
son by his first wite reportedly died on 11 Cctober 1943 of diabetes.)

ke In Septerber 1942, Subject received an appcintment to the
Moscow and Militery Irfentry Icstitute from which he graduated in Jume
WOH? ont pen whitch be woe gives the gveie cl. Ge LS Le che Sovies
Infentry. In response to ny cery, Subject again admitted that this
appointzent was highly unusual as his background did not lend itsel?
to this, as appointrents were rade out of the various military
branches, and as this implied that, as a foreiger (American), he vas
fully end corpletel; trusted ty the Soviet punitive organs who had
cleared him both for this training and the institute end for promotion
to officer status in the Soviet Army. t

- 1, Initially he vas sent to Alatev on the Volga, then to Orel
where tx was assigned to the front lines in August 19:3. He was given a
Platoon of. infantry troops in the 415th Infantry Divisice of the
Sovzet Central Front. Sovever, in October 1943 he was wounded; he was

-bit in the left forehead by e German bullet. Fe was operated on in

a field hospital ana then transferred to a Moscow hospital after he
hed recovered sufficiently. He was reclassified after his recovery
and fond suitable to continue in military service vita the limitation
thet ke should not serve on the front lines (goden ytoroi stepent ).

mB. Because the wound feted to heal completely (he bas a very
obvious scar, with approximately a 1" depression, on his forehead),
he "asked" to be assigned to a warmer clirate. The Soviet authorities,
he states, cocplied and in January 1944 dispatched him to Thilisi
where he was placed in a specia: officer's camp; he wes hospitalized
again, bed osteomyelitis complications, and ultimately diecharged fron
the Soviet military forces. Eovever, Subject provided several
contradictory stories as to the date of discharge which at various

| tines be indicated cecurred in May 1944, then in July 19¢h, and even

4m Augest louk. (NOTE: This aspect of Subject's story cothered hie;
as it was obvious to the undersimed that Subject had somewhere become

n. Upon his discharge, he vas returned to the Moscow area vhere
he was placed in a rest hax« (although Subject admitted thet there
really existed no need for this a: he ta¢ recovercd already prior
to his discharge), In continuing his narration, Subject initcated
that the rest of his story "sowids very strange ani wbelievable"
but then averred thet <t was true. He states that, strange as it
appears and despite the shortage of Soviet nen at the time (1944)
be could not "find" himself a fob. Ee went to the MVD which did
offer kin a job in Veliki Liki on the higkvays with the ScpuzDo:

royekt ; however, he was not given the job by the officiais
respousible for this. As e result, he appealed directly to the
Minister of the MWD who “tried to intercede™ in Subiect's tehalf.
Allegedly after he was given a full physical examination, he vas told
that he could not te essigned to the highwey units for reasons
which sere not spel sd out vo Sudject.

0. Subject then "sought out" work with the Nauchniy Sovet with
no luck, Ee ultimately obtained a Job with the Moscow Sovet in the
Moscow Soviet Senicr Library (sic). in November 19:4, at a “salary
of $00 rubles, Subject began working in the field of "information
on municipal works—-highway construction, architecture, sazitation,
etc. Fis immediate supervisor vas (fnu) LIZ==0BV, the bead of
information departzent of the Pypire-2 Snercy ‘Rroject. Subject sinitted,
in reply to the undersigmed‘s Guery, that nis work vas “unusual”

for several reasons. First, he was paid a salary which was unusually. .

high end out of lire with his qualifications. Secondly, though

paid a salary for a full-time job and position, he actuzily worked @
& part-time basis and was eble to come and so almost as he vished.
His work also included working on abstracts and translatiozs from
English to Russian, primarily in the field of dams, dam construction,
and hydraulics. .

Pp. In June 1949 subject states that be vas dismissed from the
foregoing position after he was given the explanation that the flow of
literature from the USA, which Subject was translating, hs¢ decreased.
In actual fact, Subject states, he was being “purged” because he vas
adJev. Fe then found a job as a laboratory assistant in a concrete
plant where he vorked fron July 19:9 to 23 February 1950. Secause
be did not like that job, Subject states he wrote to Stalin personally
as a result of vhich, vithin less than 4 weeks, he was offered 4-5 _
different jobs. The positicus vere offered to him by the Moscow
Comittee of the CP to whos “Stalin hsd forvarded the letter". In
reply to my query, Subject admitted that he was not concerned that,
by writing to Stalin, be would come to the attention of the Soviet
punitive organs, MVD/MGB, which would undertake to investigate his
case. Accordingly, on 1 April 1950 Subject was given a Job as an

qe After he lost his jod in 1949 with the Moscow Sov=t, he states
that bis relations vith his vife went from tad to worse end ultizstely

1950 or 1951. Hovever, within less than one month of their carriage,
Subject divorced her as he found out that she vas a “tad person" and
because he "had falies blindly in love" vith ker. (EOTE: This aspect
of Sutject's story ¢isturted him very much. Se was wisure of Limsel*,

re In ca 1954 (dates vazue) Subject entered the Institute of
Marxisn-Leninism an? continued his studies for three or more years.
Though be registered for the evening sessions, he deveted a good
portion of his days to study. As 8 result, Subject sgain admitted
to the undersigned tast he actually was ins unique position of being
able to do alxost as te “wished and desired” although ostensibly be
was a full-time exployee of the Bauman District Road Department. While
a student at the Institute of Marxisc-Leninism, Sudject sad his wite
began submitting spplications for a visa wo visit Sudject's parents
in the USA. In actual fact, Sudject states, bis real purpose in
spplying for the visa was to “defect” upoa his arrival in the USA.
In February 1955 Subject states that be vas “fired” from his job
with the Bauman District because of “political unrelietility”. Hevever,
Subject admitted to the undersigned that the real reasoa for dismissal

14-0000

must kave been otherwise as, had be actually been dismissed for
“political unreliability", ke would not have been able to continue
his studies at the Institute cof Mercien-Leninion.

8. Because Subject had cammicated to his father, using
“hidden phrases" in their letters ts each other, about his wish to
leave the USER, Subject's father arrived in the USSR in 147 in
order, Subject states, "to esteblisz at first hand for hizsel?”
whether Subject really wished to “cefect to the U5A". Sudsect's
father remained in tae USSR for e total of 10 days. As a result
of hig father's visit, Subject Changed | his tactics and tezan to
subeit e@pplications for “immigration” to the USA. As eariter, these -

several tines each year.

t. After be left the Rauwzan District place of exployment in
February 1555, Subject founé work as a “free, lance trenslater for
the Mosccw Torgovaya Faiata. Se earned ca UO rubles yer ucnth

translation of Enslish lensuace sanmuets oa technical equirment.
Again, Subject edmitted that his work was “urusual™ as, in actual
fact, he spent 1-2 cays at work, spent the rest of his tine at hom,
and cevoted most of his time end exerpy to the studies at the
Institute of Marxism-Leniniss. Eis salary continued at 1100 rubles
per month.

uw. In August 1958 his work came to an end. Generally he
provided a contardictory acccurt in this respect. Initially he .
stated that the position had deen eliminated but then chanced this
story to state that he resiqmed tn August 1955 as he voul have had
to begin cevoting his full tise to the vorx. In any case, his
Tesigzation generally coinc*ded with his completion of stixites at
the Institute of Marxisn~Lleninisz. ‘Thereafter, and umtil his
imxigration to the USA in. 192, Sabject held no full tice job.
FKonetheless, he states that be succeeded in earning no less than
about 11C0 rubles rer rauth by working as a free lance trenslator
for the Torgovaya Palata of Moscew. Ee turned over to the undersigned

ke Scoject is aware that the story of his "iemicration™ to .
the UGA is also weak. Ze tried to explain this avay by stating that’
ke “got cut by mistake", that be was percitted to ep “to hide the
Soviet shame surromding the Cuban crisis", that "someone had
camittec en error”, etc. He admitted that there exists no other
explanatica es to why the Soviet goverment vould heve permitted
him to leave the USSR as, in the eyes of the Soviet gcversment, he
wes a full flecge? and respensible Soviet citizer who had no
genuine or legitizate clain to American citizenship. 43 a result,
Subject is wiusually sensitive to this topic.

5. COMLISICN:

a. In the opinion of the udersigned, Subject should ao} be
consideres for either ASSCHZ2N cr AMEXFLORS despite tke fact both
bis Pnglish and Russisn are native.

be Om the basis of the interview, the uidersigned feels that,
Subject is lees then frenk and that be is prevaricating. Moreover,

i there exist immuwerable itexrs in Subfect's tale which are indicative
both that he vorked as e rezrufted acent of tte KGB (axi its

had never nanseé in an appiieation for Soviet citizenship. Due to this,
and because I was in a rush to leave the country, I atsived axm on 2
Soviet foreign passport. In the U. S. Enbdassy in Ecseow I filled in si-
xultaneously two applications for entry into the Ue Se Ae t
