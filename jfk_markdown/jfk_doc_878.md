Re: JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992

Dear Mr. Tunheim:

This will respond to your 14 September 1998 letter regarding
Central Intelligence Agency compliance with the “JFK Act.”

I have no doubt whatsoever that the CIA has fully met its
obligations to locate, review, and release “assassination
records" as defined in the JFK Act. The Agency's 2 September
1998 Declaration of Compliance-signed, as you note, by CIA's -
Director of Information.Management, Edmund Cohen-confirms my
judgment. I have full confidence in the scope of the Agency's
searches as described in Mr. Cohen’s recent declaration.

As Director of Information Management, Mr. Cohen is directly
responsible for CIA‘s records systems and for ensuring the
adequacy of CIA's search, review, and release of documents under
the JFK Act. Mr. Cohen signed the Agency’s Declaration of
Compliance because he was the most senior Agency official with
direct personal knowledge that its statements were accurate and
complete. There was no more appropriate signatory.

In sum, I understand that the appropriate CIA staff cfficers
have worked diligently to locate and disclose to the JFK Board
‘all relevant records in the Agency’s possession and that they do
not believe any other relevant records are being withheld from
the Board. Mr. Cohen’s declaration confirms my understanding.
I trust that this will meet your requirements.

Sincerely, ;

George J. Tenet

Universe and Scope of CIA Documents

Addressed Related to the JFK Assassination

Summary. This Attachment discusses CIA material
examined in order to fulfill the requirements of the JFK
Assassinations Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act). It
addresses the types of CIA documents found in the records of
earlier investigations, including that of the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, and materials and files
recovered in response to searches conducted in 1992 and
thereafter. It discusses the process by which documents
became “assassination-related records.”

Discussion. The Central Intelligence Agency has
provided large numbers of documents and materials over the
years in support.of successive reviews and investigations
related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
We estimate that the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages
comprise the “CIA collection” of documents associated with
prior assassination reviews, including duplicates. In
addition, we estimate that in responses to the JFK Act, CIA
has reviewed over 100,000 pages of documents from the
National Archives, the Ford, Johnson, and Kennedy
Presidential Libraries and miscellaneous papers from the
National Security Council, the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), the Rockefeller
Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States, and
the Senate Select (Church) Committee to Study Governmental
Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.

The documentation exists in many forms, from original
contemporaneous material, such as field reporting from
overseas or analytic reports, to material generated
specifically as an Agency response to investigation
questions. The largest “CIA collection,” .as such, is
associated with the records of the House Select Committee on
14-00000

Assassinations (HSCA).? The HSCA brought together in one
place in 1978 the principal documents retrieved over the
course of years from earlier investigations, including the
Warren Commission, the Rockefeller Commission, and the
Church Committee. .

The Warren Commission in 1963 and 1964 was the first
major review of the JFK Assassination. Existing records
suggest that CIA provided roughly 4,000 pages of
documentation to the Warren Commission review, plus
testimony by Richard Helms and John McCone. The Warren
Commission pursued matters related primarily to events and
actions directly associated with the assassination event,
including materials from CIA’s Mexico City Station, which
were considered relevant because of a visit to Mexico City
by Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the assassination.

The Rockefeller Commission in 1975 and Church Committee
investigation in 1975 and 1976 were focused on allegations
of wrongdoing by the CIA. Nonetheless, as a part of these
investigations they yielded information which, to many,
appeared to relate in some way to the assassination, such as
an operational capability or willingness to consider
assassination as an intelligence method. .

From 1976 through 1979 the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA) pursued additional leads, generating
still further documentation. The HSCA ultimately brought
together within its broad scope of investigation many of the
documents from the Warren Commission, the Rockefeller
Commission and the Church Committee. This collection
ultimately became the “HSCA sequestered collection,” which
altogether contains an equivalent of over 300,000 pages, in
paper, photographs, tapes, and microfilm media, including
duplicates. Because the myriad conspiracy theories included
possible Soviet, Cuban, Mafia or right-wing American
involvement, the scope of the HSCA investigation included
anything or anyone that might appear to support those
theories, including historical institutional behavior
patterns. Further, although this sequestered collection was
considered to be CIA’s, it contains documents from other
agencies, primarily the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and over 30,000 pages of HSCA originated material.

, The HSCA sequestered collection reflects the major corpus of CIA material or
information reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (or to
which they had access) during the 1976-1979 time frame. The pulling together
of this collection was coordinated by the Committee and they defined what it was
to include. This Collection has been physically held by CIA since 1979,
although CIA was not authorized access until 1992, when permission was given by
Congress to review the material in preparation for responding to the JFK Act.
14-0000

The HSCA sequestered collection is contained in 64
boxes of multimedia material, including paper, photographs,
and microfilm which have been loosely organized into major
categories of information. Boxes 1 through 34 are mostly
material collected by the CIA’s Directorate of Operations,
the FBI, and other Government agencies, including field
reporting and handwritten notes. They also include
newspaper articles, name traces performed in response to
requests by the HSCA staff, and copies of other documents
such as the CIA Inspector General’s 1967 report on CIA plots
against Castro and Richard Helms’ executive session
testimony before the HSCA.

Boxes 35 through 63 of this collection are largely
records of CIA’s Legislative Counsel, Inspector General,
General Counsel, Office of Security, and Directorate of
Science and Technology, as well as internal records of the
HSCA staff. They consist of reports, memoranda,
transcripts, cables, letters, newspaper clippings,
photographs, and charts. Box 64 contains 72 reels of
microfilm—the equivalent of roughly 72 more boxes of paper
documents. This material includes the file which the
Directorate of Operations maintained on Lee Harvey Oswald
(the 201 file) as well as similar files on additional
individuals. Many of the microfilm documents duplicate
other documents in the other boxes.

While not a part of the sequestered collection, a
separate “Oswald 201 File” has served as a CIA repository
for JFK assassination-related material over the years and to
a large extent material in this file is duplicative of
material in the sequestered collection. Only a few
documents were in the file at the time of the assassination.
The bulk of the approximately 26,000 pages currently in this
file consists of documents collected immediately after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission
investigation. Included are a large number of third agency
documents, primarily from the FBI. Other major additions to
the Oswald 201 file include relevant Mexico City Station
files and material generated by various FOIA requests and
investigations, such as that of New Orleans District
Attorney, James Garrison.

Assassination-related materials beyond the sequestered
collection and the Oswald 201 file which have been located
since 1992 generally fall into three categories. First,
there are new documents which have been generated since
1978, such as defector reports that mention rumors or
perceptions of conspiracies or newspaper or other open
14-0000

source materials related to an individual associated with
the assassination. Second, in a number of cases targeted
areas of inquiry or more precise definitions of areas of
interest by the JFK Board have yielded more information and
added documents to the collection. And third, improved
search techniques have provided better access to those files
which are searchable electronically. Nonetheless, the
material located since 1992 is quite small when compared to
the material in the sequestered collection and the overall
set of material from CIA which has been designated as
“assassination records” by the JFK Board.

In accordance with the law, the Board has the authority
to designate records which it considers relevant to the
assassination as “Assassination Records.” These documents
are then subject to review for declassification or, as
deemed appropriate by the Board, held for declassification
in the year 2017. The Board has designated the entire
sequestered collection as Assassination Records as well as
selected material generated in the course of searches
subsequent to 1992. The entire set of these documents is
the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages, including
duplicates. .

, ATTACHMENT II.

Search Methodology and Types of Searches Conducted

'

Summary. This Attachment discusses the methodologies
used in conducting the searches, including what we know of
the searches which were conducted on behalf of the earlier
assassination investigations. It includes, in referenced
tabs, documentation of selected taskings. It discusses the
Gistributed nature of CIA's paper recordkeeping systems and
electronic databases and the custom keyword searches that
are used with electronic databases which CIA maintains.

Discussion. The collection of CIA materials contained
in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) ©
“sequestered collection” has existed as a discrete body of
records since 1978. This material resulted from highly
labor intensive and systematic searches by individuals

\ familiar with the Agency’s paper files and records systems

, in use in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the sequestered
collection comprises the great bulk of CIA-originated .
documents which can be associated with the JFK Assassination
and related investigations. ‘

For most of its history, the Agency has had a system of
records which has been shaped by the divergent requirements
of the directorates in accordance with the wide variance of
focus in their missions. These basic differences in the
missions of the directorates, as well as the compartmental-

- ization-of-information procedures (the “need-to-know”
concept), have resulted in each directorate keeping its own
set of records in accordance with directorate-specific
guidelines. This applies equally to paper records as well
as to electronic databases.’

Since the late 1970s, the Agency has been in the
process of converting to electronic databases, which allow
for electronic searches for documents using keyword and

2 Even within a single database, information may--in accordance with information

compartmentalization requirements based on the need-to-know principle--be stored
in separate files by several offices or divisions, each with its distinct

{ recordkeeping criteria and access requirements. In order for a search to be

a thorough, a search for one term or a combination of terms must be conducted
across all such files.
14-0000

other indexing tools which provide much more expedited and
efficient searches. Because the most significant portion of
JFK assassination-related material was generated prior to
this conversion to electronic databases, searches of the
sequestered collection or other contemporaneous CIA records
have had to rely primarily upon labor intensive hand
searches.

Since 1992 and the passage of the JFK Act, CIA has, in
responding to the requests of the Board, had to devise
search methodologies and techniques to address both the hard
copy and electronic versions of our databases. With respect
to the hard copy material, Agency efforts have concentrated
on those component records most likely to yield
assassination-related documents. Short of a complete manual
review of all documents in the Agency, the techniques used
for searching hard copy materials include expert reviews of
file series and folder names, including associations with
known related topics, retrieving boxes of files from the
Agency’s Archives and Records Center, and manually reviewing
those files identified as likely to contain the sought after
materials.

Electronic files searches can actually be more complex
than manual searches, in major part because of the number of
different electronic systems in use. The Directorate of
Operations’ electronic databases, for instance, include most
cables since 1978 and they can be searched using single or
multiple search terms against the full text of these cables.

_ The Directorate of Intelligence’s automated systems include

original source material used for analytic assessments as
well as the products themselves and can be searched through
a variety of electronic techniques. The DCI Area
(considered, for this purpose a directorate) maintains the
Executive Registry files which are not normally retrievable
through full text search, but by index searches. The
Directorate of Administration maintains a large and diverse
system of databases and files on employees and contractors
that includes data on security issues, medical records,
training, etc. The Directorate of Science and Technology
and its subordinate components maintain other electronic
databases unique to individual missions. Each of these
systems requires a unique set of access criteria and search
commands and must be searched by information management
experts of the respective directorates. °

Where possible, automated systems were searched using
key words such as JFK, Kennedy, assassination, executive
action, Oswald, place names, and a large number of names,
crypts, or pseudonyms identifying individuals known to have
14-00000

. been associated with countries, key installations,
} organizations, or operations that fell within the period
deemed relevant to the history of the assassination.

The following categories are examples of the guidelines
for relevancy with which both manual and computerized”
searches were conducted. They include, but are not limited -
to, individuals, organizations, places, projects, and
subjects which are considered central to the Oswald/JFK
assassination history and the ensuing investigations.

Prior to enactment of the JFK Act, in early 1992, the
Chief of the CIA History Staff, through various manual
searches of shelf lists, located the “sequestered
collection” of the House Select Committee on Assassinations
(sixty-four record center size boxes). After obtaining the
permission of the Congress, his staff surveyed these and
other related holdings on the assassination. In addition,
the History Staff located sixteen boxes ‘of Lee Harvey
Oswald's 201 file and a number of loose folders, mainly from
Mexico City Station records that had been collected for the
Warren Commission. :

In October 1993, following enactment of the JFK Act but
prior to the President’s appointment of the Board, CIA’s
Historical Review Group (HRG) requested the directorates to
conduct a name search on Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK
assassination, and any related documents (Tab 1). This
request resulted in a series of meetings and discussions
with various Agency components and Information Release
Officers. More than thirty-one additional boxes of
materials were sent to HRG for review. Included in this
material were nimeteen boxes of JFK working files of Mr.
Russ Holmes, a CIA employee who for many years was the
Agency’s focal point officer with responsibility for
responding to questions related to our assassinated-related
records. Also included were two boxes on Nosenko, seven
boxes of Latin America Division documents, and three boxes
from the Bay of Pigs project. Out of these thirty-one
additional boxes provided to the Board staff, approximately
twenty-two boxes of material were designated by the Board as
assassination records. The preponderant volume of these
records is duplicative of documents in the sequestered
collection.

In April 1995, after the Agency received the Board's
first formal request, and in anticipation of “what are
14-0000

likely to be many requests from the Board for information...”
the Agency Executive Director asked each directorate and the
DCI Administrative Officer to appoint a focal point officer
for the JFK Assassination review. (Tab 2)

In the spring and summer of 1997, the Agency arranged
for the Board staff to receive a series of briefings by
representatives of each directorate on the files kept within
the records systems of each directorate. These briefings
covered aspects of the records systems, such as how the
records are organized, maintained, searched and retrieved,
as well as how they had been previously searched for
assassination-related materials.

The Board staff requested a number of additional
searches, which have now been completed. - These requests
were both formal and informal and resulted in responses to
the Board staff which included a wide range of additional
material, some of which was judged relevant to the history
of the assassination. This material includes the histories
of various CIA operations and Agency components, files on
specific individuals involved in either the Warren
Commission or in HSCA investigations, and the results of CIA
internal reviews of programs and operations. Although many
requests from the Board and responses from the Agency were
handled informally, the significant initial requests are
Listed in the table in Attachment V.

Prompted in part by the surfacing of a small number of
new relevant documents, the Board staff requested CIA in the
summer of 1998 to: (a) perform an additional set of searches
on certain specific topics; and (b) issue an Agency-wide
notice reminding CIA employees of the requirements of the
JFK Act.

Specially tailored tasking was sent to the three

‘Directorate of Operations components deemed most likely to

possess records relevant to the JFK assassination of the
kind of concern to the Board (See Tab 3). Among other
considerations, this special tasking included a list of new
or revised search terms, a request for clarification on the
disposition of the James Angleton files, and the requirement
to focus on potential new information from the debriefing of
defectors in which any reference to Oswald or to the Kennedy
assassination occurs. .

DCI Tenet issued an Agency-wide Employees Bulletin on
22 July 1998 directing all CIA personnel to “consider
documents in their possession or with which they are
14-0000

familiar that might have relevance to the Board’s review...”
(EB OIM 98-02—See Tab 4).

Finally, and in a separate tasking, all directorates
were asked to assure that searches undertaken were
sufficient to enable a directorate representative to provide
a certification of compliance with the JFK Act, and that the
DCI’s Bulletin had been forwarded to all directorate
employees. (See Tab 5). :

FINAL DOCUMENT SEARCH TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH "PRESIDENT JOHN
F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992" (JFK ACT)

FROM: George J. Tenet
Director of Central Intelligence

1. (U) As you know, the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (Board) is completing
its task of overseeing the search and declassification of all Federal government records relating to
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy by 30 September 1998. The Board and we want
to do everything possible to place before the American people the full story as reflected in
government and other records.

2. ' (U) The Agency has been working on this effort since 1992 and has searched all of the
obvious databases. We want to make certain that we have left no stone unturned and that no
employee has any records that might possibly be considered relevant to the assassination—
including any records created [or received] after 1992. The reference to 1992 is largely intended
to encompass documents which may have come into our hands since the collapse of the Soviet
Union and Warsaw Pact.

3. (AIUO) In accordance with the provisions of the JFK Act, I hereby direct all CIA
personnel to consider documents in their possession or with which they are familiar that might

. have relevance to the Board’s review and that might not have been found in the course of

electronic or manual searches over the past six years. Representatives of the Historical Review
Program believe that if such documents do exist they would, most likely, be found in files that
would not be generally related to the assassination or that would not be “logical” areas for
systematic searches. These include working paper files or smaller databases related to countries
not normally associated with the assassination. Relevant documents can be in the form of papers,
photographs, recordings, tapes, or other media, and can include documents “related to the
assassination,” such as later investigations, key topics/events within the Oswald/JFK Story, or
material related to key figures—such as Nosenko.

4. (AIUO) CIA personnel who believe they have information regarding documents relevant
to the JFK review that may not have been found in previous searches should contact their
component or directorate IRO or the JFK Project Coordinator. Directorate IROs and the

Attachment III

Records Declassified and Released. -

Summary. This Attachment discusses the process used by
CIA to declassify JFK assassination-related documents,
including interaction with the Board and subsequent re-
reviews of materials, as well as the personnel resources
engaged in this effort. It discusses the volumes of records
reviewed, the volumes of records declassified, and the
manner in which the material has or will be aade available
to the public.

Discussion. In response to the enactment of the JFK
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 and in
anticipation of the appointment of the Review Board, CIA,
during 1992 and 1993, reviewed for declassification material
which had been sequestered following the investigation of
the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1978.
As a result of this effort, CIA released as declassified to
the National Archives in August 1993 some 127,000 pages of
material from this collection. Since that time, additional
releases have been made; approximately 74,000 pages from the
microfilm part of the collection were declassified and
released in August 1994 and 30,000 pages of HSCA originated
material were declassified and released in 1995. We
estimate that, since 1992, CIA has devoted over 100 work
years to its effort to respond to the JFK Act (including

‘experienced annuitants working as independent contractors).

The development of the declassification review
methodology was, from the beginning in 1992, an iterative
process that took into account both the requirements of the
JFK Act to release to the public information relevant to an
understanding of the assassination and the DCI's statutory
mandate to protect intelligence sources and methods under
the National Security Act of 1947 and the CIA Act of 1949.

In the years since 1992, considerable effort has been
expended to balancing these two objectives. Interaction
with the Board’s staff was a significant factor in reaching
this proper balance. The net result is that practices over
this period evolved to the extent that types of material
that had been redacted at the beginning of the process were,
by the end, no longer considered necessary to withhold.
This has, of course, required a further re-review of the
material released during the earlier period to assure that
14-0000

consistent standards were being used for the entire
collection.

Each document in the collection was read by an

Historical Review Program (HRP) Reviewer -- in every case a
retired officer with at least two decades of Agency
experience -- who examined every word in the document with

an eye toward releasing documents unless such release could
be expected to cause damage to:

e Human intelligence assets or their families;

e Intelligence methodology clearly requiring continued
protection;

e Intelligence operations or activities warranting
continued protection, including relationships with
foreign governments.

The reviewed documents were then passed to teams of
officers from the components that generated the documents
(in most cases the Directorate of Operations), who were
responsible for determining current sensitivity. The senior
HRP reviewers validated the component groups’ actions prior
to forwarding the materials to the Board.

Names of CIA employees who served all or most of their
careers under cover posed particular problems and, while
many names have been redacted, with Board concurrence for
release at a later date, the current sensitivity, or lack
thereof, of retired individuals’ employment by CIA had to be
checked in each case. Names of key players in the post-
assassination scenario, as stipulated by the Board, were
released as true names or with temporary and traceable
substitute names. Identification by the Board of those who
were considered key players was a complicated and time-
consuming task. Significant review and analysis went.into

- the decision to release true names of many Cubans connected

with the Bay of Pigs.

Material from the Rockefeller Commission and Church
Committee investigations, presidential libraries and PFIAB
files which addressed the entire scope of CIA activities
raised issues with respect to relevance to the JFK
assassination. For example, Project MONGOOSE, a clandestine
portion of the publicly acknowledged U.S. anti-Castro
policy, was released.

Another major issue was consistency in reviewing
duplicate copies of documents. In one case 47 copies of a
cable were found by different reviewers in separate files
14-0000

ee

over the six years of our review process. The National
Archives ground rules called for release of every copy for
inclusion in the NARA collection; therefore, each of these
47 copies is included as part of the total collection. As
duplicate copies were found, comparison with. the 1993.
released version revealed not only inconsistencies but
textual phrasing which, in a mosaic of related documents,
made likely the identification of a protected individual or
action. As a result, much re-review of the files was
required and did occur. -

Another time-consumer was the question of the
identification of overseas station locations, traditionally
not revealed--both to protect Agency individuals, activities
and sources and to avoid foreign relations difficulties with
foreign governments. In these cases, a window of time for
acknowledgment of such facilities was negotiated, directly

relevant to such actions as Oswald’s travels and post-

assassination requests for foreign government assistance in
the U.S. investigation.

Except for redaction of names of CIA employees, true
names of clandestine agents (otherwise identified with
traceable cryptonyms), and currently~sensitive cooperation
with specific foreign intelligence services, the final
collection in the National Archives will contain very
limited redactions and, in our opinion, none that would
affect an historian’s understanding of the Agency's
information on, and relevance to, the event.

ATTACHMENT IV.

Perceived Gaps _in CIA Records

Summary. This Attachment addresses the Board’‘s
requested explanation for the apparent absence of files
which are known to have existed (or for which there is some
evidence that they existed at one time) but cannot now be
located. Specifically, the Board asked for such information
on-the following: Oswald files; certain files of James
Angleton; DCI McCone files; William Pawley; and Win Scott.
This Attachment also addresses the Board’s request that the
Agency's Declaration “...identify any other records relating
to Oswald or the assassination that CIA knows to have been
destroyed or removed from CIA files.”

Discussion.
Files on Lee Harvey Oswald

(a) The Office of Security (OS) maintained a pre-
assassination subject file on Oswald. This file contained
newspaper articles and reports from other government
agencies. As would be expected, the number of volumes of
the subject file grew following the assassination. The pre-
assassination material remained in volume one and subsequent
Material was filed in volumes numbered II through VI.
However, during a February 1997 search, no volume V was
found. A second thorough search of the OS file system
failed to produce any record of Volume V. A careful page-
by-page review of the contents of the existing volumes
revealed there is no time gap in the material. Therefore,
it is believed the label on Volume VI is simply incorrect;
it should have been labeled Volume V. .

The OS Oswald subject file was reviewed by the HSCA in
1978; however, it was not stored with the rest of the
sequestered material. There is no documentation on why this
file was not incorporated into the sequestered collection
held by the DO; eight boxes of non-Oswald OS files were in
the collection. The Oswald Security File has been reviewed,
declassified, and released to NARA.

(b) There has been considerable interest over the years in
locating any electronic surveillance tapes that would have
been made during the period that Oswald visited Mexico (26
September - 2 October 1963). A thorough search has been
conducted of the DO’s record system as well as the index to
retired records in an attempt to locate any tapes and/or
find documentation to resolve their disposition. We have
Giscussed this issue with operational experts and their
14-00000

professional opinion is that most likely such tapes were
never returned to Headquarters for retention. It was normal
practice to recycle audio tapes after they had been listened
to by transcribers and their transcripts made.

Messages between field stations and headquarters used
operational jargon and shortened sentence structures that
can sometimes allow for misinterpretations. Thus, possible
confusion was created when references to what was being sent
to headquarters referred to “tapes” but really intend
“information” from tapes.

In our search efforts we did locate approximately 185
audio surveillance tapes of the Cuban and Soviet embassies _
in Mexico City that were recorded during the immediate time
following the assassination (22 November 1963 to January
1964). The fact that these tapes were retained and returned
to Headquarters could account for the fact that some people
recall that some tapes existed which were sent to
Headquarters.

Based upon the search efforts that were undertaken and
the opinions of operational experts consulted, CIA has
concluded that the tapes in question do not exist and were
almost certainly recycled in the normal course of business
before their potential value was identified.

James J. Angleton (Chief, CounterIntelligence Staff, 1954-
1974)

As noted in a 24 August 1998 memo to the Board, the
files of Mr. Angleton were incorporated within the files of
the CI Staff and the Directorate of Operations. Three
memoranda, dated 23 November 1976, 5 August 1977, and 29
November 1979, detail the review and incorporation into
the DO Central Records System of the Angleton files as well
as all the files found in CI Staff following Mr. Angleton’s
departure. As a result of this review and incorporation of ©
files, there is no identifiable collection of Angleton
files. The three memoranda mentioned above have been
included in the Agency’s JFK collection for processing and
release to NARA.

John McCone (Director of Central Intelligence, 1961-1965)

Within the McCone papers are several file folders with
notations that indicate documents are missing. However,
each folder has an index of the documents that were
originally within it. Of all the missing documents only two
refer to the Kennedy assassination. One document is
described as “Date of Meeting - 26 Nov; Participants - DCI &
14-0000

Bundy; Subjects Covered - Msg concerning Pres. Kennedy's
assassination.” The second document is described as “Date
of Meeting - 19 May ‘64; Participants - DCI, J.J. McCloy;
Dinner at Residence - Re: Oswald. [The latter is annotated:
“Destroyed 1-28-72."]

Both documents were noted as missing when the files
were reviewed by the CIA History Staff in November 1986.

William Pawley (Industrialist; friend of DCI Dulles and
supporter of Anti-Castro activities)

The JFK collection contains a 201 file on Mr. Pawley
that ends in 1962. The Directorate of Operations determined
that material through 1965 that should have been in the 201
file was filed in an operational file. Most of the material
was already within the JFK collection. The Board staff
reviewed all the documents within the operational file and
selected additional documents for inclusion in the JFK
collection. This material will be processed for release to
NARA. -

Win Scott (Chief of Station, Mexico City, 1956-1969)

The Agency’s Retired Record Table (RRT) shows Mr.
Scott’s Mexico City files were retired as Job 78-00594R on
11 August 1972. These records were retired to the Agency’s
Archives and Records Center under Item Number 40-76 in the
DO Records Control Schedule in effect at that time. Files
under Item Number 40-76 were described as:

“Temporary. Destroy upon completion of a specific job
or as they serve their purpose. Return folders and

documents on loan and destroy remaining papers.’

The RRT shows Job 78-00594R was destroyed on 12 January.

-1987, based upon reference to Item Number 40-76 of the’

Records Control Schedule.

The RRT page showing the disposition of Mr. Scott’s
files and the page of the Records Control Schedule which
describes Item Number 40-76 have been incorporated in the
Agency's JFK collection and will be processed for release to
NARA.

Certain Station Files

Within the Board's guidance for CIA’s compliance
declaration, the Board asked that the Agency specifically
address the existence, non-existence or destruction of files
14-0000

from two stations in its Final Compliance Statement. The
two stations in question are Mexico City for the period
1963-1964, and Moscow for the period 1959-1962.

It has been long-standing practice and policy that
materials that the DO keeps in the field are for immediate
operational needs, and that record materials are to be
returned to Headquarters for safekeeping. Limited storage
space overseas as well as the risk of physical loss in the
event of civil unrest or the need for evacuation are
contributing factors to this policy. Once at Headquarters,
these materials are normally organized by topic or subject
rather than by station because this is the way that work is
performed. Particularly with paper records and the passage
of significant time, it is extremely difficult if not
impossible to reconstruct with any confidence, a full set of
documents for any particular station.

We do know that files from Mexico City Station are .
listed in the documents found in the sequestered collection
and the Oswald 201 file materials. This divergence from
normal practice with respect to these files can be explained
by the obvious high interest of the Warren Commission in the
events in Mexico City surrounding the time of the assassin-
ation (as shown by the fact that they are contained in the
Warren Commission materials). It would not have been normal
practice at the time for the Agency to keep these records in
this form. Thus, other than the materials in the sequest-
ered collection and the Oswald 201 file, we have been unable
to identify collections of records which would represent
files for the two stations for the periods requested.

HTLINGUAL

The Church and Pike Committees both expressed concern
about HTLINGUAL, a mail opening project which held
information on American citizens. As a result of these
investigations, CIA was directed by court order to destroy
all HTLINGUAL material. It is reasonable to believe that an
HTLINGUAL file existed on Lee Harvey Oswald; however, along
with all other files designated as HTLINGUAL files, it would
have been destroyed in accordance with the court order.
Within the JFK sequestered collection, there are HTLINGUAL
materials on Oswald -- materials which were apparently
copied from the HTLINGUAL files before they were destroyed
in accordance with the court order. It is not possible,
however, to say that everything on Oswald that was held in
the HTLINGUAL file wound up in the JFK collection. (See Tab
2 of Attachment V for more details.)

Records Relating to Oswald or the Assassination known _to
have _ been destroyed or removed. :

In November 1997, the Information Management Officer of
the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) advised that he
had discovered a record which indicated a file that referred
to the Kennedy assassination had been destroyed on “5/1/95”.
A search for information on this document revealed that the
document had been created in 1977 and was described as
“allegations regarding the Lee Harvey Oswald file.” It was
included with other documents grouped under the description:

“Individual Case Files - Consists of documents
accumulated in investigating complaints, suggestions,
or problems of individuals which are brought to the
attention of the IG. Filed numerically by case number.
Potential cases filed alphabetically.” |

It has been confirmed that copies of the documents were
made available to the HSCA and are in the sequestered
collection. The OIG has reconstructed the file and will
maintain it as a permanent record. Documentation is-
provided at Tab 1.

Specific Requests From the Board -

Summary. The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act
of 1992 mandates a number of specific actions on behalf of
all government departments and agencies. One of these is
to:

“...make available to the Review Board any
additional information and records that
the Review Board has reason to believe it
requires for conducting a review under
this Act.” (Sec. 5(c)2 H.)

In the exercise of this authority under the Act, the Board
made fifty-three specific requests for additional records
and information in the form of sixteen (16) requests
designated as “formal” and thirty-seven (37) designated as
“informal.” On each request, the CIA worked closely with
the Board and Board staff to provide the information and/or
documents requested and a written response which records
such actions.

Discussion. As a part of this Final Declaration, the
CIA‘ has attached at Tab 1 a list of the fifty-three requests
by number and a short description of the subject of each.
At the Board's request this attachment includes at Tab 2 the
specific response to the request numbered CIA-16 (Oswald
Pre-Assassination File)

Beyond the fifty-three requests, the Board raised two
additional matters which tend to fall within the category of
special requests:

1) A request that the Agency review and declassify the
Board’s interviews of former CIA officer and Mexico City
station employee, Anne Goodpasture; the Agency’s response to
that request is complete.

2) A request for Board staff access to sealed
Rockefeller Commission records held by the Library of
Congress; these records were given to the Library by
Rockefeller via a deed of gift which requires a letter from
the DCI before access can be granted. This letter will be
completed by 9 September 1998.

‘Washington, D.C. 20505
24 December 1997

Dr. T. Jeremy Gunn

Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board
600 E. Street, N.W. (2nd Floor)
Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Dr. Gunn:

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records
No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files) and
No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)

This is a partial response to the ARRB‘s referent
request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had
on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is believed the following comments
and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of
Security questions. The DO response is pending.

1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum
containing information from the Agency’s Office of Personnel
Security which provides details about the files it had on
Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they
were created. These include the Office of Security file on
Oswald, a general file on Americans who had defected to
another country and information about HTLINGUAL files.

2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977
memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which
explains the numbering of that Office's file on Oswald. In
particular, it explains why the “missing” volume V may never
have existed...

3. An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald
Security file and the file on American defectors. ~

4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and
those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRB

-staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will

be processed according to current release guidelines.

If you have any questions about this response, please
advise. ‘
Sincerely,

Jd. Barry Harrelsbn

22 December 1997

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. Pursuant to ARRB “Resquet No. CIA-16,the Office of
Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The following
responses are provided to those questions which pertain to
the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are
the best reasonable answers based on available information.
Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to
1 October 1994.

Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as
possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time
of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: At the time of the assassination, the Office
of Security (0S) held two files which contained information
on Lee Harvey Oswald. One file entitled “Defectors File”
(#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and
the second file was Office of Security subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records: - which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.

2. Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file), ©
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search
of Oswald‘s name did not produce an index reference to any
of these files. Attached is all of the available
information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL
files. This information was retrieved from the Information
Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review
of general office administrative files.
14-0000

Question 2: For other than the 201-289248 file on
Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the
purpose for the. opening of the file, and the documents that
were in the file at the time of the assassination.

Response: As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been
Gestroyed. ‘Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

3. HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
involving the opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South
America. In the Office of Security this project was known
as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER,
INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER. The Office of Security actually
conducted the opening and monitoring of mail with the
acquired information being referred to the Directorate of
Operations. ‘

4. The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
defecting to other countries and information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This file contained information was from press clippings,
Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed
services. The pre-assassination documents located in this
file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959
entitled “U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at
15”

b. Department of State memorandum dated 25 @Gctober
1960 with attached list of American “defectors”
from May 1959 to October 1960

c. Memorandum for Chief/Security Research Staff dated
31 October 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject:
American Defectors
14-00000

d. Memorandum for Deputy Director of Security dated
1 November 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject:
American Defectors

e. Handwritten chart of defectors dated 26 August
1961

f. Defector outline prepared in October 1961 listing
known defectors to the USSR; Red China, Cuba, and
United Arab Republic.

5. The index reference to the Defectors File
identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as
the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer
printout of defectors and provided limited biographic data
on each name. This listing was maintained separately from
the actual Defectors File; notations within the Defectors
File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently

charged to the Security Analysis Group of the Office of

Security. Efforts to locate this listing or determine its
disposition have been unsuccessful.

6. Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors
File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.
An employee of this Office was, recalls the Defector Machine
Listing as being approximately one and one-half inches thick
and in two parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical ,
index of defector names with assigned numbers. The second
part listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and
contained the limited biographic data on each name.

7. The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald
(#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file
was created as a separate repository for the numerous press
clippings and reports received from other government
agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR
and his activities following his return to the’ United
States. The first volume of this file appears to have been
preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents
contained in this file are as follows:

a. Department of State telegram #1304 from Moscow
dated 31 October 1959—
¥.
b. The Washington Post press clipping dated
1 November 1959 entitled “Ex-Marine Asks Soviet
Citizenship”

x. ‘Outgoing cable #74830 to Mexico City dated
10 October 1963

y. Incoming cable #47041 from Mexico City dated
24 October 1963 (no mention of Oswald).

Question 4: To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational
charts) that, would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
Maintained such files.

Response: It is believed that OS holdings on ,Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of
14-00000

documents increased, a separate file was created to be the
repository of information on the alleged American defector.
There is a notation in the Defectors File that a separate
file exists on Oswald. '

9. Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.

10. The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the
component responsible for collecting, developing, and
evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to
detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency‘s
organization, employees, and activities by foreign or
domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted
research in connection with employee loyalty cases and
maintained records identifying personalities, environments,
and personal traits of individuals who had been of
counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the
counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using
organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported
directly to the office of the Director of Security.

11. A representataive of the Office of Personnel
Security /Management Staff was queried regarding the mission
and functions of SRS during the pre-assassination time
period. He made inquiries relating to the above request,
and the OPS/Information Management Officer retrieved retired |
policy records for review. The information on the mission
and function of SRS was retrieved from the archived Office
of Security administrative and historical files as well asa
review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens. .

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM: Janet A. Ecklund
Chief, Information Management Branch
Office of Personnel Security

SUBJECT: OSWALD, LEE HARVEY
AIN: 0351164

1. The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31
January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center for the Study
of Intelligence (HRG/CSI), via the Directorate of
Administration/Information Review Office, with researching pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was.
generated by the John F. Kennedy Board’s desire to review and
declassify relevant material. The results of this review were
forwarded to the HRG/CSI on 27 February 1997.

2. During the Information Management Branch’s
(IMB)research in response to the above tasking it was noted that
Volume V of the Oswald files was not on the shelf where Volumes
I-IV and VI-VII were located. A search of the entire area where
the volumes had been maintained failed to locate Volume V. The
IMB Files Section was subsequently charged with conducting an
all out search for the missing volume. The search failed to find
Volume V. :

3. In July 1997, the Oswald files were reviewed page by
page prior to being turned over to HRG/CSI and another attempt
was made to locate Volume V or to locate persons who might know
what happened to it. Volume V was not located nor were any
persons located who were knowledgeable of its status-

4. During the complete review of the Oswald files no
time gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall
ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume V
had been consolidated into other volumes or that Volume V never
existed, but that a numbering error resulted in what should have
been Volume V being labeled as Volume VI. The use of Roman
numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this
error to occur.

DO Response to Board Request CIA - 16
Oswald Pre~-Assassination Files

The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO
records to determine if there were any additional files
containing pre-assassination records relating to
Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald
201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The
document identified CI Staff as the file custodian.

CiIc has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were
incorporated into the 201.

Prior to establishing a 201, any documents received
would have been placed in an operational interest file.
We found no reference to the existence of an
operational file. If such a file had existed, however,
it might not have been registered in the central index.
It was standard procedures that upon opening a 201, the
documents from an interest file would be transferred to
the 201.

Given that Oswald was a subject of the HTLINGUAL
operation, it is reasonable to believe that there was a
file on him. We destroyed all of the HTLINGUAL files
under court order, and no record was.made of what files
existed. We did not review all of the DO record system
to destroy all copies of material which may have been
derived from HTLINGUAL material. We know, for
instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items related to
Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection

In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the
information we are aware of that we had prior to the
assassination.

Attachment VI

Disposition of CIA/HSCA Sequestered Collection and

other Assassination Records.

Summary. This attachment discusses proposed agreements
and understandings between the CIA, the Review Board and
National Archives and Records Administration regarding the
disposition of JFK Assassination-related records held by CIA
which are not already at the National Archives, and the
terms under which those records to be declassified will be
dealt with.

Discussion.
1. “Processing of CIA Assassination Records by September

1998”. Per agreement with the Review Board, the
declassification review of all records, unless specifically
designated for post-September 1998 processing by the Review
Board, in the following categories will be completed and the
releasable version of the records ready for transfer to the
National Archives by September 30, 1998:

© Non-duplicate documents from the CIA-HSCA sequestered -
collection, the Russ Holmes files and the LA Division
working files;

* Documents designated as assassination.records as a result
of Review Board specific requests for additional
information and records (CIA 1-16, CIA-IR 1-37);

e All documents from Lee Harvey Oswald's “A” file and post-
1978 201 file; Oswald’s 201 file and security file and
Marina Oswald’s-201 (microfilm version) have already been
transferred to NARA;

e Any non-duplicate documents discovered in the recent
searches undertaken to ensure full compliance with the
JFK Act; any new documents on Oswald will be added to the
post-1978 part of his 201 file.

2. “Processing of Duplicate Documents and Commitments for

the Future Treatment of Assassination Records”.

e CIA/HSCA sequestered collection duplicates to be
completed and transferred to NARA by September 1999.

¢ Post-September 1998 Discovery of Assassination Records.

Diligent searches have been made and we are aware of no
assassination records being withheld from the Board.
However, given the Agency's decentralized records systems,
it is possible that assassination-related documents will be
discovered in the future. A guide has been prepared for
those officers whose work requires them to review Agency
documents and material (Executive Order Review, FOIA, etc.)
that may be subject to the JFK Act. Any assassination
records that are discovered will be processed according to
JFK release standards and forwarded to NARA. A copy of the
guide is attached. (TAB 1)

e® Referrals not complete by 30 September 1998. The CIA
Proposes that it complete its review and return to
originating agency by April 1999 all unreviewed third
agency referral documents which were received prior to 30
September 1998. To date the following referral have been
identified for possible post-September 1998 review:

a. Army’s Investigative Records Repository (from Review
Board):

File on Alfredo Mirabal Diaz -- 151 pages

b. SSCI -- Church Committee Records -- TBD pages
(to be identified by Review Board staff)

c. JFK Presidential Library:
Records from Robert Kennedy files -- 1484 pages

These documents have not been formally designated as
Assassination Records. The CIA proposes that these be
handied in a manner similar to the John F. Kennedy
National Security Files on Cuba that were reviewed in
1996 by a joint CIA-State-DOD-Review Board task force.

3. ‘ tody_ o IA ination Recor to be Released i

The CIA proposes that the classified versions of Lee
Harvey Oswald's Security File and “A” File along with Marina
Oswald's original 201 be transferred to the protected
(secure) portion of the JFK Collection At NARA by 30
September 1998. The CIA will need to retain custody of the
classified version of the original Oswald 201 and the CIA-
HSCA sequestered collection to complete the review of
duplicate documents by September 1999.

In September 1999, the classified versions of the
Oswald 201 (original and microfilm from the sequestered
collection) will be transferred to NARA. Due to the
sensitive nature of the information in the remaining
sequestered collection, particularly the NBR material, CIA
proposes that the Agency and National Archives work out a
joint custody arrangement that would allow these record to
remain in CIA physical custody until 2017.

-SRERET : Executive Order

8 October 1997
JFK Records Review Project

(U) The following is intended as a guide for those
people whose work requires them to review Agency documents
and materials that may be subject to the President John F.
Kennedy Assassination Records ‘Collection Act of 1992.

Some of the records within the. Agency's JFK collection are
assassination specific, others are ancillary. They deal
with individuals and events not directly linked with Oswald
or the assassination; but they are thought to have had a
relationship to the assassination,or investigation into the
assassination. _

I. The Agency's JFK Collection.

(U) The Agency's JFK records collection is made up
primarily of records pulled together for the Warren
Commission and House Select Committee on Assassinations
(HSCA). There were eighty-one (81) Records Center-sized
boxes in the original collection. Of these, the first
seventeen (17) made up the Oswald 201 file. The next sixty-
four (64) are referred to as the “JFK files” or sequestered
collection and break down as follows: thirty-four (34) boxes
of DO materials; nine (9) boxes of Office of Security files;
fifteen (15) boxes of OLC materials; two (2) boxes each of
OGC and IG materials; and one (1) box of DDS&T documents.
HSCA originated material, including notes by HSCA staff
members, are found throughout the collection. Box 64
contains seventy two (72) reels of microfilm.

~ (U) The microfilm contains copies of complete files to
which the HSCA had access during its investigation. In
addition to the Oswald 201 file (12 reels), the microfilm .
includes: 201 files on Cubans, Americans, and Soviets linked
to Oswald, the JFK assassination or the various :
investigations (approximately 26 reels)and the Cuban
Revolutionary Council and other exile group activities
(approximately 13 reels); the personnel files of CIA staff
employees (approximately 5 reels); and operational files on
organizations, projects, and other subjects of interest to
the HSCA investigation (approximately 16 reels).

14-0000

(U). We continue to identify other collections of documents
that properly belong within the JFK collection. These
include: The Oswald Security File; Agency working files
generated by JFK assassination investigations and requests;
and CIA documents found by other agencies and Presidential
Libraries and referred to CIA for review under the JFK Act.

II. The Time Frame of JFK Assassination Records.

(U) In general, the time frame of JFK records commences
when Oswald arrived at the US air base (the U-2) at Atsugi,
Japan, in December 1957 and continues through the end of the
Garrison investigation in 1968. Note, however, for
information which is clearly related to the story of the JFK
assassination or its investigations, there is no time frame
limitation. Any document or request that deals with the
assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, or the various conspiracy
theories should be referred to the HRG/JFK review project.

Ili. Key Topics, Etc.

(U) Certain individuals, organizations, places,
projects, and subjects are central to the Oswald/JFK story
and the ensuing investigations, which causes a number of
documents with no mention of Oswald or the assassination to
fall within the purview of the JFK Act. Clearly, it is not
possible-to list every category of document which may have
been reviewed and released under the JFK Assassination
Records Act. The following categories contain examples of
information that are considered to be within the JFK
review.

(U) A. JFK Assassination Investigations:

-- Warren Commission, 1963-64
-- James Garrison, New Orleans DA, 1966-68
-- Rockefeller Commission,* 1975; ‘.
-- Church Committee (Senate) ,* 1975-76

. -- House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA),

1976-79

* JFK Assassination, anti-Castro plots and CIA anti-
* Cuban operations only.

B. Key subjects

(S)  -- Moscow Station, Mexico City Station, JMWAVE Station,
and CIA stations in those cities through which
Oswald passed on his way to and from the Soviet
Union, as they related to Oswald's activities or to
possible conspiracies.
14-00000

SECRET

(AIUO) -- CIA anti-Cuban operations 1960-64 (Mongoose, etc.)
if they involve JFK figures (see comment on
Meagher's “index” below); most US anti-Castro
activities in 1963 are considered relevant.

(U) -- Cuban exile anti-Castro activities, leaders and
organizations, 1960-64, if they involve JFK figures.
-- Castro assassination activities (plans and
attempts); no limit on time frame.
-- Mafia, if related to Castro, JFK, or New Orleans
during Oswald time frames (see attached chronology) .

(AIUO)C. Key figures
(the following individuals are considered JFK
assassination-related, unless the context is clearly
unrelated or outside the appropriate time period)

-- AMMUG, Cuban defector;

-- Maurice Bishop, alleged to exist (any reference) ;

-- Silvia Duran, employee in Cuban Embassy, Mexico
City;

-- Richard Gibson and the Free Cuba Committee;

-- Howard Hunt, CIA employee;

~- Priscilla MacMillan Johnson, journalist;

SUBJECT: ayRe: blurb from JFK Board

After reading the note below, | spoke with the GC, who working with Bob Caudle, was seeking to have
included in the Board statement the fact that the DCI had sent a letter endorsing my declaration. |
suggested to the GC that even with this addition, the JFK Board comment would be most unfortunate.
The whole six year effort was designed to put to rest all of the conspiracy theories and this comment
would undercut the effort. in addition, it likely would result in significant additional questions, additional
work for OIM, OCA, OGC and PAS, and put the Agency in a bad light. 1 suggested that | should ask the
EXDIR to sign the declaration. The GC interposed no objection. | then spoke with the EXDIR who agreed
to sign a declaration if this would satisfy the situation. | informed the GC thal the EXDIR was willing to
sign and the GC asked me to inform Bob Caudle, which! did. After you spoke with Judge Tunheim and
got his agreement to: 1) return the Cohen declaration and the DCI letter and substitute the EXDIR
declaration, and 2) eliminate the "blurb," |! had the EXDIR sign the declaration.

! subsequently briefed the DDA, ADDA, and ADDAAS. of the above.

Original Text of Robert D. Caudle
Original Text of Robert D. Caudle

This is what they are going to include in their report, according to fax | just received from Ron Haron:

"The Board has considered release of all CIA assassination records to be critical to successful
implementation of the JFK Act. Accordingly, the Board requested each of CIA's directorates to certify,
14-0000

aoe ADMIMSFRATYEANFERNAL USE ONLY

under penalty of perjury, that they had conducted thorough searches and identified all relevant records.
The CIA refused. The Board then, as an alternative, asked the highest officials of the Agency - - the
Executive Director and General Counsel - - to certify that CIA had met its obligations under the JFK Act
and that no records on Oswald or assassination were withheld. The CIA refused. Instead, the CIA
designated its Director of Information Management to sign CIA's Declaration of Compliance. In the
Board's view, CIA's highest officials should have been willing to certify, under oath, that the Agency has
complied with all the requirements of the JFK Act. The CIA's failure to do so raises serious concerns for
the Board that the CIA has in fact fully complied with the JFK Act.”

Budget _ and Finance

Question 1 - In Cold Warrior Mangold refers to a CIA secret
slush fund which was tightly controlled by Angleton and not
audited by usual procedures. Did the fund exist? Was the fund
audited? Are there any records of CI operational,expenses for
the period 1959-63?

According to C/Financial Service Division (FSD/OFL) who
contacted « former finance officer who was a secretary in CI in
1957-60, to the best of their recolbection Ci did not have their
own finance officer. C/FSD also talked to another officer during
that era who did not recal) that CI was one of the early offices
to do their own certification of expenses. It was his feeling
that there very well may have been a CI fund that was not
handled in the usual way however it is very unlikely to
impossible that any fund wes not audited/certified in some
fashion (i.e. reviewed and certified decentrallyv and only
reported on the books in some aggregate amount). He commented
that he has never in discussion with finance officers heard of an
account managed by starf officers that wasn’t certified by
someone in finance.

Question 2 - Mangold also refers to unnamed CI/BE&F officer
who says he worked for Angleton from 1958-64 and never dealt with
him directly on a single matter. Is there a list of BEF
officers assigned to the CI staff from 1959-63? Do their records
still exist?

OFL - The Career Management Officer stated that we would
need the name of the B&F officer in order to identify if he/she
was assigned to the CI/Stafi. CMO also stated that he does have
some old records during that time period pertaining to
assignments but the list he has is alphabetical by name. The
current procedure is that the soft file maintained in OFL
contains the assignment of each officer in the biographical
profile. ~

HRM - Has microfilm staffing complements for the 1959-63
timeframe. These staffing complements were created ona
quarterly basis and are broken down by the office (location)
level. With the correct directorate/office name we can visually
search these microfilm records, find the correct office and
produce hardcopy reports listing the emplovees on the rolls for a
given quarter. The hardcopy report could be reviewed to break
down the office listing by occupation and create a list of names
associated with the occupation (i.e. B&F officers assigned to CI
from 1959-63. The employee name could then be used to located
current or archived HRM files. CAUTION: 1) If an individual came
14-0000

and left an office during the same quarter they might not appear
on the staffing complement, 2; If an individual was TDY to an
office they would not appear on the staffing complement of that
ffice. 3) If an individual was being paid by their home office
they would not appear on the staffing complement of the outside
office they were supporting.

Question 3 - We have seen DO monthly operational reports
which contain information on the allocation/distribution of
operational funds. Are there other DO or DA records which
reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this
type of information from the early 1960s still be retrieved?

The DO operational fund records would contain expenditures
against a certain project or operation. However, according to
C/FSD the system that preceded the General Accounting System
(GAS) was RCA 501 (not sure what this contained) but in all
probability has been destroyed, would have this type of
information also. More information may have been recorded in 201
files similar to today’s automated systems.

Question 4 - What records are kept on disbursements in the
field? If hypothetically LHO had received money from the Agency
what records would exist?

According to the OFL Records Contrcl Schedule station
accounting containing indi genous personnel are kept for 56 vears,
station accounting not containing indigenous personnel are kept
20 years.

Personnel

Question 1 - What records are maintained on contract
personnel?

Responsibility for records maintained on independent
contract personnel was transferred to OFL o/a 1 October 1996.
Stafi contract personnel files continue to be maintained by HRM.

Office Contract Personnel Files contain many of the same
items found in the staff Official Personnel File (OPF)--
application info, actions (Staff contracts only) clearance info,
secrecy agreement, etc., and also contract info (agreements,
amendments, terminations, etc.) A separate payroll file was also
maintained.

IC‘s - fee for task
Staff Contracts - hired for job--not to exceed 5 years.

Contract files can be opened/maintained/retired in true
name, pseudo, alias or crypt depending upon the sensitivity of
the contract.

Question 1 - For the period between 1955-65, what was the
universe of files that OS had on individuals or groups?

information wnich describes che categories..of.,
uring.this.time frame but it is.impossible to, ....,
il inclusive:

- Usually unsclicited correspondence of crank

counterintelligence interest.

DCD contacts - persons who travel abroad and/or have
ific informetion.

Contractor Employees - industrial contractors with
collateral and/or SCI accesses
Miscellaneous ~- Includes publications, organizations,

intelligence services, etc.
Alien - Foreign nationals who were of interest

New Building - Persons involved with construction of
original Headquarters Buiiding

Regular - Files which included staff employees, contractors; ~
GSA/GSZ, etc.

Question 2 - How are Office of Security records indexed?

Prior to 1964 all index records were maintained on 3x5 inch
index cards. When the information was known, these cards
included names (primary, alias, telecodes), file numbers,
kin/relatives, location/residence, DPOB, citizenship, occupation,
polygraph number, reference source data, information codes,
remarks, SSN, sex, employer, and file retirement data. To locate

file record, the subject of interest was searched in this card
system.

During mid-1964 these index cards with the exception 6f
impersonal entities, were under conversion to a keypunch system.
The impersonals (companies, publications, intelligence services,
organizations, etc.} were maintained on cards until much later,
possibly mid-1970s. Aside form the subject name indices, the
Office of Security also indexed information of interest within a
file record. This information could include associates,
companies, publications, other government agency reports
‘information, etc.

TODAY'S INDEXING PARAMETERS ARE VERY LIMITED.

Question 3 - What was the function of the Office of
Security/Security Research Staff (OS/SRS)? Why were defector
records kept in this component?

.The-Security- Research Staft (SRS) .was. the. component...

responsible..for collecting... developing, . and, evaluating |. .
information of & counterintelligence nature to detect and/or ~

prevent penetration of the Age ncy's organ nization, employees, and
activities by foreign or Gomestic organizations or individual

SRS conducted research in connection with employee loyalty cases
and maintained records identifying personalities, environments,

and personal traits of individuals who had been of

counter: ntelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the counter
intelligence effort throughout OS. SRS reported directly to the
Director of Security. :

Question 4 - In the OS/SRS memo of Oct 31, 1960 written by
Marguerite D. Stevens, the file numbers of several defectors are
listed. What do the MS and EE file prefixed designate? How are
these designations assigned.

As noted in question 1, records were categorized according
to the type and the older file numbers reflected the file
category. “M" designated a miscellaneous record; “S“ designated
a Security Research Staff record. Therefore “MS“ most likely
referred to a miscellaneous record of interest to the Security
Research Staff. “E" or “EE” designations covered subjects of
interest to the Domestic Contacts Division for
information/intelligence purposes. -It appears that at least some
of these alpha designations were converted, to numerical values
circa 1964.

Question 5 - Does OS process security clearances for non-
employees (e.g. sources) to receive access to classified
information? What kind of files are created by this process?
How long are these files maintained.

Security clearances per se are not processed for non-
employees (sources/contacts). The Office of Security conducts
appropriate national agency checks to try to determine the
reliability of those individuals who are of interest for contact
purposes because of their foreign travels, specific scientific
information, etc. In a few instances an ad hoc
clearance/validation may be requested in the event some
classified information would be revealed in the course of
acquiring intelligence from these sources. The validation period
is normally five years, and any files-created are maintained in
the individual‘s name for a period of ten vears after the .
validation period has expired. The DO would most likely have
further information on a particular source.

Question 6 - Where are records that would describe liaison
(etc) cooperation or operations between OS and CI located? How
are these records organized?

suggested that info respon question may possibly be

Question 7 - Where are records “regarding operations that OS
participated in or ran located? For example, where are the OS
records on the Castro assassination attempts?

Records on operations and/or projects in which the Office of
Security was involved in the past have most likely been
destroyed, unless they are maintained because of congressional
Girectives or the records contro! schedules. The Office of
Personnel Security has the capability of retrieving a listing of
any current records with the pref or “project” or “operation”.
Ii the title does not include these words, retrieveal would be
more difficult unless an exact name cr acronym is known for a
particular operation or project.

Question 8 - How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which os
components maintained files on Oswald? Why did OS have any files
on Oswald?

OPS answered in CIA-16. Copy attached.

Jon:
nank For agreeing to participate in briefing the JFK
Besassinats cords Review Board (ARRB) tc be held on Monday,
17 March, at ‘2: 00 p.m., in 2C06 IP Bldg. il regret the short
notice. As we discussed, the ARRB has asked for information
relating to-the creation,’ transmission, and dissémination of
cables and your. name’ instantly came to mind.-“: Their specific
questions are:
i- Can you describe the cable process in place in the Agency
during the
1960-1964 time period?
Prior to 1962 messages were delivered to the DPD
(Development Products Division) at 1717 H Street or to the
Communications Center at “L” Street. In addition there
also was a Q building that received special traffic.
After 1962 messages came into the CIA Headquarters and
were processed in different areas depending on the

types of traffic.

Imagery traffic would be sent to to a specific floor
for the imagery personnel. Intercept and Special Programs
would either be passed to a Special Sections Area of the

Communications Centex oer to the Cable Secretariat.

2- How did cables come in?

Messages came in from the field via the Brandy Station State

Channels or military channels.

a

3- How were they decrypted?
Messages were deciphered using a OTT (One Time Tape)

or a OTP (One Time Pad) process.
14-0000

4- What happened from the time a cabie was sent froma fielg
site until] it arrived
on a desk at Headquarters?

Messages sent from a field site would be passed to a
‘communicator,’ encrypted and transmitted via - - ~ Le es
High Frequency Radio. The message received from Brandy

and relayed to headquarters and then it was decrypted.

The analyst of the Cable Secretariat would then read the
message and match what they read against customer

requirements. They then would have a typist type the
Gissemination on the message. The message then would be

picked up from the message center by the various staffs

and or divisions.

5- How were cables disseminated?
See item four.

Please let me or Becky Rant, DA/IRO, know if you have any
other questions or concerns prior to the briefing.

(U) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
that involved opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South
America. In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with
subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and
SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of
mail with the acquired information referred to the
Directorate of Operations.

(U) The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
defecting to other countries arid information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This compilation of information was received from press
clippings, Directorate of Operations. reporting, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, and the
various armed services. The pre-assassination documents

Depariment of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because cf counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. in the beginning this material was “

probabiy retained in the Defectors File. As the aumber of
documents on this person increased, a separate file ‘was
created to be the repository of information on the alleged
American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors
File that a separate file exists on Oswald.

(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a

REFERENCE: A. JFK Board Request No. CIA-7,

B. CSI-0307/05, dtd 20 Feb 1996, same subject

1. Per your request, I have reviewed the list provided to
me of all histories produced under the CIA History Program for
release to the Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB) .
Regarding equities that concern the Office of the DA, I reviewed
pages 38 through 48 and pages 51-54 and have no problem granting
access to the list except for those noted on page 40, 42, 46,
and 48. If this list is to be provided unclassified, then the
station names as marked would need to be redacted. If this list
is to be provided classified, the DA pages may be passed without
sanitization. :

2. Is the ARRB allowed to request access to any Agency
document if unrelated to the JFK Assassination? We could be
setting a precedent if we grant the ARRB access to see this
entire list. Potentially, the ARRB*could request access to any
number of Agency documents totally unrelated to the JFK
Assassination (i.e. 201 files).

If you have questions, I may be reached on extension -

Bonnie:

This is with respect to your 26 February 1998 nate wherein You asked that we check HRM for personnel files on Ron Cross, Bart
Henry and William Mortis Kent. in an effort to bring the status of this particular tasking (CIA-IR-12) up-to-date, | provide the following:

My records show that on 18 July 1997 Barry requested that we conduct file searches on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross, Bart Henry and
Doug Gupton. We were advised by Barry, artd as outlined in a 22 May 1996 letter from ARRB te John Pereira, that Crass, Henry and
Gupton are pseudonyms used by CIA personnel who testified to the HSCA.

Notwithstanding, we tasked OPS and HRM ta conduct searches on these individuals in an effort to locate files. On 22 December 1996,
(advised Barry that HRM had located files on Ted Shackley and would provide them to Barry via this office once they arrived fram AC. ft
further advised that if in the future you have access to the true names, we will glady search again.

On 23 December 1997, | advised Barry that OPS had located files on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross and Ooug Gupton and that the files were
in OPS for review. They were unable to locate a record on Bart Henry. Itis my understanding that you have not reviewed these files ta
date but are in the process of making arrangements to do so. Sue-Ann Pierson conducted the search back in July and | am certain that —

she will be glad to you in this matter (40000).

And lastly, | have no record of ever having received a request to search on William Morris Kent. Accordingly, { will request OPS and

CSI 97-062 dated 31_January 1997.

i. (J) The Office of Personnel Security has researched
this request from the Assassination Records Review Board
relating to the existence of pre-assassination files on Lee
Harvey Oswald.

2. (U) In response to the specific questions listed --

in Mr. Maxwell’s letter to the Historical Review Group, the
following responses are provided to those three questions
pertaining to the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These
responses are the best reasonable answers based on ‘available
information. Please note OPS was known as the Office of
Security prior to 1 October 1994.

Question 1; (U) Please identify, as specifically as

possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time

of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: (U) t the time of the assassination, the
Office of Security (OS) held two files which contained

. information:on Lee..Harvey Oswald. .A file entitled. Defectors,
File .(#0341008) contained a reference..to.Lee. Harvey..Oswald, -

and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
; Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were

originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was aiso conducted
of micrcfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.

(0) In your request specific mention is made of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project --#0077826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All ci
the HTLINGUAL files wexe destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search cf
Oswald's name did not procuce an index reference to any of

these files.

(U) Attached is all sf the available information
regarding the destruction ci the HTLINGUAL files. This

information was retrieved from Lydia Hoffman of the
Information Management Branch/Records Control Section and
from a review of general office administrative files.

Question 2: (U) Other than for the 201-289248 Zile
on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was
opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and
the documents that were in the file at the time of the
assassination.

Response: (U) As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have
been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological.sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was .
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening

Gates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

(U) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
that involved opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South
America. In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with
subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and
SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of
mail with the acquired information referred to the
Directorate of Opexations.

(U) The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
Gefecting to other countries arid information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This comcilation of information was received from press
clippings, Directorate of Operations, reporting, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, and the
various armed services. The pre-assassination documents
located in this file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

a. Washincton Star press clipping of 26 November 1959

preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents
contained in this file are as follows:

dated 31 October 1955

Question 4: (U) To the extent that Counterintellicence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
Maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSES3)
and to any other materials (including organizationai
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have

maintained such files.
Response: (U0) ieved that OS holdings on. Lee

ith his travel to Russia during
zenship. Oswald was in

contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the

Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the

Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution

of these reports. In the beginning this material was

probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of
documents on this person increased, a separate file was

created to be the repository of information on the alleged aa
American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors

‘File that a separate file exists on Oswald.

(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible. for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.

SUBJECT: Response to CIA-IR-11
Barry & Gary:

! have reviewed the draft response to CIA-IR-11 dated 13 August 1998 and following are my
comments and requested changes:

Paragraphs 1 and 2 - OK

_ Para 2a: EPSTEIN, Edward J. --The DO found no files identifiable with subject; a file was found
on an individual with the same name but: with research, it was determined that the individual was not the
Edward J. Epstein who is the subject of this request. DA searches found a Center for CIA Security,
formerly the Office of Personnel Security, file and a Publications Review Board file on subject, as well as
three “hits" to records destroyed pursuant to normal records destruction schedules. The destroyed
records involved three Freedom of Information requests that mention Epstein's name in the subject line.
None of the requests were for information on Epstein.

Para 2b: LANE, Mark
4th line - Please change Public Affairs to Privacy Act request

Para 2c: MEAGHER, Sylvia — A reference to the fact subject made a Privacy Act request was
found. in addition, the Center for CIA Security found that it had, at one time, a folder on subject and a
1968 Ramparts Magazine article. Both subject's Privacy Act request file and the impersonal folder have
been destroyed pursuant to normal record control schedules.

Para 2d: defer to DO

Para 2e: WEISBERG, Harold

11th line - Please change Office of Security to Center for CIA Security.

{nso far as DA equities are concerned, ! concur with draft letter once the above changes have
been incorporated. -

Frieda,

| have completed searches for Andrew Anderson as Anderson for maximum hits, on Howard
Guebler under Guebler, on Gordon Novel under Novel and Edward Butler under Butler, all last names for
maximum possible hits. My searchs on these four individuals produced no hits, no records, and no
indexed data on one and all.

(note the presumption "Evidently, he (Anderson) was a former employee” because he had a AIN
number of 0 800211. An AIN number is an Agency Identification Number, not necessarily suggesting an
"employee" relationship. An “EIN" is an Employee Identification Number, but what categories of
employment fall under it, I'm not prepared to say.

Andrew (Andy) Anderson in light of the fact that CCS has located a file on one Andrew Clarence Anderson
(AIN 0 800211). Evidently, he was a former employee. | regret that we did not have this information prior

FROM: , J. Barry Harrelson
Senior Reviewer, HRP

SUBJECT: ARRB Request No. CIA-IR-36, For Information
On Processing of Incoming Cables

1. The following and the attachment are responsive to
subject request. The attachment is an extract of the
pertinent text from a memorandum provided by the Directorate
of Operations.

2. If you have any questions concerning this response,
please advise. .

J. Barry Harrelson

FOR YOUR COORDINATION:

Peed wt

Becky Rant, DA/IRO . Date

ova

1. Per the Review Board sta=f‘s request the following,
is a brief explanation of how the Directorate of Operations
(DO) processed cables: in the 1963/1964 time-frame. “As we"
“are ‘unable _to.locate. any’definitive records on the subjec:,

~ arid “in ali probability none ever existed, the information

provided is based solely on the memory of DO officers
familiar with procedures in place at the time.

2. Each area division in the DO maintained and staffed
its own registry. Although each registry was configured to
meet each division’s unique requirements, there were common
functions performed by all the registries to include:
collecting, sorting, and Gelivering of incoming cables;
maintenance of incoming and outge cable “chronos”
collecting and delivering of inco g and outgoing pouch
material; and the issuance and maintenance of “pseudo and
alias” card files.

3. To the specific question regarding processing of
cables, on a daily basis, usually six day per week, each
registry collected its incoming cable traffic from a central
processing point, then called the Cable Secretariate, within
the offi Communicatlors The incoming cables were then
sorted by registry personnel accezéing to pre-defined

guidelines. These guidelines were unique to each division soa

anda were frequently altexed to meet changing operational
requirements. Sorted cables were then delivered to specific
operational/area desks. _A “chrono” copy of each was
maintained, on a temporary basis, usually for 90 days and
then destroyed.

. 4. Outgoing cablés were created and coordinated by
appropriate operational/area desks and usually released by
the chief of the division or a designated releasing officer.
“Released” cables were then hand delivered or sent by
pneumatic tube system ( a system long ago dismantled from
the original Headquarters building) to Cable Secretariate
for processing into the Agency’s communication network.
“Chrono” copies of outgoing cables were forwarded to the
registry for a 90 day hold and then destroyed.

5. It is important to note that the cable scenario
outlined here is general in nature and that throughout their
existence registries and their procedures were frequently
altered until the registry system as Gescribed above was
eliminated in the mid-1930‘s.

Declaration of Teresa F. Wilcox

I, Teresa F. Wilcox, hereby declare and say as follows:

1. (AIUO) I am the Information Review Officer (IRO) for the
Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T). I was appointed to
this position in February 1996, and have held various professional
positions within the Central Intelligence Agency since 1985. I am
responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the
DS&T, to include the Offices of the Deputy Director for Science and
Technology and the Associate Deputy Director for Science and
Technology; the Office of Technical Service (OTS); the Office of
Technical Collection (OTC); the Clandestine Information Technology
Office (CITO); the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS);
the Office of Development and Engineering (OD&E); the Office of
Advanced Analytic Tools (AAT); the Office of Advanced Projects
(OAP); and the Office of Research and Development (ORD). In
addition, I am responsible for searching and reviewing certain
records of the former National Photographic Interpretation Center
(NPIC) .

2. (AIUO) I am aware that the DS&T has searched appropriate
records systems for information responsive to all requests the DS&T
has received. I have obtained this knowledge through my personal
experience, as well my conversations with, and my review of the
records of, the former DS&T IRO Anthony R. Frasketi, and the DS&T
Information Management Officer, Marsha A. Hubbs.

3.  (AIUO) The following is a description of DS&T searches
and review of documents undertaken in _response to Board taskings
the DS&T has received.

CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart. The DS&T made
deletions to security records located by the Directorate of .
Administration. The DS&T Searched ODDS&T records for
Capehart’s medical file. The DS&T forwarded the medical file
to the Board for its review.

CIA-IR-08 Family Jewels Memorandum. The DS&T reviewed a
package of documents forwarded by Barry Harrelson. The DS&T
advised the Board it had no objection to ARRB access.

CIA-IR-15 Electronic ‘take’ from Mexico City Station.
This memorandum addresses the portion of the action, “In
addition, the Board.is still awaiting a response on the
present location of Staff D records. Regardless of the
outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board
continues to seek a full accounting for all surveillance
conducted during the relevant time periods.”
14-0000

In conducting a search for the above information, the
DS&T located in OTS records a file with the folder title,
“Mexico City, Mexico.” We forwarded the entire contents of
that folder for the period 24 May 1961 to 10 June 1965, with
one exception. Three Operational Monthly Reports were
forwarded to the Board. The dates covered were 1-30 September
1963; 1-31 October 1963; and 1-30 November 1963. The
attachment to Dispatch HMMA 20307 dated 4 December 1962 was
not included. It was a poor-quality audio tape in Spanish,
between two individuals talking about office procedures. No
substantive information was exchanged during this
conversation.

The DS&T also conducted a search of OTC records. This
office would have inherited the Division D records of the
Directorate of Operations (DO). We reviewed old DO Records
Retirement Requests; there are no shelflists (folder-
inventory) associated with these Records Retirement Requests
since the Division D records were recorded initially in the DO
system. We forwarded for the Board’s review the six Records
Retirement Request whose job numbers reflected the years 1959
to 1962. We advised the Board that Records Center records
indicated the records’ disposition as follows:

1. 59-S-477: Destroyed September 1977.

60-S-182R: Destroyed May 1980.

60-S-402: Transferred to FI/D(DDO), December 1977.
61-S-157R: Four boxes transferred to FI/D (DDO), March
1972; three boxes destroyed, May 1980.

62-S-885: Destroyed (no date given).

Osan) ee Transferred to the Office of SIGINT Operations
DS&T) .

au PWH

These were the only Records Retirement Requests in the
possession of OTC that are in the time frame relevant to the
JFK assassination. As their descriptions indicate, they do
not appear relevant to the request.

The DS&T also conducted a search of CITO records. This
DS&T office inherited some files from OTC when CITO was
established. We searched its records in the event some
Division D records were held by CITO. These searches
identified no responsive records.

Searches of OTS, OTC, and CITO records used the following
keywords:

surveil*
Russian
USSR
Cuba*
audio*
electron*
embassy
Mexico*
14-00000

CIA-IR-16 U-2 Files. The DS&T provided the Board a copy
of the U-2 shelflist. We also searched for records filed
under Richard Bissell’‘s name. We received no follow-on
request from the Board.

CIA-IR-16 FBIS-USR-92-112. The DS&T provided to the
Board a translation of articles about a KGB file on Oswald.

CIA-IR-17 DS&T Records on Castro Assassination Plots.
Records of the ODDS&T, OTC, and OTS were searched for the
following keywords: Castro, Oswalt, Oswald, assas*, and
KDBADGER. In addition, we searched OTS records on the
following: Project ZRRIFLE, Mollusca, Cubela, Black Leaf,
ballpoint pen, hypodermic syringe, Artime, silencer, gambling,
aerosol, cigar, depilatory, wiretapping, Phyllis McGuire, skin
diving suit, sea shell, and project AMLASH. As a result of
these searches, we provided to the Board a document titled,
“Handwriting Analysis - AMLASH-1,” dated 7 April 1965.

CIA-IR-25 Zapruder Film. A search was conducted on
records of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (records of
the former National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC)
and Office of Imagery Analysis) using the terms Zapruder, JFK,
Commission, and 1963. Hits on year 1963 did not reveal any
pertinent information. We located no record of a “William
Green” at NPIC in November 1963. We located no log books or
indexes regarding the processing or handling of any
assassination films. We also reviewed an audiotaped
interview with a former NPIC employee, and made minimal
deletions to the tape.

CIA-IR-33 Search of FBIS records for any files on Oswald,
and request for information on how FBIS-USR92-112 was filed.
No past or present files were found. An explanation on how
FBIS-USR-92-112 was filed was provided.

Review of three Ford Library Documents (178-10003-10453,
178-10004-10087, 178-10002-10394. Made deletions and deferred
to the DO on 178-10002-10394. Made deletions to Summary
Report on CIA Investigation of MKNAOMI.

Review of two terms. The DS&T advised that the terms
should not be released because of ongoing CIA activity at the
location.

Review of Alias Documentation issue (104-10220-10179, -
10181, and -10188). Requested that Board postpone release of
specific information. A search of OTS records indicated OTS
had no records on particular documents in the 1960s and 1970s.

Review of a slug in current use. Requested that the
Board postpone its release because the slug is in current use.
14-00000

Review of Organizational Charts of all Agency
directorates for the years 1958-1968 (CIA-1). Requested
deletions.

Review of the proposed release of an Agency facility.
Provided information about DS&T activities at risk if this
facility were acknowledged.

Review of records regarding the release of the name of
Jose Marie Mankel. Provided information about the potential
chilling effect on current operations.

Review of documents concerning a certain entity in the
CIA Sequestered Collection which are Not Believed Relevant
(NBR)to the JFK assassination. Four documents had been
previously released (one was released in full, and three were
sanitized); eight documents had been denied in full. The
Board determined that four documents were NBR.

Review of the Board’s request to review an index
resulting from the CIA’s History Staff‘s review of 61
histories for any connection to the JFK assassination. The
DS&T concurred in the Board’s review of the index.

4. (U) Based on this information, I have concluded that the

DS&T has diligently searched and reviewed all requests for
information from the Board that the DS&T has received.

5. (U) I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing

is true and correct.

Executed in Langley, Virginia on this 21" day of August 1998.

JFK Declaration of FREDRICK C. WICKHAM, JR.

I, Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. declare and say as follows:

1. (U) I am the JFK Focal point Officer (“FPO”) for
the Directorate of Operations (“DO”) of the United States
Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”). I have held technical
positions associated with the design and implementation of
computer systems, information management positions including
the DO IMO, and currently manage the DO information review
and release programs. I have been with the CIA since 1967
and have been associated with the JFK records review
activity since 1992 and the JFK FPO since 1995.

2. (U) I have obtained the information contained in
this declaration based upon my personal knowledge and
experience, as well as conversations with the DO Information
Review Officer, the DO Information Management Officer and
individuals taking action on the specific requests.

3. (U) DO records were predominately paper with a
hard copy card index in the 1960’s and an electronic index
in the 1970’s. The indices were based upon names that meet
specific collection requirements or projects that were
undertaken in the performance of our mission. Searches that
exceeded the capability of the indices required manual paper
file searches. I am aware that the DO searched the central
record system, which includes retired records, and hand

‘searched the convenience files and specialized files located

within various offices. Specialized collections are often
extremely sensitive and therefore only reside within the
components. During our newer searches we have not found any
significant documents in the DO files dated 1978 or prior
that appear to have been missed by the searches through
1978. We did locate one set of tapes which we know was made

‘available to the Warren Commission but was not included in

the HSCA sequestered collection. . We also found one file
that was only partially included in the HSCA sequestered
collection.

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

4. (S) Many of the searches performed today are not
significantly different than the ones done during the period
of the various commissions and committees. The searches
performed since 1995 still use the index to the central
record system the same as in 1978 but we have a couple of
new databases that were not available in 1978. We now
capture all cable traffic electronically and are able to
perform text searches of that repository. That repository
post-dates the HSCA so it is not useful in locating older
records. Additionally, we have converted a small amount of
very sensitive paper files into computer searchable form.
While these specific collections are part of the DO’s record
system, they were not electronically searchable nor were
they included within the indices to the DO’s central records
system. We have searched all of these records systems for
information responsive to requests the DO has received.

Some of the specific requests could not be satisfied by the
electronic searches and we resorted to manual paper searches
in an effort to locate the information.

5.  (U) The DO provided several briefings to the
Assassination Records Review Board and their staff, starting
in 1995, to describe the records created by the DO and the
record system that manages that information. We also
described what is meant by the need to continue protection
of sources and methods, and the impacts the revelation of ©
information would have on the lives of individuals and
current operations. The presenters included the Agency’s
General Counsel, Deputy Director for Operations, Chief of
the Information Management Staff, and several other DO
managers associated with the conduct of operations and
protection of sources and methods. We also provided |
detailed descriptions of current operations. We provided
information about specific individuals whose lives or
livelihood would be threatened as examples of harm that
would occur if certain information was released.
Additionally, we presented a description of the operational
environment that existed and the intensity under which
searches were performed in the wake of the assassination.

6. (U) The CIA issued an Agency-wide employee
bulletin for a new search for JFK Assassination records (OIM
98-0081, dated 30 July 1998). As requested by the ARRB, the
DO distributed the employee bulletin via Lotus Notes on 17

August and placed it on the morning message that people
receive when they first log onto the system.

7. (U) We have received numerous specific requests for
additional information. Based on personal knowledge and on
information reflected in our records, I am aware of the
following efforts that were conducted in responding to
specific ARRB requests for DO records. I have abbreviated
the questions to save space:

CIA-1 - Information on the organization of CIA

(U) The March 1995 ARRB request called for the
availability of “comprehensive organizational charts
(or the best available substitutes) .” The request
contained about three pages of various requirements,
including:

A. organizational charts of the Directorate of Plans

(DDP); “CIA Stations . . . in Mexico City (1960-68
only), Miami, other stations that we will discuss
orally;” any other offices . .. any pro~Castro groups,

or anti-Castro groups;

B. names and affiliations of all CIA personnel
responsible for liaison with the Warren Commission, the
House Select Committee on Assassinations, .. .;

C. all manuals, handbooks, .. . guides explaining: .
organizational structure, .. . filing systems, . .
for drafting memoranda;

D. copies of the instructions, guidelines, and other
materials used by your reviewers;

(U) Over a thousand pages of material were
provided in responding to this request.

(U) In May 1997 the ARRB further requested that 35
pages from CSN 5-50, 2 pages of the JMWAVE chart, and
14-00000

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

13 pages from Regulation No. 1-130 and HR #1 be
reviewed for release.

(U) Although the AARB staff had access to all of
the requested material, in January 1998 the Agency
answered that the various CSN 5-50 pages contained
basic information regarding the mission and functions
of the Office of Operations (now the Directorate of
Operations (DO)) and could not be released. However, in
April 1998, we agreed to provide structure charts for
the DDP in 1961 and 1963, with Division and Staff
titles and a JMWAVE Chart.

CIA-2 -— Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U) The ARRB request was dated May 1995 and was
six pages of file code numbers, crypts, names, dispatch
designators, and cable location designators and
requested identification thereof. A variety of methods
of responses was utilized, (some dated June and July
1995 and some undated) to answer, including a paired
listing (returned to CIA) microfilm file summary
sheets, and descriptive sheets.

CIA-3 - Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U) This ARRB request was dated June 1995 and was
three more pages of queries similar to CIA-2. A
variety of methods of responses was utilized, (some
dated June 1995 and some undated) to answer, including
a paired listing marked (returned to CIA), microfilm
file summary sheets, and handwritten notes.

CIA-4 -- Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U) This four-page ARRB request dated June 1995
was for “descriptions of each crypt, a brief
identification of each individual . .., and
indications of whether these crypts, operations, and
14-0000

o-

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

individuals are presently active or inactive.” This
request was answered orally and by informal notes.

CIA-5 -- Queries About Some Information

(U) This ARRB request was dated July 1995 and was
for identification of some twelve crypts, names, file
codes, or acronyms. This was answered by a paired
listing dated July 1995 (Returned to CIA).

CIA-6 -- Request for Systematic Review of Traffic

(U) This request was dated September 1995 and was
for “the CIA to assemble all of the cable traffic and
dispatches for .. . September 26, 1963 through October
20, 1963 and November 22, 1963 through December 30,
1963 between” . . . Mexico City and Headquarters and
Mexico City and JMWAVE. :

(C) The DO provided a classified response in
January 1998. All cable traffic and dispatches for the
period September 26, 1963 through October 20, 1963 and
November 22, 1963 through December 30, 1963 between:

(a) the Mexico city Station and Headquarters, and (B)
the Mexico City Station and JMWAVE are not available as
a chronological collection. The Office of
Communications (OC) only held cables long enough to
ensure that they were successfully transmitted to the
recipient. Because processes and resources to perform
cleanup activity varies, cables were sometimes held for
longer periods but not with the intention of becoming a
long-term reference collection. The offices of record
for the origination of cable traffic and dispatches did
not create files in this manner. The desks maintained
a temporary paper cable chrono. These were not usually
retained for more than 90 days. There is no electronic
repository for cables and dispatches from the stations.
Cables were printed out and went into specific files
dealing with subjects or operations. Accordingly, it
is not possible to recreate as a collection all of the
requested cables and dispatches.

CIA - 7 - Review of CIA Histories

(S) ARRB staffers Jeremy Gunn and Michelle Combs
have reviewed all of the requested histories except one
still under pre-review by the component because of
sensitive information -- we expect this to be resolved
in the near future. They were granted access to
identify any relevance to the assassination of
President Kennedy. They selected a number of pages to
be included within the materials to be declassified and
released to the National Archives. The histories
reviewed were as follows:

Record of Paramilitary Action Against the Castro
Government of Cuba, written by Colonel J. Hawkins,
USMC, on 5 May 1961, and controlled by WH division.

© Domestic Operations Base, written by Perry E.
Crookham, in May 1967, and controlled by so

CIA-10 -- Interagency Source Register

(U) This request was dated June 1996. The DO

provided a classified response to the ARRB together

11

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

with a copy of DOI 50-46, “The Interagency Source
Register,” and advised that an unclassified response
was not possible.

CIA-11 -- Sylvia Duran Materials

(U) This request was dated May 1996 and was “in
particular .. . [for] a ‘ten-page statement’ she may
have given to the Mexican police.” IMS/ESG “searched
its main index system, its ‘names’ data base, and hard
copy files.” The Agency response, dated October 1997,
indicated to the ARRB that “no such ‘statement’ has
ever been found and we cannot confirm that it ever
existed.”

CIA-12 -- Files on five persons allegedly connected
with JMWAVE

(U) This ARRB request was dated May 1996 for “all
201 files, personnel files, Office of Security files,
P-files, or any other files related to .. David Sanchez
Morales .. Ted Shackley .. Ron Cross .. Bart Henry and
Doug Gupton.

(U) The DO maintains no files on former employees,
such as Morales, Shackley, or Gupton (P).

(U) In a response dated August 1998, the DO
responded to DA/OIM/HRP/JFK that we were unable to
identify Ron Cross and Bart Henry as true names,
registered aliases, or pseudonyms and, therefore, could
not provide any files.

CIA - 13 - Mexico City Back-channel Communications

(U) The DO provided a classified response
explaining that these types of communications are
usually administrative matters, e.g., they contain
sensitive personnel information and they are not placed
in operational files or saved, collectively, in other

12
SECRET
14-0000

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

databases. Unfortunately, there is no way of
retrieving these cables through a reasonable search
using any generic or specific term, since cables were
not captured by any organized filing process.

CIA - 14 - Mexico City Station Annual Reports

(U) The DO was asked for specific annual reports from
Mexico City.

(S) We informed the ARRB that we were successful in
locating an official DO file which contained station
"annual reports" for the years 1957 through 1973. The
file included two dispatches which forwarded the RMDs
from Mexico Station for the years 1960 and 1961.
However, the RMDs, which were sent as separate
attachments (sent in a different pouch from the
covering dispatch memorandum) were not present in the
file. (NOTE: Attachments which contained true names
of CIA officers or assets or information that would
identify operational sources with CIA were customarily
sent in separate transmissions as a security measure if
a pouch(es) were compromised). We also note that in
a speed letter, dated 1978, written by DDO/LA/STB to
OLC, that the RMDs for Mexico City Station, for the
years, 1962, 1963, or 1964 could not be located.

(S) Based upon further review, we are providing an
updated response to the ARRB as follow: The only
report that was annually required of a station was that
relating to its ability to meet its mission directives,
now called "operational directives". These annual
reports called the Station's "Relative Mission
Directives" (RMD) were used to compose an overall
annual division or staff submission to the Deputy
Director for Operations, as an evaluative tool. The
RMDs, themselves are a summary of station activities
reported to Headquarters in other correspondence during
the course of the year, were used to compile a division
level evaluation--in a sense, an annual report card-~on
how it was doing against operational requirements. The
station reporting was extracted into the larger

13

sscoer
14-00000

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

division summary, much as it is today. The RMDs from
year-to-year could and often did change with the
operational requirements the Agency was expected to
fulfill. As such, the RMDs for each station had value
only as data to the larger examination of how the
Agency performed its intelligence mission in a given
year and what trends or changes this review would
suggest for the ensuing year.

(U) Station reporting of the type described above
would be treated as transitory information and as such
meet the definition of a temporary record. It is
entirely possible and quite probable that these
facilitative reports were systematically destroyed.

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
authorized the Agency to destroy facilitative reports
in 1954 (NARA Reference: II-NNA-1057); the destruction
of intelligence, collection requirement files in 1962
(NARA Reference: NN-163-1), and operational management
objective files at the subcomponent level (which would
include reports from, Stations and base) in 1977 (NARA
Reference: NC1—-263-77-10). The 1977 authorization
remains in force today.

CIA - 15 - Win Scott files from Russ Holmes files

; (U) The Retired Record Table RRT shows
Mr. Scott’s Mexico City files were retired as Job 78-
00594R on 11 August 1972. These records were retired
to the Agency’s Archives and Records Center under Item
Number 40-76 in the Records Control Schedule in effect
at the time. Files under Item Number 40-76 were
described as:

“Temporary. Destroy on completion of specific job
or as they serve their purpose. Return folders and
documents on loan and destroy remaining papers.”

The RRT shows Job 78-00594R was destroyed on 12
January 1987.

The RRT page showing the disposition of Mr.
Scott’s files and the page of the Records Control
Schedule which describes Item Number 40-76 have been

incorporated in the Agency’s JFK collection and will be
processed for release to NARA.

CIA - 16 - Oswald Pre-Assassination Files

(S) The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO
records to determine if there were any additional files
containing pre-assassination records relating to
Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald
201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The
document identified CI Staff as the file custodian.

CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were
incorporated into the 201.

(S) Prior to establishing a 201, any documents
received would have been placed in an operational
interest file. We found no reference to the existence
of an operational interest file. If such a file had
existed, however, it might not have been registered in
the central index. It was standard procedure that
upon opening a 201, the documents from an operational
interest file would be transferred to the 201.

(S) Given that Oswald was a subject of the
HTLINGUAL operation, it is reasonable to believe that
there was a file on him. We destroyed all of the
HTLINGUAL files under court order, and no record was
made of what files existed. We did not review all of
the DO record system to destroy all copies of material
which may have been derived from HTLINGUAL material.
We know, for instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items
related to Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection.

(S) In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the
information we are aware of that we had prior to the
assassination. ,

CIA-IR-01 - Personnel Assigned to Post from 1959-1964

(S) The request for a listing of personnel
assigned to Moscow 1959-1964 was discussed with Board

15
~SEGREL.

“SESREL_

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

Staff. Instead of a listing, the files on individuals
who were assigned to Moscow and a history of the Moscow
Station were made available. In addition, the staff
interviewed a former COS Moscow. The Board staff is
satisfied with the response and will prepare its own
documentation.

CIA-IR-03 - Full Computer Search for List of HTLINGUAL
Files

(C) First, as an outcome of the Pike and Church
Committees investigations, all HTLINGUAL files which
were identifiable, as such, were destroyed under court
order. Copies of materials from these files that may
have been made prior to the destruction order and put
into other files have, however, surfaced as files are
reviewed. This includes material in the HSCA
sequestered collection.

(C) The DO ran a search on the term “HTLINGUAL. ”
Some records were identified as destroyed. Some were
not so marked but are not locatable under the job
number identified; however, given that there is no
requirement to record destroyed records under the
Federal statutes for disposition programs and given
limited resources for noting files destroyed, this is
not uncommon. The HTLINGUAL search further identified
files because they had been the subject of Freedom of
Information Act queries; however, these were not
HTLINGUAL files per se, but files which contained the
FOIA requester queries for HTLINGUAL information.

(U) ARRB staff member Michelle Combs has reviewed
the HTLINGUAL file run and has selected some folders
for review. OIM has identified that they have only
redacted records for the large FOIA case that is
listed. IMS/ESG/HCS is retrieving its records for
unredacted copies of the records and will make them
available.

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(U) The DO provided the following unclassified
response about the Angleton Files: The files that
Kalaris mentioned in Mangold’s book were incorporated
with the files of the CI staff. Per memorandum dated
1976-1979, the CI files were reviewed and incorporated
into the DO record system. Items that were duplicates
or not worthy of retention were destroyed. The memos
describe the file collection and the process that was
followed. Because the files that were once known as
Angleton’ s have been dispersed within the DO records,
they are no longer identifiable as a collection.

CIA-IR-06 -- QKENCHANT

(U) IMS/ESG/HCS initially provided a classified
response to DA/OIM/JFK for this request in February
1998. In a follow-up response for declassification of
the response, IMS/ESG/HCS worked with the providing
office and then approved DA/OIM/JFK’s unclassified
response.

CIA-IR-07 ~- Claude Barnes Capehart

(U) The DO provided a classified response, which
stated that we found no record when conducting a name
trace for records on Capehart. Subsequently, we were
advised by the CIA’s Project Manager, Mr. J. Barry
Harrelson, that this request was primarily being
researched by the Directorate for Science & Technology.

CIA-IR-09 -- George Bush

(S) The ARRB requested information about George
Bush because of a reference to “George Bush of the
Central Intelligence Agency” in a certain FBI document
dated November 1963.

17
14-00000

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(S) IMS/FAB provided a main index search response
to IMS/ESG/HCS. A 201 (that dated back only to 1977)
and a DCD file were located.

(U) DA/OIM/JFK responded to the ARRB in February
1998 that the “search determined the Agency has no
record of any association with George Herbert Walker
Bush during the 1963 time period.”

CIA-IR-11 - Warren Commission critics (Does CIA
maintain files or records on specified critics - other
than press clippings?)

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response for
“any files or records on Warren Commission critics
Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Harold
Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher below. In addition to
these records, our research did surface a reference to
a file titled “Garrison Investigation of Kennedy
Assassination” which was opened in 1969 and closed in
1996. At the direction of the ARRB staff, no material
in response to FOIA requests or news clippings in
Public Affairs was included.

A. Edward J. EPSTEIN - The DO has no identifiable
information on subject. Our search did surface the
name Edward Epstein; however, by using additional
biographic data known about subject, we were able to
dismiss this name as a false “hit.”

B. Josiah THOMPSON - Subject was of operational
interest to the DO circa 1962; therefore, a 201 file
does exist on this individual. ARRB staff member Combs
reviewed this file in August 1998.

C. Mark LANE - Our search produced references to two
documents: (1) An Agency dispatch from Germany dated
23 January 1970, and (2) An OGC letter dated 29 March
1977. Both of these documents are available for
review. The OGC letter concerns a 1976 FOIA request --
Mark Lane was one of the individuals requesting the
FOIA action -- which involves two dispatches dated 1967

18
SECRET-
14-00000

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

and 1968. Because these two documents are the subject
of a FOIA request, they are not included in this
response.

D. Harold Weisberg - There is a 201 file on subject
which contains very limited information. This file can
be made available for review by an ARRB staff member.
The DO retired records system, CARD, has a reference to
an Agency dispatch (EGBA-87605, 1969) which indicates
subject was in correspondence with Julius Mader. This
document was in the files when it was reviewed by staff
member Combs in August 1998.

E. Sylvia Meagher - We found no DO information.

CIA — IR-12 - Contacts with journalists or publishing
houses

(U) The DO provided both an unclassified and
classified response about contacts with journalists or
publishing houses, regarding whether CIA might have
attempted to influence any journalists or publishers
regarding public discussion of the assassination.
Searches with generic terms such as “journalists,”
“publishers,” “publishing houses,” and “media” would
not produce meaningful responses. This question
required the research of crypts mentioned in various
documents in the JFK “assassination records.” These
crypts referred to projects managed under the overall
guidance of a staff in the DO and in all instances were
projects concerning press and propaganda programs
designed to promote anti-communism and to counter
Soviet press and propaganda initiatives worldwide.
Specifically, the various projects were developed for
the following reasons (Corresponding cryptonyms to
these projects were provided in a classified document,
and are not included below):

A. to counter-Soviet activities in international

intellectual organizations, in order to unite and
promote anti-Communist intellectuals.

E. to purchase and mail books to selected addressees

F. to cover a worldwide news and feature story
service.

G. as a’ Press and Propaganda Developmental and Target
of Opportunity project involving Latin America.

CIA-IR-13 -- Organized Crime

(S) As part of DA/OIM/JFK’s research, IMS/ESG/HCS
was requested to do a trace on “Charles Ford.” The
trace resulted in no hits.

(S) Later, to answer CIA-IR-03 on HTLINGUAL
material, a computer run was made. The list contained
a citation to testimony to Congress by Charles Ford in
September of 1975. A copy of Ford’s testimony to a
Senate Committee regarding a Mafia connection to
assassination plots against Castro was provided to
DA/OIM/JFK in February 1998.

(U) At the request of HRP JFK, several project
Crypts were searched and results provided in connection
with this request.

CIA - IR-15 - Mexico City Station electronic
surveillance and surveillance tapes

(S) The Directorate of Operations has checked
Headquarters records for files referenced in HMMW 12454

20.
SECRET.
14-00000

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

and for files on the crypts cited in this document and
searched for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches
cited in this document. As previously explained, the
crypts in HMMW 12454 have been researched. The dispatch
was apparently written in haste and in truncated
language without correct knowledge of the operational
crypts for the specific operations in Mexico City. The
crypts in the dispatch are the more generic crypts for
teltap operations, not for the then-current operations
in Mexico City, which are in question.

(U) There has been considerable interest over the .
years in locating any electronic surveillance tapes
that would have been made during the period that Oswald
visited Mexico (26 September - 2 October 1963). A
thorough search has been conducted of the DO’s record
system as well as the index to retired records in an
attempt to locate any tapes and/or find documentation -
to resolve their disposition. We have discussed this
issue with operational experts and their professional
opinion is that most likely tapes such as these were
never returned to Headquarters for retention. It was
normal practice to recycle audio tapes after they had
been listened to by transcribers and their transcripts
made. :

(U) Messages between field stations and
headquarters used operational jargon and shortened
sentence structures that can sometimes allow for
misinterpretations. Thus, possible confusion was
created when references to what was being sent to
headquarters referred to “tapes” but really intend
“information” from tapes.

(U) In our search efforts we did locate
approximately 185 audio surveillance tapes of the Cuban
and Soviet embassies in Mexico City that were recorded
during the immediate time following the assassination
(22 November 1963 to January 1964). The fact that
these tapes were retained and returned to Headquarters
could account for the fact that some people recall that
some tapes existed which were sent to Headquarters.

21
14-0000

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(U) Based upon the search efforts that were
undertaken and the opinions of operational experts
consulted, CIA has concluded that the tapes in question
do not exist and were almost certainly recycled in the
normal course of business before their potential value
was identified.

CIA-IR-18 - Information on one DO Office

(S) The DO provided an unclassified response on
the “Defector Staff” listed in CSN 5-50 revised in
October 1959 and the “CIA Defector Coordinator,
DDP/CDC,” revised in October 1963. The “Deféctor and
Contract Personnel Branch” had the symbol SR/OS/D.

Only Soviet Bloc (formerly Warsaw Pact countries)
defector cases were handled by this branch. Staffs and
branches identified, among other duties, were
responsible for identifying, debriefing, and resettling
foreign defectors of intelligence interest.

CIA - IR-19 - Computer search on specific individuals

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response to
the ARRB Staffs’ request to review Agency files on some
38 names who were the subjects of the HSCA. All files

(U) This request involved “Howard” and some
extensive research for the name as a true name, pseudo,
or alias for anyone out of JMWAVE and/or connected to
the DRE operation.

(U) We also did extensive research for DRE monthly
reports. In the JFK collection, there was a gap in the
reporting between December 1962 and April 1964.

(U) This also covered the question of George
Joannides’ Performance Appraisal Reports and their
inclusion in the collection with some redactions.

(S) A name trace was run. The resultant
information was included in an IMS/ESG/HCS
“clarification memo” for the ARRB. The text, which was
classified “Secret,” reads as follows:

“Oswald LeWinter is a naturalized US citizen and
aman of at least four other names -- George
Mearah, Oscar LeWinter, Razin LeWinter, and
Ibrahimin Razin. Although he appeared in the
East German Who’s Who in CIA, the CIA has never
had any official affiliation with LeWinter.
LeWinter was the subject of an Agency “burn
notice” in 1990; a burn notice alerts the
intelligence community. In this case, the alert
advised that LeWinter was an intelligence
swindler, peddler, and fabricator. (C)

CIA has a report of an episode involving an
intelligence fabricator and convicted drug
dealer Oswald LeWinter, AKA George Mearah, born
2 April 1931, in Vienna, Austria. In July 1990,
a CIA representative overseas reported that
LeWinter, using the name of George Mearah,
contacted him and offered to put high-level GDR
officials wishing to defect in touch with our
representative and in turn the CIA. This
contact would be in exchange for help and a
presidential pardon that would wipe the slate
clean and leave LeWinter (Mearah) without a
record as a convicted felon. LeWinter (Mearah)
claimed this was important [because] he was
married (for the third time) and starting a new
life; he was reportedly considering quietly
acquiring Israeli citizenship. This contact was
not followed up because of the “burn notice.”

CIA-IR-30 -- Cherepanov Papers

IMS/ESG/HCS located a workbook copy in English and
provided access to ARRB staffer Michelle Combs. She
was further offered access to the original Russian
copies. Combs then wrote a memorandum dated April 1997
that identified the collection as papers that ;

\ “primarily examine the habits, potential vulnerabil-
ities, and KGB approaches made to various members of
the American Embassy staff.” Combs went on to say that
“no information of believed relevance to the assassin-
ation of President John F. Kennedy was found in these

CIA-IR-32 -- AMWORLD

(C) The confidential draft of the IMS/ESG/HCS

as a definition of the purpose of the AMWORLD
operation. The AMWORLD operation was a covert
Agency effort to provide support to several
Cuban exile groups. This was an “autonomous”
operation designed to bring the exile groups
under the direct control of Manuel Artime
Buesa. AMWORLD’s mission was to cause a popular
uprising in Cuba through the use of propaganda
and paramilitary forces to ultimately overthrow
Fidel Castro.

personnel; he obtained sites for training and
deployment, and he had primary responsible for
day-to-day operations. AMWORLD was based in
three locations. The AMWORLD propaganda
efforts were based in Costa Rico. The
paramilitary efforts were run out of the
Nicaragua base. The third base was located in
Miami to service AMWORLD requirements including
the collection of operational leads, servicing
of dead drops and assisting in the vetting of
AMWORLD personnel.”

(C) Combs asked two follow up questions: Was part
of the program to put in place a government in exile?
Was there ever a government in exile? IMS/ESG/HCS put
these questions to LA and DO/IRO. The DO/IRO has :
provided the following additional write up, classified
confidential: ,

““(C) Based on file reviews and recollections
from officers involved in the Cuban program,
‘there was never a Cuban Government in Exile.
During the planning for the Bay of Pigs
operation it was envisioned that after the
invasion site had been secured, Miro Cardona and
the Cuban Revolutionary Council would be flown
to the area to establish a new Cuban Government.
The invasion site.was never secured.

(C) The AMWORLD Project, begun well after the
failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion and after
the release of Manuel Artime Buesa and other Bay
of Pigs veterans from Cuban prisons, was
designed to support and unite several Cuban
exile groups under the control of Artime in an
effort to enhance the cohesion of the exiles and
augment Artime's capability to launch propaganda
and paramilitary attacks against the Cuban
mainland. The overall mission of AMWORLD was to
foment a popular uprising in Cuba which could

‘ lead to the ultimate overthrow of Fidel Castro.
There is no evidence that AMWORLD's mission even
remotely came close to fruition and no evidence
that a projected government in exile was ever
considered as a viable option.''

CIA-IR-34 -- Files of CIA officials/offices

(U) IMS/ESG/HCS ran a computer search for ‘OPI 40”
files. This computer run was then made available to
ARRB staff member Michelle Combs for review. Her
review encompasses some 42 boxes from a variety of
retired DDP files. The identified folders were gathered
in an aggregate of seven boxes (including one that is
exclusively microfilm and microfiche of so-called
Registry logs).

(U) The ARRB staff member’s review is about half
completed. She has so far selected some 44 records
totaling 123 pages to be included in the JFK
collection. When the ARRB staff member’s review is
completed, the selected records will be copied and
subjected first to a duplicate check by DA/OIM/JFK
reviewers, then reviewed by those reviewers, then
reviewed by HCS reviewers.

(U) We have been unable to locate any “operational
diaries” by William Harvey.

CIA-IR-35 -— Oswald related Information

- (S) The surfacing of a report in the continuing
Oswald 201 file attributed to IJDECANTER prompted the
ARRB to request a review of that defector’s 201 file.
Certain such reporting records will be included in the
JFK collection as records in Oswald’s 201. A Board
request for an updated search of records for Oswald
related material generated some 128 hits, which were
reviewed by Ms. Michelle Combs of the ARRB staff.

Three records, selected by Ms. Combs and sanitized with
her concurrence, were selected for inclusion in the JFK
assassination records collection.

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response to
the ARRB staff’s request for a brief explanation of how
the Directorate of Operations processed cables in the
1963/1964 timeframe. We are unable to locate any
Agency-wide definitive records on the subject for this
time frame, and the information provided below is based
solely on the memory of DO officers familiar with
procedures in place at the time and in the specific
offices in which they served.

(U) Each area division in the DO maintained and
staffed its own registry. Although each registry was
configured to meet each division’s unique requirements,
there were common functions performed by all the
registries to include: collecting, sorting, and
delivering of incoming cables; maintenance of incoming
and outgoing cable “chronos;” collecting and delivering
of incoming and outgoing pouch material; and the
issuance and maintenance of “pseudo and alias” card
files.

(U) On a daily basis, usually six days per week,
each registry collected its incoming cable traffic from
a central processing point, then called the Cable
Secretariat, within the Office of Communications. The
incoming cables were then sorted by registry personnel
according to predefined guidelines. These guidelines
were unique to each division and were frequently
altered to meet changing operational requirements.
Sorted cables were then delivered to specific
operational/area desks. A “chrono” copy of each
incoming cable was maintained, on a temporary basis,
usually for 90 days, and the receiving office placed a
copy into an operational file based upon subject or
activity.

(U) Outgoing cables were created and coordinated
by appropriate operational/area desks and usually
released by the chief of the division or a designated
releasing officer. “Released” cables were then hand
delivered or sent by pneumatic tube system (a system
long ago dismantled from the original Headquarters
building) to Cable Secretariat for processing into the
Agency’s communication network. “Chrono” copies of

outgoing cables were forwarded to the registry for a 90
day hold and the sending office placed a copy in the
appropriate operational file.

{U) There was a centralized processing section for
the directorate that received copies of the cables to
review them and update the central index cards.

CIA-IR-37 - William Pawley

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response to
the ARRB’s request to review all files on William
Pawley and any files on his possible connection with
Cuban exile groups in the 1962-1963 time frame. The
Agency’s 201 file on Pawley consists of three volumes,
the same as in the JFK sequestered collection, and
November 1962 is the date of the last record indexed to
his 201. However, the Agency holds. operational files
for the period 1963 to 1965 which related to Pawley.
Those files were made available for review by the ARRB
staff and they selected a number of documents for
inclusion in the materials being processed for release
to NARA. :

Unnumbered Request -- Worldwide Query

(U) In March 1998 the ARRB asked “whether a
worldwide query was sent out the day after the
assassination for all case officers to query their
sources for any information on the assassination and
Oswald. Are or would all the answers be in the
collection?”

(S) The following information has been identified:

A. A “book message,” that is a message to all stations
and bases, DIR 84608, dated 22 November 1963 (date/time
group 2220542) was sent. This message advised all
stations and bases about the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. The message advised all to be “on
alert.” This cable is found in Oswald’s 201 file, Box
1, Volume 3.

B. A “book cable,” DIR 85133, dated 26 Nov. 1963
(date/time group 262319Z) was sent. This message was
sent “routine” but with ten addressees on a “prior-ity
basis.” The ten “priority” addressees were: Paris,

' Rome, Madrid, Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, Brussels, The

Hague, London, and Ottawa. This cable advised all

- stations and bases of the identity of the alleged

assassin by name of Lee Harvey Oswald. This cable can
be found in Oswald’s 201 file, Box 1, Volume 4.

C. Neither of these two cables indicates that a
“routing” coding was to be used to ensure that all
responses, if any, would be classified to Oswald’s 201
file.
