ga that Osvaldo RELOVA Pénicitet, born on 13 August. 1930, was

Diplomatic passport D/G3/415 with Mexican visa number QF-7090; he
had no Canadian visa. The address on his passport was given as

of the Consolidated Hardware Stores and annexes. fu late
1961 he went to sce source to get help with an investigation
on a Mr. BARRAL, Administrator of the Consolidated (sic).
RELOBA was requesting source's aid in the belief that source
