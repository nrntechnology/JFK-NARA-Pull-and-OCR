MEMORANDUM POR THE RECORD |
i

@. The primary reason for again meeting AMLASH~1

“ before hie planned return to Cuba was to brief him on the ro

i security implications Anvolved in the infiltration and j

4 possible capture of Modesto Orlando Orozeo Basulto AKA t

: Bebo Orozco, who infiltrated into cuba on 21 Dec 1964, ‘4
Orozco, according to his ‘fe, went to Cuba to rescue Jose i
Vasquez .Horey and three others who were hiding in the. of

, home of a woman named Gloria Cabrera, who lived at No. 72 Ly
27th Street, between N & O, Apartment 3, Vedado, Havana. xt
Orozco's capture, if he has been captured, presents an bs

a indirect threat to the security of AMLASH-1 and a more

ut direct threat to the security of AMTRUNK-10 since Orozeo

: in Jan 1964 exfiltrated through the rat line established

" by AMICE-14 (Miguelito), Upon his return to Cuba,

ca AMLASH-1 will check the above vith AMTRUNE-10; and, i¢

still in hiding, r¢ the letter to UNSHAFU-9 mentions a

~~ : good and pleasant return trip, this will mean that Orozco
is not under the control of the Security service. If the
letter talks aboutA long, tiring trip, this Will indicate
that Orozeo has been arrested. AMLASH-1 was also requested
to send a report on the above and any complications which
have developed or may develop from Orozco's infiltration.

president and that his man, Laghro Mora, would be one of

regarding the precautions being taken to prevent sabotage
of the lodkotives being shipped from France to Cuba;
eBpecifically, how carefully do they check the placement
of the seals, are they special seals or regular load
seris, are there going to be any additional checks once
the locomotives reach Cuba, will they drain the of11 and
lubricants from the factory to the port, and do they run
the locomotives under their own power or are they towed.
AMLASB~1 agreed to attempt to develop answers to the above
requirements and pass the information to his contact in
the Paris Station. AHMLASH-1 also agreed to attempt to find
out and pass to the Paris Station through UNSNAFU-9 the
names of the Cuban techs training at La Rochelle,

h. In a general discussion regarding the persons with
whom AHLASH-1 had been in contact either personally or
through letters, AMLASH-1 mentioned Alfredo Portela,
AHLASH-1 stated he had received a letter from Portela and
had in turn written to Portela. He considers Portela a
friend which was the only reason for writing to him.

5 i, AMLASH-1 was debriefed on Cuban Intelligence
Service personnel. A cable on this subject was sent fron
Paris to Headquarters.

lowing persons:

(3) Cadte, Raul Diaz Arguelles, Chief of
Artillery of the Oceidental army.

(4) Elpidio Baex Bigo. According to AMLASH-1,
Baez is a trusted Fidelman,

(5) Luis Manuel Cantillo Toirac, Assigned to
the Cuban Embassy in Madrid and one of the security
people, He was formerly assigned to Brazil, is young
and has for several years been with Pinero and the
Cuban IS,

(6) Enrique Oltuski Osacki. Oltuski is a close
friend of Faustino Perez and his stock sith the regine

(7) Sergio To1lfon. Code clerk in the Embassy in

Ambassador Carrillo,

1, Gastro enteritis, water pollution and unsanitary
conditions. AMLASH-1 states there are no real problems,
although the scarcity and lack of a balanced diet do
cause some problems. The purification of water has been

. & problem which probably has been the cause of some of the
sickness in the country. —_—

m. AMLASH-1 did not believe that Aragones had invited
him to fly back to Havana with him tn order to get him
back because of eny serious security matter. AMLASH-1
did state that Aragones was concerned that AMLASH-1 may not
return to Cuba. Since Aragones cleared AMLASH-1 for his
trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH~1 does
not defect and returns to Cuba. AMLASH~1 feels Aragones
does not want any problems with Fidel in case AMLASH-1
decides to stay out.

nm. AMLASH-1 was unable to provide any information on
the political developments in Cuba in mid-November and
December since he had been out of the country since early
November. AMLASH-1 was asked to check on the problems
between the opposing factions in the Cuban leadership and
explained the issues, the background and personalities
involved. -

o. Soviet advike or influence in political and economic |
matters creates ro ‘tment among the middle and higher level i

Caban officials. Basically, the Soviets are not respected.

H : p. Rank of Cuban officials under Fidel in teras of
I their influence in making national policy, Rseul is still
the heir apparent to Fidel. Next to Raul is Che Guevara,

After that, no other official, according to AMLASH-1, has
any great influence in the making of Cuban national policy,
President Dorticos’ relationghip with Fidel is gvod since
be is a hard and serious worker, has good administrative
ability and is able to work within the general outline laid
down by Fidel, Raul Castro has sone political influence |
and control in Oriente where he has placed his men in i
positions of influence, but only Fidel personally has any
poktical influence in the rest of Cuba, Even within the
military Fidel selects and appoints high army officers.
Che Guevara is still strong in the economic field and
has not suffered a decline in his influence and authority
because of his earlier policy of industrialization,
Guevara restricts himself to the economic field and plays
@ very small role in the political field. He is serious
and very hard worker, one of the few, according to AMLASH-1,
who has worked geven days a week without leave since the
revolution, Emilio Aragones holds an important pos{tion
as the organizational secretary of the PURS. He is the
official who was always at the office of the National
Directorate of the Party and has contact with all the
officials in the regime, He plays an important coordinating
role, Faure Chomon has been.accused of organizing former
13th of March Revolutionary Directorate people, but,

. according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that
Chomon always gives jobs in the ministry he heads to DR
people, Because of this Chomon today controls to 3 large
degree the Hinistry of Transportation. Of all the ainistries,
the DR's stronghold is in the Ministry of Transportation.
Other DR people who continue to hold important positions

“ in the regime are Alberto Kora, Ambassador Carrillo and
Jose Naranjo. a

q. AMLASH~1 and AMWHIP-1 were unable to develop any
specifics, but from their conversations with Ambassador
Carrillo got the impression that Carrillo would prefer and
_ Welcome a transfer from the Eabassy in Paris to the
-.- =... + Embassy.in Madrid,

- _¥. According to Emilio Aragones, Anibal Escalante
is being considered for a job outside Cuba. The job will
probably be in the commercial/economic field, but a
decision had not been made as of November 1964 as to
location. ,

S&. AMLASH-1 sgain reported that he feels Orlando i
Blanco, Consul of the Cuban Embassy in Bern, is :
approachable since he is unhappy with the Cuban regime,

| AMLASE-1 also feels that Enrique Rodriguez Loeches,

| Cuban Ambassador in Pabat, is approachable if approached :
and developed by the right person. Marina Garcia Gonzalez
assigned to the commercial section of the Cuban Embassy
in Rabat, AMLASH-1 feels is also approachable and feels
money can be used as an inducement. Ambassador Carrillo,
AHLASH-1 feelea, if the proper person developed him, could

robably be compromised with Fidel, He is a charact:
