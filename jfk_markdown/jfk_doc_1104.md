MEMORANDUM FOR ‘THE FILE

Yo * suBJECT: Board Meeting of December 27 - 26,

The Board convened at 9:(0 a.m, on December 27, * Those
present were Dr, Killian, Chairman, Board members Langer, Murphy,
Gray, Doolittle, Pace and Clifford and Messrs. Coyne and Ash,

Dr. Killian suggested thet Board members read the draft
report which had been furnished to the Board on the preceding
day by Mr. MeCone, the Directcr of Central Intelligence, setting :
forth the results of the all-source review which the Board had ‘
requested concerning U, S. intelligence community activities with
respect to the Soviet military buildup in Cuba during the 6-months
preceding Gctober 22, 1962, ‘The Chairman asked that Board members
make note of any comments and questions they might wish to raise
for discussion during this two-day meeting. Dr. Killian said that
he was not sure the DCI's repert had the approval of the intelll-
! genee community at this point, for he understood that Mr. MeCone
: was at that moment reviewing the draft report in Seattle, and it

- was possible that some of the conclusions and factual details
might not have yet received final approval by the agencies which
contributed to the preparatior of the report (CIA, DIA, State and
NS&). Accordingly, the Chaimran noted the importance or the
Giscussions which the Board would have on the following day witn
heads of the intelligence agercies., The Chairman also thought
that the Board should ajm for the preparation of a Board report
to the President at the close of this 2-day meeting.

Dr. Killian said that he had very recently talked to Mr,
McGeorge Bundy who hopes that the Board will take the time it needs
to produce a solid report on the handling given by U. S. -intelli-
gence agencies to the Soviet military bulldus in Cuba. Mr. Bundy
assured that the President will understand that the Board is going
into the subject deeply and otjectively, About 10 days ago, the
Chairman related, he had received a telephone call from Mr, Bundy
who said that he had seen an early draft of the DCI's report (from
a confidential source) and was concerned because the report did not
get to the basic issues, and Mr, Bundy expressed an intention to
talk to Mr. Mccone about this. Dr. Killian stated that he had an
appointment to see Mr, Bundy later in the morning at which time he
would ask Mr, Bundy to meet with the Board during the course of

this meeting. ; ; ;

his concern that our lack of information on such matters as these’, ;
indicates the absence of an adequate intelligence capability to -.’

Dr. Killian at. t . point r2ported to. the Board on’ the con-~

versation whieh he had¥just-had 11th Mr, ‘Bundy. ©. According to“
Mr, Bundy, the Presidentfis fully “aware that the Board is: con-

ducting its review of the Cuba situation...’ The President wants
an objective report ‘froma ‘group 'ofscitizens ‘who nave-no axe to
grind, and he is’ placing ‘great store on: this effort ofthe Board,
The Chairman said that Mr, Bundy was’ obviously concerned about © :
the prospect that the Congress will make inquiries ‘into the Cuba + Deeg
matter, However, Mr. Bundy feels there is a bare possibility that. ~ Wea’
Congressional investigators will be more he ant to raise hypo- os
thetical questions if they’ learn of the existence of a study having _ WW 3
been made by a group such as the Board, It is Mr. Bundy's hope
that the Board will cevefully coisider' the preparation of a sani-
tised version of the report, but if ‘the. Board end the President feel
that this cannot oe done’ then-the*Board should try to prepare ‘a
report which’could be. used in exacutive session of a Committee of
tne Congress. wet ee

Dr, Kiljian went on to report other matters which had been
covered in i discussion with . Bundy. He said tnat Mr. Bundy-
nad expres concern over the failure of the DCI to accept the
s estion that there be submi. doa move adequate report than the
one which the DCI forwarded to tae Board on December 26. Mr, Bundy
noted in this connection that the DCI's report assigns to policy °
makers prime responsibility for any failures witn respect to
intelligence handling. 7:0 7.

On- the question /o
purposes of the Board study, Mr. ‘Bundy informed the, Chairman »
that certainly the Board ‘should 3xamine such records and that

_ they_could be obtained, fr ‘Parrott (Mr, Bundy commented: that

As to the Board 's¥study', Mr ae “Dr, Killian tha
the Board snould includein its" review discussions with the
Secretaries of State ard Defense andthe Chairmen of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff -- Mr.’ Bundy ‘ind: cating that the Secretary of
Defense has particular reservations about ithe DCI's report,

Another matter mentioned by, Mir, Bundy was his belief that
the morale of the intelligence, community as a whole stands to
suffer in the aosence.of a carefully done review and report
whitch is being expected .from the Board, . wt

With regard to the interim seport which the Board has under. *

‘The Chairman asked? thei )DCI whether the MONGOOSE-achivity
presented any particular“intelligence problem in-the’ Cuba. ,
situation. Mr. MeCone’:said‘‘shat.it had not. He said-that. -
in the MONGOOSE activity’ the’ Special’ Group and the Attorney
General had given a great deul offconsideration to the need
for intelligence collection sith: respect to Cuba, but “che

than other purposes. Nevertheless, the MONGOOSE activity’
contributed to the over-all :ntelligence collection effort *

Mr. Murphy wondered why there had been a let-down in -
intelligence gathering after the Bay of Pigs incident, Mr.
MeCone said that this took place before his time, but he
assumed that the reasons had to do with discouragement and |" -’
other psychological fectors. In response to Dr. Killian's
question as to whether another intelligence let-down was in
store in the wake of the Cubs crisis, "Mr. McCone said that
there was in fact a great danger of such a development followin
what some officials consider was an “intelligence victory" it
for the United States. Mr.“lieCone, noting that the Soviet
SA-2's remain in Cuba,’ said le-had brought this up forcefully
a week ago at an NSC Executive Committee meeting, and:the. «
President had agreed to get 10rd to the USSR that any inter

considered as being most grave -- and Messrs. bieCloy. and

Mr, Pace asked whether Mr." McCone would favor the use of

Guantanamo Maval Base as a base “for launching intelligence .and

related operations against Cubi. Mr, McCone said that he would’...
not be in favor of this because if we were caught using Guantanamo

for intelligence operations Cas tro would obtain UN and other support - ey

for Cuba's demands for U,.S, evacuation of the Naval Base.

Answering General.Doolittle's question, the DCI stated that’ .

“ sulting in coverage of: all: targets once a week and in coverage of

... Me, -Murphy’ asked, the-DCIi'to ‘state’ the?meaning of, "MONGOOSE
~B PLUS", Mr, McCone explained”.shat in the MONGOOSE Group it
was originally conceived ‘that Piase I would be one of gathering
intelligence on the possibiliti2s for the organization and supply
of resistance groups within Cuba,‘ but this effort was ("only fairly,
"successful" because: Castro has. 3ome. 100,000" informers’ in place -‘in‘f,
Cuba and exercises 4nternal*sec arity controls through a sy
ration cards, and therefore, CI4 did not get as many teams’ into .
Cuba as had been hoped. On Augist 10, -Phase II was reached with
MONGOOSE planning: for, (a) .violeat actions (b) a relatively high

“ Veyel of actions, or. "B-PLUS",*and lesser act-ens, or ‘"B MINUS"

Mr, McCone said that he?had not: been prepared to endorse propose’
"RB pLUS" actions in the absence of plans for military backing, ':\
because of his own speculation that the U.S. would be faced with.
MRBMs in Cuba. In any case, '.the MONGOOSE effort became diverted

With reference to the abserce of photographic evidence of Soviet
offensive missile deployment p2 ior to October 14 photography, Mr.
McCone said that if one looks <t photography of Cuba obtained on
September 5 it is possible.to, spot evidence of activity at the San
Cristobal MRBM site, but this <ctivity could have been that of
agricultural workers and the evidence did not then point to missile
activity. Dr. Killian noted tie Board's concern that Soviet cam-
ouflage operations may be deceiving us. Mr, MeCone expressed his
own great concern that the Soviets are deceiving us by camouflage
methods, Acknowledging that our intelligence estimates leave a
certain margin for error, Mr. HeCone noted that it is nevertheless
impossible for us to say that ye know all that is going on in the }

_USSR with respect to missile activity, In response to Dr, Killian's.~
comment that public discussion: ,seem.to indicate that U. S. missile
capabilities are superior.'to..those of. the USSR, the DCI considered:
that any such conclusion is‘erroneous and dangerous and could lead.

. to a complacency which.might well result in curtailment. of.the.U, 5S
