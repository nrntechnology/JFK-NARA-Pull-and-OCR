cooperation,the first: time there as we spoke only to Dr. Fldez. ©
second time, with Despain present, we felt that we should not fo
many ‘details. Dr Fidez. ‘told us that Despain was planning on sx
him with a delegation to Puerto Rico. I feel, as well as Frenk,
this Dr. Fldeze (around 60 yra. old) is a person that could very «
_ organize his office to be of very. valuable service against Castro

‘ his Communists here in the States, as well as in Latin America wh

_.they al ready have. their, own agents operating. It is felt that De
is trying to get Dr. F'dez. out of the way because he recognizes |

importance of the planned Intelligence Service the Frente , throu:
Frdeze, gam which could produce a very strong arm against Castro.

against a former president of Cuba known as Machado. Enclosed is

an idea of how this group functions and are placed into many walke

(fi .

Frente Intelligence Service at 14th Lane Miomi with, ontranc
197 .
in back of building at,15th Street, off Brickell Ave., worked for —

with Ceferino Alvarez(G=2, known as) in Government Insurance(Segu:
Gobierno) ma formerly in the now non-existent BANSECO(branch of”
National Bank of Guba). Josefina Socarras worked with them also :
Seguro det Gobierno « I have written of Josefina before through !
findings of Frank, who kmew them all in Cuba(not Despain directly:
only his family). “This Captain Despain is an intimate friend ‘of +
Ceferino and Josefina(planning to go to New York soon). She has r
trying to get mothing started here, as reported before. It is

strongly urged thrt this Josefina be ‘surveilled constantly as Iy

as well as Frank, think that she is affiliaged with Castro Is cland

Jactivities here in the States. She received monthly checks fron +!
of Centro Refugi ado, Cap tain Despain is planning .on going to join t?
|U. S. Army. He is definitely strongly suspected of giving everyth:

of Intelligence to Castro and is tied in with the Cormunist end Ce:
groups heres He may even soon plan to disappear from the scene -and
should not be allowed to get off easily. He has been kseping Dr.

Jose Julio Fernandez from organizing his anti-Castro and Anti-Coiui
‘files due to lack of funds(says Despain). It seems thatrhis was ju
an excuse before and was done to keep the ball functioning, as.shoul.

bee -2 think that this Dr. Jose - Julio Fernandez is very sincere m:

is innocehtly Giving everything into the hands of Despain without
| knowing. How Despain got into this position is not Imown by us vet.

| As far as we are concerned he | is rr) Castro penetration into the Frent

The above is the, result of being sent to see Dr. Jose Julio Fornande

ce ij head of Intebligence Seryence of the Frente(as told us by Fomor
