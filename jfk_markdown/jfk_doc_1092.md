BRAZILIAN AMBASSADOR ASSESSES JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION

FR WASHINGTON: BRAZILIAN EMBASSY 26 NOV 63

TO RIO DE JANEIRO: FOREIGN MINISTRY URGENT 825
(TWO-PART MESSAGE COMPLETE)

NR. 825.

CONFIDENTIAL.

THE PERSONALITY AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND OF
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON, AS WELL AS THE CIRCUM-
STANCES WHICH BROUGHT HIM TO POWER, SEEM TO INDICATE
THAT AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICIES, UNDER
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION, WILL PROBABLY ADHERE TO THE
FOLLOWING BASIC DIRECTIVES:

1. IN THE SHORT RUN, AS A NATURAL RESULT OF
THE MOMENTUM OF A STRONG ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AS
THAT OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY, NO PROFOUND CHANGES ARE
EXPECTED, ESPECIALLY IN.THE FIELD OF FOREIGN POLICY

(PRESIDENT JOHNSON HAS ALREADY STATED THAT HE WILL :
FOLLOW THE FOREIGN POLICY. OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY) ; |
2. XIN THE LONGER RUN, HOWEVER, ONE CAN FORE-
SEE:
A) IN THE FIELD OF FOREIGN POLICY, WITH
THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OVER THE
WHITE HOUSE "STAFF" (WHICH REFLECTED THE STRONG

(TOP SECRET DINAR

PERSONALITY OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND HIS MARKED
INTEREST IN INTERNATIONAL POLICY), THERE PROBABLY
WILL BE: |

I) NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE FROM THE
KENNEDY LINE IN RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION;
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL TEND TOWARD A WAIT-AND-
SEE ATTITUDE; )

II) IN THE FIELD OF RELATIONS WITH
WESTERN EUROPE, OR MORE PRECISELY WITH FRANCE, A
LESS RIGID ATTITUDE AND ONE OF GREATER ACCEPTANCE
OF THE FRENCH POSITION, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAIN-
TAINING A UNITED WESTERN FRONT VIS-A-VIS THE Posst-
BILITY OF A POLITICAL OFFENSIVE BY THE KREMLIN:

TII) IN RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA,
THE INTERVIEW WHICH PRESIDENT JOHNSON WILL HAVE
THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER WILL cER-
TAINLY BE MORE ENLIGHTENING THAN ANY PREDICTION
MADE AT THIS TIME;

B) IN THE FIELD OF DOMESTIC POLICY, THERE

WILL POSSIBLY BE AN IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN
THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATIVE WITHIN THE LINE
OF "COMPROMISE"; THE NEW PRESIDENT, MUCH MORE THE
CONSERVATIVE THAN THE INNOVATOR, WITH INTIMATE
CONNECTIONS WITH THE CONGRESS, AND A SOUTHERNER,

WILL HAVE MORE FACILITY IN GAINING APPROVAL OF THE
~2—

Cc TOP SECRET DINAR C

BIG BILLS ("CIVIL RIGHTS," "FISCAL REFORM," "MEDICAL
AID," "AID TO THE AGED," ETC,) PRECISELY BECAUSE HE
WILL ACCEPT MORE CONSERVATIVE FORMULAS OF COMPROMISE;
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO TEND TO BE MORE
CONSERVATIVE WITH REGARD TO GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION
IN THE ECONOMY; HOWEVER, RADICAL CHANGES CANNOT BE
EXPECTED, SINCE JOHNSON WILL ALSO FACE THE PRESSURE
OF THE MORE LIBERAL WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
AND ANY MORE PRONOUNCED SPLIT WITHIN THE PARTY WOULD
BE FATAL TO THE HOPES FOR VICTORY IN NEXT YEAR'S
ELECTION,
