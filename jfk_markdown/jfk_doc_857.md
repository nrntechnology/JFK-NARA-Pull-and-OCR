t. This memorandum is for the Director's information only and does

; 2. An invitation by the Government af Cuba to Khrushchev to visit
‘that country hae been officially accepted, but as yet no definite time has
been set. There has been speculation that Khrushchev would arrive In
Habana for the 26th of July celebrations, while a press report, confirming
a statement of the Soviet Ambassador in Mexice, predicts the arrival for
August. Earlier reports had suggested December 1660 or January 1741
as possible dates.

3, Rois felt that a successful visit by Shrushcheyv te Cuba would assist
further in the establishment af a solid Soviet understanding with that country,
with distarbing overtones on the possible establishment of claser Soviet
relationships in other parte of Latin America, For this reason it ie
desirable to prevent the visit er te counteract it by a show of massive

|sppeattion by the Cuban people.

plans. in the exchange of cables that has followed, the Station and Neadqucster:

are pow In agreement that the best course of action lies in two operations.
Flest, a massive church manifestation or rally to be called for some othe:
purnoss would afford the people of Cuba an obvious way to exprese their
protest. Second, the instigation of rarnors that Khrushchev's life will be

\is danger while in Guba from a well-planned assassination attempt wonld
be progagated from other Latin American countries. ,

5S. Because of the need of avelding action in Cuba iin this eratter ths
would imperil Station assets, 1 has been detesiiined that such asaets
be used only aa a means of iustigating the church to hold the sally.

TO 3 CAH/4
Subject: Khrushchev Visit to Cuba

“1. B&ekground. An invitation to visit Cuba has been extended
to Khrushchev by the Governnent of Cuba, The invitation has been

' accepted, but do definite time has been set. There has been sons

speculation that Khrushchev would arrive in Havana in time for the
celebrations of the 26th of July. The press has reported that he
will arrive in August (a date confirmed by a statement of the Soviet
‘Ambassador in Mexico), Other reports say the visit will not teke
place for several months, probably in December or January. In any
event we must plan for tne possibility of the July visit.

It has been stated from several sanguine quarters that we
should "do the same thing to Khrushchev. that the Japs did to Eisen-
‘hower", This is a completely unrealistic drean,

It is true that s successful Khrushchev visit to Cuba
would be the final stoxs in the construction of a solid Soviet
base in Cuba, with disturbing overtones for the pessible construction
for more Soviet ideoligical bases in all.of Latin America, For that
reason we are trying to do what we can to prevent the visit, or at
least to show a naseive sk opposition to it. —

2. ExploitatianPlang. On 21 dune Hgs sent a cable to Havana
‘asking for views on possibility of a major effort to force cancellation
of the vielt. A resulting series of cables shows thst the station and
headquarters are now in agreement that our best hope lies in

a. A massive Church manifestation or rally, which
though called for some other purpose, would be to the pecple
of Cuba an obvious way to express their protest. And

b. from outside Cuba, instigating of rwaors that
Khrushchev’s life will be in danger fem from a well-plenned
assassination attenpt.

.3. Mr. Helms has tcld X us that he wants CIA to undertake no
action that will imperil Station essets, This injunction was placed
on us while we were exchanging cables with Havana. The result is that
station agsets are actively instigatirg the church to hold the rally.
A BREZESSE cable from Headquarters has instructed the station to
continue this course of action as long as there is “safety in numbers",
i.e., as long as it is a church action rather that an AMPALM one.

controlled égeht (in B.A), is soon to visit high officials in
Havana. He.has ben inetructed to ask these leaders what sub- _
stance there might be to the rumore he has heard that an attempt
will take plhace.....Rivas, a friend of Rudy Gomez, is using the
same £etietoxwexteerx technique through three Cubans living in Miami
who are constant contact with Cuba.

Speculation on the assassination sttempts will be surfaced
on the WRUL program, in AMPACA'S paper, etc.
