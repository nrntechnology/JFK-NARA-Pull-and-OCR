1. Primary responsibility for the operational and
administrative handling of the LIEMPTY Project was transferred,
effective 1 December 1970, within the Station from the RED‘OP .
to the Operational Support Section, - This transfer was made
aS part of our effort to consolidate basic Support functions
in the Operational Support Section, and to relieve the REDTOP
Section of activities. which do not contribute directly to the
pursuit.of priority recruitment targets, However, the REDTOP
Section will continue to be the principal consumer of the
LIEMPTY product as received from the LILYRIC and LICALLA
photo surveillance points, It will also be the maio provid-
er of guidnnce and requests for specfal LILYRIC/LICALLA

coverage, . a

2, The provioug REDTOP Case Officer (Bruce H, FERNALD)
introduced the new Case Officer, Howard T, ‘BAGAUS, to LIEMPTY.

“REFERENCE: HMMW-15952, 27 November 1967

1. Headquarters' confusion regarding the various LIE\MPTY
properties is understandable, although each change in location
was duly reported as it occurred, and at various times project
renewal requests, progress reports, and other correspondence has
pinpointed the locations of the base houses involved, The con-
fusion undoubtedly stems from the unfortunate fact that LIMITED
and LILYRIC in effect exchanged appromimate locations in 1966
without changing cryptonyms, Up to this point, LIMWITED had been
in a building owned by WOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE frenting fer WOFIRY).
LILYRIC had been renting an‘apartment in a building in which
WOFITRM had no financial interest. In 1265, however, LINOCUSINE
“bought the property cov ning the building in whieh LIMITED had
been located, raced tiie building, and built a new building. in
which an apartment was rented to the Station (the rent, however,
was to be returned to the Station for three years as partial
payment on the loan which the Station had given LIMOUSINE so that
he could buy the building), For various operational reasons it
was decided to put the LILYRIC personnel into the new building,
instead of the LIMITED crew, LIMITED was therefore moved into the

’ building which LILYRIC had occupied, At, this point, of course,
new cryptonyms Should probably have been: assigned in order to

7 avoid the. confusion which has evidently develcped, (‘This vas not,

however, simply a switch of personnel ~ each base house retained...

its organizational integrity, which is undoubtedly why crypts were

nol changed). As far as LICALLA is concerned, the confusica

DISPATCH |

Probably stems from the,-tact that, while sts Lacation “ne not
changed, it is located within the "LIMveT buildbays, which’ is
owned by WOFIRM (with LIMOUSINE’ acting as 3t) and which ts
adninistered. within the LIMLSA project. As slated, however, all
of this’ has been carefully documented for Headquarters seh “The .
LIMOUSINE purchase of thé old LIMITED bullding senerated iconsid=
erable correspondence (see particularly #eAL 21du and bit T7745
of January 1965), 1 MAS2 8322 and HMMAj204d03 Bpelled out: the”
reasons tor switching LILYRIC and LIMITZD, and the completion

of the move was reported in HMMA\~30687, Finally, sketches and
Plans of the LILYRIC and LIMITED touges in their new locations

as LICALLA is concerned, its location and status was never open
to question, and its location in the LI“UST complex is Fegularly -

stands that’ a memo describing the locations of the various base
houses was attached to the most recent LIMESA project renewal
request wheo it was submitted to the staits by WH/1. I:

2, Personnel withia the base houses js also well-décumented
(most of the LIEMPTY progress reports have identified each agent
ad the personnel have sever Leon switched from
house to house, ‘Perhaps the best rundown of these personnel is
Raymond H. GERENDE's security review, forwarded with HMMA~31164,

24 January 1967, . . :
It

“Station Real Property reports are also, with one
exception (MEXI=41), up-to-date and they reflect current condi~
tions. MEXI-03 does, of course, include LICALLA, Nevertheless,
the Station asked for $1800 for rent: and utilities for the
following reasons; first of all, utilities are an unrecoverable
expense no matter who owns the apartment. Secondly, the’ rent,
even though returned to the Station because iWOFIRM owns) the
building, must. physically be paid by the occupant of LICALLA,

He, in turn, is reimbursed by the Station via GERENDE, | LIMOUSINE
eventually returns the money, at which tine it is credited to
expense, This-could, of course, be handled differently! but the
Station has always found it convenient to finance in this manner,
largely because finances with LIMOUSINE are handled on a! semi-

menths after the payment.

, 4, The Station neglected to cancel MzXI-41, which) should
be done as it refers to LILYRIC in its old location, before the
move in 1966, LILYRIC is now MEXI[-132, and is in the building
owned by LIMOUSINE, Rent payments are, as originally latended;
being used to‘help liquidate LIMOUSINE's debt, and, as Ynatructed
in HMMS-4814, 15 June 1966, the Station is erediting this money
to miscellaneous receipts, There can be, therefore, no question

of the need to include money for LILYRIC rent and utilities in
ce the

which amounts to $2,880 per year ($3, 200 has been requested dna
order to include utilities). Headquarters is correct in! statiog

was 2,300 pesos rer month. Statior files indicate that, the
reason for the increase (and this apparently was not reported
was that the bank which holds the na jor. Part
of LIMOUSINE's loan. had determined that 3 ,2909 pesos was a fair
price for the apartment, The Station had, of course, no, choice
but to go along with this, . ; ie

5. The Station has no record of MEXI-92, but it ie likely
that this is the old LIMITED apartment, which was indeed
purchased by WOFIRM (via LIMOUSINE) in 1955 But since that

IMOUSINE, the old
LIMITED apartment ceased to exist. The LIMITED base house was
subsequently transferred to the building which had previously
housed LILYRIC (ut not to the same apartmenb, and LIMITED is’

Station iWoriny + no ¢: terest in the bu Thus
At is evident that the Li ject reneval, whi used to
say 'LIMITKD and LICALLA rents aré returned to Station by
LIMOUSINN and credited to Station miscellaneous receipts" should
new carry the footnote "LICALLA rent is returned to the Station
and credited to -exvense; LILYNIC rent is, and will be through
September 1963, returned to the Station by LIMOUSINES and credited
ton scellaneous receipts as partial raynent on Statioa loan to

LIMOUSINE."

6. Finally, the LIEMPTY darkroom ig the room where the
films taken by LICALLA, LILYRIC,. LINITED, and LIENTRAP are

‘developed, printed, and (on request) enlarged by LIEMPTY-4,

_ his ‘darkroom is located in GERENDS's apartment, and he is paid
1,000 pesos per month for maintenance of the darkroom in
recognition. ‘of the fact that one room in his living quarters
has been turned into a darkroom, and his electric and water
bills are substantially higher than they would normally be with
‘out a darkroom on the premises, GERENDE id building a house

“which he expects to occupy in February 1968, ‘His plans for the
house specifically include a LIEMFTY darkroom, and he will continue
to be paid 1,000 pesos per month for this. To cover this payment
in the new house, MEXI-137 has been written and will be forwarded
to Headquarters shortly,

> . history - means ‘that we must turn to you with questions

! oftener than you might wish, Our present question
concerns property involved in LIEMPTY, (We are submitting
the.project as. received from the field, but do not ©

“understand, the. ‘background very well. )

La 2, HMMA-11257 of 16 January 1959," a project renewal, said-
that "approximately one year ago the LICALLA base was 2
purchased ‘by KUBARK through:. LIMOUSINE", and we ‘have not found
any. cables or dispatches which would show a change in that
status. Does MEXI 03 LIMUST/LIMESA (see Real Property Report
of August 1967) Include LICALLA? If go, ‘and if we own
LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and
‘utilities? | (Up until the subaission dated 1963 the project
renewal used to say “LIMITED and BICALLA rents are returned.
to station by LIMOUSINE and credited to station miscellaneous
receipts" but after that time this sentence was eliuinated.)

3. LIMITED is a different vrobtem complicated by .

‘the fact. that we are no-longer sure what the name refers -"

to. Originally we bought LIMITED and then sold it in

January 1965 to LIMOUSINE who put up a new building on
“the lot..andsaved an apartment for our use, LIMOUSINE

now owns: the’ new building, ‘but"MEXT 02, LIMITED Ssafchouse"™

jis shown on the Renal Property Report as "purchased" by :
WOFIRM in 1955 - should this not be corrected? A further
| complication is that ‘HMMA -31164, GERENDE's January 1967

’ gecurity review, speaks of LILYRIC in its present new
‘.:ocation, Inhabited by LIEMPTY/13, /14 and /27, Has the

old LIMITED been re-christened LILYRIC because of its new -
“4{nhabitants?.. When was it completed and are we still
“withholding rent from LIMOUSINE in settlement of his
payment -to us forthe property. The REAL Property Report shows
LILYRIC, MBXI. 41, a5 having been leased in 1958 and
costing $1030. to maintain ($856 rent, $44 reparis, and $130.
utilities). “It also shows MEXI 132 LIMEPTY, LIMOUSINE, LILYRIC
