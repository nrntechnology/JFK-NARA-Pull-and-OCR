7 INTRODUCTION

The following summary and analysis is not intended to be
all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi-
zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished
a by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO: To attempt to do 80 ‘would be repetitious
and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the
formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of

primary concern.

This summary will not contain a detailed psychological

“ assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain’a recitation of the numerous
theories which have been: promulgated in the past concerning varying 2 . -

‘aspects of the NOSENKO case. This summary will be primarily

directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was not

“e dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively

plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in — . ‘.
a reassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO

has admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that ~

. these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance - Lo . : vee

but not to misiead this Agency in any material matters of an operational
or policy nature. :

In order to avoid any misunderstanding of the phrase "bona
fides" as considered in this summary, NOSENKO will be judged primarily
on whetocr he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB kno-wledge,
and whether his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this
Agency were known to the KGB. . Motivation and certain other pertinent
aspects will be considered, but his admitted previous errors, lies and
exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is nota
"“wona fide" defector.

There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement
against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or .
correlated to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer, For
purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas
considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may differ in regard to
whether this arbitrary standard is a completely accurate standard, but it
is felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from other

sources derived through independent investigation will permit the reader

to assess the information-in toto against any standard he considers

appropriate,
The previous summary on NOSENKO entitled, "The. Exami-

nation of the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector, “has been considered ‘in

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN NOSENKO CASE
. SINCE 30 OCTOBER 1967

Since 30 October 1967, interviews with Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO.
have been conducted by one individual not previously known personally to
NOSENKO but who has been aware of the NOSENKO case since June 1962,

Interviews have been detailed and very extensive in scope, have
been recorded and transcribed, and have covered the entire life and caree:
of NOSENKO without regard to whether a particular aspect had been,
covered during previous interview or interviews,

NOSENKO, although naturally apprehensive during the firet few
interviews, has been cooperative, has developed a relaxed attitude, and
the interviewer has noted no gignificant reluctance to discuss any aspect

of his life, career, or activities. On occasion NOSENKO has indicated a

. reluctance to maxe positive statements in certain areas previously

considered at a minimum extremely controversial. This reluctance

was understandable and when it became apparent to NOSENKO that the

eat

14-0000

szcunc

interviewer would not dispute or disparage his statements without adequate
reason, this reluctance on the part of NOSENKO, in tie opinion of the
interviewer, totaiiy disappeared,

During the interviewing period, particularly in the iirst six months,
NOSENKO materially assisted the interviewer by preparing approximately
sixty memoranda on such diverse subjects as his life, motivation for de-
fection, individual cases, notes which he furnished to CIA in 1964, KGB
organization, and KGB officer and agent personalities. As an example
of the scope of this work by NOSENKO, four of the memoranda included

oO
remarks concerning approximately [875|KGB ofiicers, [loo|xca agents,
a 35 GRU officers, ana[a00 other Soviet nationals. These lists were alpha-
betically arranged and the above indicated cooperation of NOSENKO has
materially assisted in the organization and evaluation of information
furnished by him curing current interviews.

Copies of transcripts of interviews with NOSENKO and related
memoranda have been disseminated to the FBl and the Cl Stafi. Special
Agent Elbert Turner and Special Agent James Wooten of the Washington
Field Office/FB1 in particular have given great assistance in research
and compilation of new or additional information and the FBI has inter-
viewed or reinterviewed a number of United States citizens concerning

whom NOSENKO has furnished pertinent information,

aa , In addition, throe professionals from the SB Division have . ‘
reviewed ths current information and assiated in the retrieval of

previous information from NOSENKO and collation of current

information with previous informath-a. The latter ‘s a tremendous

task because of the volume of material; the number of individual

cases involved; and the extensive information in regard to KGB . :
persenalities, precedures, organizational etructure end activities.
Tho SB Division elso provided tha services ofan expert
translator to translate the tapes of the 1965 interrogation of HOSENKO
_ by Petr DERYABIN and one of the previotisly mentioned three pro-
fessionala completed a new translation of the 1962 interviews with

NOSENKO. In addition, transcriptions of certain other porticularly

pertinent previous interviewa of NosENKO have been completed by
the Office of Security. :

Approximately 7000 pages of transcripts and related material
have been compiled and diazeominated aince late October 1967. Com-
iments concerning the value of the information contained in the sbove

. material aro contained in another section of tats summary. As of the
. x present thne, 8 complete anslysis is not possible since a considerable
. portion of the material bae not been fully proceaced. In the propsration

"lof this semmary all areas of major significance have been examined. ~

ANALYTICAL COMMENTS CONCERNING THE BONA FIDES OF

YURIY IVANOV:ICH NOSENKO

As indicated in the introduction to tais summary, information in
‘regard to Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO will be considered against an arbi-
trary but realistic list of areas considered pertinent to the question of
whether NOSENKO voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB

knowledge, and whether his. 1962'and early 1964 contacts with represent-

" atives of this Agency were known to the KGB.

It was noted that motivation and certain other pertinent aspects

‘leo be ‘onside d but’ hat hie admitted’previous lies and exag- °
gerations. would not per se warrant a Gonelusion that NOSENKO is nota
"bona. fide defector,"'

The following is a list of the areas considered pertinent and which

are being given specific consideration, Attached is a separate section

containing remarks in regard to the designated areas of A-H,

A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims

to be?

. B,. Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible?

F. Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in
information furnished by. NOSENKO which would warrant |

a conclusion that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB?

G. Is there evidence of a political or any other type objective

A, Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims to be?
During interviews NOSENKO has furnished detailed information in regard
to his family, his activities as a youth, the schools he attended, assoc-
jates of his father and iether, and his own associates, The period
under consideration in this section is tne period preceding his. entry
into the First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid
March 1953. :

Information furnished by NOSENKO concerning his father and

mother and his early, life, together with other information such asa

_comparison of photographs of NOSENKO and a photograph of his father

and confirmed travel of his mother to Western Europe in 1956 with

Madame KOSYGINA, conclusively establish that he.is Yuriy Ivanovich

-NOSENKO, the son of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, the Minister of Ship-

building in the USSR prior to his death in 1956, This is also satisiactorily .
supported by personal-type information furnished by NOSENKO concern-

ing. other associates of his father and mother.

Since, as indicated above, there is considered to be no doubt
that Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO is the son of the former Minister of

Shipbuilding, a detailed study of his life prior to 1945 (age 18) is of:

iittie or no value in assessing ti.c bona fides or non-bona fides of
NOSENKO. An expose of his youthful indiscretions, of which he has
admitted a number, is of no import in a discussion of whether NOSENKO
was or was not dispatched by the KGB, Obtaining any coilaterai ‘irst-
hand information in regard to NOSENKO beiore 1945 would be of
negligible value, but there actually is supporting information from
Nikolay ARTAMONOV, a defector from the Soviet Navy, concerning
the claimed attendance by NOSENKO at a military-naval preparatory
school in Leningrad. :

NOSENKO, during current interviews, has stated that he grad-

graduated in 1949'since it was a four-year course, but failed the final
examination in Marxiem and therefore was required to attend the Institute
for a longer period of time and again take his final examinations,

Based on information furnished by NOSENKO concerning co-
students and the Institute, there is no reason to doubt that he actually i
attended and graduated from the Institute of International Relations in
1950. The previous controversy in this matter was complicated by
NOSENKO who, in 1964 after his defection, stated in a biography that

Ps he had graduated from the Institute in 1949. | Actually this statement

by NOSENXO in 1964 resulted in conflicting information since NOSENKO

on 9 June 1962 during his first contact with CIA had stated that he

"completed the Institute of International Relations in 1950."" NOSENKO

has given the explanation that he changed the date of his graduation to

1949 because he did not wish to admit that he had failed to graduate in.

1949. NOSENKO explained that this change in his date of graduation

caused him to pre-date his actual entry into Navy Intelligence to 1950

instead of 1951 and his actual entry into the KGB from 1953 to 1952.

The above action by NOSENKO is included in what NOSENKO has

' characterized as hie "stupid blunders." The latter is a rather apt:

characterization of his now admitted lies and exaggerations but is not

” evidence’ that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. It'is evidence of °°

a certain personality trait of NOSENKO who has in the past by his own

admission tended to enhance his importance and astuteness by graphically

portraying his personal participation in KGB activities concerning which

he had knowledge but did not personally participate,

.

The claimed service of NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence during

March 1951 to early 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas has been

seriously questioned in the past. Specific comments on this period of

: time are contained in a separate section of this summary, but it is

' considered that the recent interviews of NOSENKO satisfactorily sub-

stantiate his claimed service in Navy Intelligence during March 1951
to early 1953.

Attached is a typed copy ofa handwritten memorandum completed
by NOSENKO on 31 October 1967, This is a. biographical statement con-
cerning his jife and KGB career. No effort has been made to correct
grammatical errors or spelling since to do so would be in conflict with
the manner in which current interviews were conducted; namely, to give
NOSENKO an opportunity to recdunt his life.and activities to permit are-
examination of the entire case. The comprehension and fluency of
NOSENKO in the English language was adequate for interview purposes
in October 1967 and both have materially improved since that time.

_ Interviews of and memoranda prepared by. NOSENKO since

* 31 October 1967 have not indicated any material discrepancies with the

statements of NOSENKO in the attached memorandum, One change that
a

has-been miade by NOSENKO is that he now dates his transfer from the .

‘First Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, to the Seventh

Department, SCD, as occurring in the latter part of May 1955 rather

. than June + July 1955 as indicated in the attached statement. NOSENKO

{personnel evaluation) was prepared on NOSENKO in March - April
1955 rather than May - June 1955, Since the unsatisfactory personnel
report was directly related to his transfer to the Seventh Department, \
neither of the above changes are considered to be of a significant nature,

An- effort has been made during current interviews to differentiate between ’
errors due to faulty memory and discrepancies indicative of deception by

NOSENKO.

an

reason why NOSENKO {rom his point of view should remember such

at this time. Onthe other hand, it is not reasonable that NOSENKO
would lay claim to the title of Deputy Chief of the First Section, First
Department, if this were not true when he clearly knew of the visits of
GOLITSYN to the First Section in 1960 - 1961 and of his conferences
with officers closely associated with NOSENKO at that time,

NOSENKO has also mentioned a number of ofiicers of the SCD -

or former officers of the SCD who transferred to the FCD with whom

ot

he was personally acquainted and who were also known to GOLITSYN, .

: A number of these officers were officers from whom GOLITSYN has-

stated he obtained certain information or through whom he became aware

of cértain activities including Vladislav M. KOVSHUK, Gennadiy 1.

GRYAZNOV, Viadimir Ivanovich PETROV, Yuriy I, GU, Viadimir

A. CHURANOV, Yevgeniy GROMAKOVSKIY and Vadim V, KOSOLAPOV,

The statement of NOSENKO that although he had heard of
GOLITSYN he had never personally met GOLITSYN, stands in conflict.
with the statements of GOLITSYN that he, GOLITSYN, had met and
talked with NOSZNKO in the SCD in the late 1950's. The description

of GOLITSYN of this meeting is that of a casual encounter in the halls

rather than a specific office visit, In light of this, the absence of any

‘an encounter and the absence of any reason for NOSENKO to lie on this -

aetna COE ea

issue, it is eminently reasonable to conciude that the encounter took
place but that NOSENKO simply has no recollection of it. There is
no reason to attach sign-cicance to this lapse of memory.

The previous opinion that NOSENKO did not hoid the claimed |

pasition of Deputy Chiei, First Section, First Department, during 1960 = .

1961 has had the most mer:t in the controversy over hia statements |
relative to-his KGB career, This particular aspect will be covered in.

detail in another section, but of note at this time is the controversy

over what duties the position of Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD, KGB,

entails or does not entail, It is a fruitless exercise to attempt to judge ,

t

whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the First Section in 1960 - 1961 °”

on the basis of whether his knowledge of the total activities of the First —
Section was commensurate with the knowledge of a Deputy Branch Chief
in CIA in regard to the activities of the entire Branch,

Whether NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD,
KGB, must be judged on the basis of what were the duties oi a Deputy
Chief of Section in the SCD and in particular what were his duties in
the particular assignment. The organizational structure of the KGB

may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure

i
i

of CIA, but any similarities are surely not such as to permit a judgment

‘salary structure, Pay of a KGB officer is-based on military rank and

of a comparison oi his activities and responsibilities with that inherent
in a.somewhat similar position in CIA,

One of the most. important differences between United States

of agencies or organizations in the USSR, including the KGB, is the

support, There are too many intangible aspects involved and although
motivation is an important factor, full resolution of the motivation .

NOSENKO and others of his generation have lived in a Soviet society

throughout their entire lives, The environment is an important factor
of influence in the life of an individual and true disillusionment is at

best usually a gradual process in which many factors, some recognized

or aera

and some not recognized by the individual, have played a role in varying |

degrees.

NOSENKO, until 1955 and possibiy until'the death of his father :

lin August 1956, could be compared to the profligate son of wealthy

‘parents in the United States who finally graduates from college and obtains

‘ ~ . -employment. perhaps in the firm of‘his father without actually earning any of

an _ the; luxariés he has enjoyed. “The fathér of NOSENKO was not only wealthy
by Soviet standards but also held a high government position. The
influence of his father and the name.oi ais iather undoubtedly was an
ae important if not the most important actor in NOSENKO éven being

“ ; particularly reluctant to admit, perhaps even to himself, . that this was:

the primary reason.

.The above should not be construed as any reflection on the

actual intelligence of NOSENKO, but rather as an explanation of how

‘D., Is the information furnished by NOSENKXO to CIA concerning
_-KGB operations, personalities, and organization reasonably commen-

surate with his claimed KGB career? The conclusion is that the infor-

mation furnished by NOSENKO concerning KGB operations, personalities,

-and organization is more than reasonably commensurate with his claimed

_ , career in the KGB from mid-March’1953 to his: defection in early February

1964,
~ In. reaching the above conclusion, consideration has been given

to his.claimied. departmental assignments and claimed -positions in each ~ '

3 -department. Certain allowance has been made for faulty memory with
consideration being given to whether there is any indication of deception
or whether the failure to recall a particular item of interest can logically

be attributed to the vagaries of the human mind, There is, of course, no

‘accurate standard of measurement which would permit a positive deter-

‘mination as to whether inability to recall certain details or events is
: vactually due to the fact that the human mind cannot recall all past events

An effort has been made to determine if there are any particular
patterns or areas where NOSENKO has indicated he did not recall

specific matters or certain details, and.no pattern or specific areas

have been noted. NOSENKO, in fact, has an unusually good memory

as evidenced by the extensive information jurnished by NOSENKO purely

from recollection, In addition, there has been no material reluctance
on the part of NOSENKO to discuss his entire life, KGB officers he has
known, KGB organization and procedures, or other topics of interest.

. NOSENKO has furnished considerable detail concerning KGB
officers whom he has known at various periods in his entire KGB career,

He. has been very consistent in information furnished and has frequently
added certain details which he ‘recalled ata later date,

Certain remarks will be made in another section in regard to
the volume and scope of information furnished by NOSENKO. This in-
formation is not selective, but isan excellent indicator that NOSENKO
was assigned to the First Department and Seventh Department, SCD,
during the claimed periods of time and held the claimed positions. Con-

i

‘sideration has been given to his various claimed KGB assignments in

evaluating the information furnished in an effort to assess whether-his

a particular period of time or suggested the possibility that he did not

occupy the position which he claimed to have held.
It is considered that information furnished by NOSENKO supports
“his claimed positions in the SCD. it has not been possible to substantially
confirm through collateral sources that NOSENKO served in his claimed
positions, ' Neither has it been possible to obtain from other sources an
applicable description of the duties or responsibilities of an individual
: holding any of the positions NOSENKO claimed to have held after 1958. It
is felt there can be no question that NOSENKO served in the capacities of = .,
junior case officer, case officer, and senior case officer during 1953 - 1957,

As r as the duties and responsibilities ofa Deputy Chief of Section,

Chief of Section, ‘and Deputy Chief of Department, and whether NOSENKO.
held these various claimed positions, a considerable amount of personal
judgment has been necessary. This personal judgment has been made in
as judicial @ manner as possible, with full knowledge that any opinion in
, regard to- the above is largely dependent upon information from NOSENKO,

he claims to have occupied and surrounding offices during the four pri-

and other personnel, and changes of personnel, as well as diagrams

of the offices of the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of the SCD during'1956 -

1964. This material is internally consistent. Furthermore NOSENKO

could not: possibly have known that thie detailed information could not

immediately be checked for accuracy,-at least in. part, with a source

or another officer who has defected since mid-1964, If these diagrams —*

arid memoranda were not relatively correct, NOSENKO, who is quite
astute in matters of counterintelligence, would hardly have voluntarily
prepared the material in such detail. This type of information is

peculiarly adaptable for analysie by a knowledgeable source or by another

. defector ‘and could, if not relatively correct, permit a ‘rather positive con- ‘

clusion that NOSENKO was lying or fabricating ‘information,
NOSENKO has furnished quite specific information on KGB
operations during the 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -

less.gor the 1953 ~ 1955 period; but his own personal situation and,attitude-
until 1955 - 1956, which are mentioned elsewhere, should be given

The knowledge of NOSENKO- concerning cases, KGB operations,
and other officers can consistently be related to his claimed department
and position assignment during the 1953 to January 1964 period, The
scope of his knowledge of his own department when considered in toto
“is broadez ‘after 1957 than before, which i is compatible with his claim of
increased responsibilities. His knowledge of the work of other departments
of.the SCD from the late 195035 on is also more. extensive, which is also a. 7

Baoed om the original lead tofermation from NOSENKO that "ZHARI"

was Victor Norris HAMILTON, aka Fevu-t biltrt HINDALY, a former

NSA eroployee who defocted to the USSR in 1962, and the information

fvom NOSENKO was nover disseminated or investigated. (
Prior to the surfacing of Jobn Discos SMITH by the Sovists

of American code clerks was being investigated; and John Discoe :

SMITH was & leading cuspect. After the curfacing of SMITH by the : F

Soviets, it became apparent that SMITH, rather than HAMILTON, was

tdentical to "ZHARI," Investigation disclosed that no defiatte informa-

tion could be established in regard to the actual whereaboute of SMITH

after circa mid-1960. It cannot be positively etated that appropriate

favestigetion in 1964 of the "ZHARI" lead would have led to the identi-

fication of Joha Discos SMITH as "ZHARI." However, such (dontifi-

cation would have been of considerable interest to the Department of

Servicos had complled a list at twenty suspects, including VASSALL.

- Even though it may be presumed that trvestigation of the twenty suspects

would ultimately have resulted in a determination that VASSALL wag
the agent on whom GOLITSYN had furnished certain information, the
information from NOSENKO tn June 1962 resulted in the earlier termi-
nation by the British Services of a still valuable productive KGB agent.

Although not the cace of a KGB agent, the matter of tha mlcro-
pboags in the United States Embasey should also be mentioned,
GOLITSYN, following his defection in Cecernber 1961, furnished
certain information in regard to microphones in.the United States
Embasay (Chancery). Since in fact the microphones we.¢ connected
to contral cables, location of ona microphone would logically have led
to the exposure of the entire set of inicrophones. However, appro-
priate action was not taxen on thia information and the KGB would have
beon aware Mart no action was taken prior to June 1962 when NCSENKD
firet contacted CLA.

Li NOSENKO te a dispatched KGS agent, It is not clear why the

e

KGB would attract spscific attention to a system of microphones which
mat have still had some valve ae of June 1962. A presumption may
be made that if NOSENKO was a dispatched agent, the KGB had, as of
1962, an advanced system of monitoring devices which rendered the
above: microphone system obsolete. However, no concrete evidence
of such an advanced system is available and it should be noted that it

F. Is there evidence of KGB deception or ''give away" in
inforraation furnished by NOSENKO which would warrant a conclusion
that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB? The conclusion in this
summary is that NOSENKO was not dispatched by the KGh. in

reaching this conclusion, a full examination of the above «.< Siion has

es

been both a necessary and integral part.

It is inherent that the volume of information furnished by
NOSENKO is only one of the factors which should be given consideration
in arriving at a conclusion that NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by
the KGB. If NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, the KGB would have
surely been willing to sacrifice certain information of value to the KGB
in order te support the bona fides of NOSENKO. However, if NOSENKO
was dispatched, it must have been to accomplish or further a KGB
purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be
unknown,

An examination of the circumstances under which NOSENKG first
contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his behavior during these contacts is
particularly pertinent since during this period of time NOSENKO would
have surely been under direct KGB control if there are any implications

of KGB dispatch in the NOSENKO case.

14-00000

NOSENKO has stated that his original approach to "sell two
pieces of information" was his own idea as to what was most lixely to
“be successful, NOSENKO has stated that he wanted to make a contact
with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the 1
time, and felt that if he merely stated that he was a "KGB counter- '
intelligence ofiicer who wanted to give information," he very possibly
would be rejected. It should be noted that NOSENKO even during his
first contact did not limit his remarks to the "two pieces of information"
and began to talk quite freely on other matters,
If NOSENKO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 1962
contacts, would have been very carefully briefed and that his remarks
or statements would have not been of a nature which could cause any
suspicion in regard to the bona fides of NOSENKO. Instead, a current
review of his statements and remarks during his five contacts in 1962
indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and actual lies were quite*
likely typical of a braggadocio element in the personality of NOSENKO
and may also have been evidence supporting the statement by NOSENKO
that he usually had a few drinks of liquor before each contact in

Geneva.

NOSENKO, during his five contacts in Geneva, made many
statements which in retrospect were impossioie, and the investigation
of which could only have raised certain questions con 2rning NOSENKO.
The following is a list of the more obvious areas in which NOSENKO
made gross exaggerations or mace incorrect or impossible statements.

{a) NOSENKO claimed he personally was with

Oleg M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the SCD, during the

recruitment pitch to[Tames sieasazag (This was

a lie and an interview with Bron Ben dwita display -

of photograph would have disclosed that NOSENKO

did not participate. )

(b) NOSENKO was involved in the recruitment

, approach to Russell LANGELLE. (This was a lie and
LANGELLE was available for interview. ) 6

{c) NOSENKO said he recruited [LUNT ovace

{d) NOSENXO claimed personal contact with] =dmund oO
STEVENS|who, according to NOSENKO, hae been recruited
by the KGB. (NOSENKO actually had never personaiiy met
(Erbvexg and only had seen[STEVENS|once at a distance. )
{e) NOSENKO dated the recruitment of "ANDREY"
in Moscow as 1949-1950. At the same time he furnished
information that "ANDREY" (who is considered identical to
, Dayle Wallis SMITH) was in Moscow during a part of the time
that Roy RHODES, also a recruited agent, was assigned to
Mescow, 1951-1953. “ANDREY" (SMITH) was actually in
Moscow 1952-1954,
(7) NOSENKO said he, GRIBANOV, and another officer
met Edward Ellis SMITH. (NOSENKO has since stated be did
not meet SMITH and that his only role was obtaining a foreign
typewriter and paper for a KGB agent involved in the SMITH
operation. }
(g) NOSENKXO in a number of instances spoke in the
first person, saying “We did this," or "We did that," in

xeference to a particular KGB activity in which he now admits

4 , G0041082

3/IGR
14-00000

he was not involved but had some knowledge. (If

NOSENKO was under XGB control in 1962, both he

and the 47GB should Lave known that these indicated

exaggerations would eventually lead to a question

concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO. )

In 1962-1963 a number of similarities were noted between
information furnished by NOSENKO and information which had been
furnished by GOLITSYN prior to June 1962. These similarities were
quite striking and gave riseto certain suspicions of NOSENKO because
he provided information which the KGB would presumably have considered
already compromised as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN. Certain
of the similarities at the time could only be explained in terms of
NOSENKO being a dispatched agent. The following are some examples of
the similarities noted,

(a) Both furnished information in regard to
[Johan PREISFREUND} OG
{b) Both furnished information in regard toa
[Military code clerk case (James STORSBERG}L 08, ne
(c) Both furnished information in regard toa
trip of Viadislav KOVSHUK, under an assumed name, <

: to the United States. (GOLITSYN was sure it was

connected with a reactivation of an agent formerly in

Moscow, or a recruitment of an s\rnerican formerly

related it directly to the "ANDREY" case, giving the

assumed name which KOVSHUK used. )
(4) Both furnished information in regard to
microphones in the United States Embassy in Moscow.
(e) Both furnished information in regard to
{Bamand STEVENS]and[fsaac Hen HAPIRO}

The above list is not complete nor does it indicate the actual
differénces in the amount of information furnished on any particalar
topic by GOLITSYN and NOSENKO. To cite the above in detail in this
summary is believed unnecessary since the only point of real interest
is whether the fact that NOSENKO was aware of certain events, cases,
ov situations of which GOLITSYN was also aware raises a legitimate
question concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO.

The above area of concern has been thoroughly examined and
itis considered that the fact that NOSENKO durnished some information
on certain cases or situations previously mentioned in lesser or

greater detail by GOLITSYN cannot logically be construed as evidence

‘that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. NOSZENKO has during

current interviews satisiacitorily sourced his information in alm: st

every instance. In a few instances he has said ne did not recall -

how he learned of a particular piece of information but these

apparent lapses of memory were not large in number and are

considered to be in no way suspicious, i

The general area in which there was a similarity between

: information furnished by GOLITSYN in late 1961 - early.1962 and
information furnished by NOSENKO in June 1962 and which would have
been the most significant insofar as the security of the United States
Government was or is concerned related to certain activities centering
around or in the First Department, SCD.

It is the conclusion of this summary that NOSENKO was an

officer of the First Section, First Department, SCD, during 1953-1955

and was Deputy Chief of the same section in 1960 - 1961. Therefore,
the fact that NOSENKO furnished information concerning certain cases
or situations in the First Department and the fact that GOLITSYN
furnished information concerning the same case or situation is not

unusual or necessarily suspicious. NOSENKO has stated that GOLITSYN

that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief of the First Section in 1900 has
been noted and commented on in another section of this summary.

GOLITSYN has furnished certain information which he re-
ceived from officers of the First Section, First Department, SCD. t
In each instance where this information, which was fragmentary, could
not be immediately correiated with information from NOSENKO, it was
previously considered to be evidential of deception or lying on the part
of NOSENKO, This position, however, failed to allow for the possibility
that the discrepancies between the two sources were, at least in certain
instances, more apparent than real,

In certain instances it has now been possible to correlate irag-
mentary information from GOLITSYN with information from NOSENKO,
making it evident that in these instances the differences could not be
construed aa in any way reflecting against NOSENKO. The four examples
cited below represent two probable correlations, (a) and (b); one possible
correlation, (c); and one instance where, no correlation is possible at this
time, (d):

(a) GOLITSYN furnished information which he

NOSENKO, occurred in 1959 and was an operation of the First

the spring of 1960 that GRYAZNLV had developed an operation

This is believec to undcubiedly be a reference to the case of

There is considered to be a good possibility that
GOLITSYN actually learned of the above information from
GRYAZNOV in early January 1961 when he was again in Moscow
rather than during the spring of 1960 when GOLITSYN was
‘preparing ior his assignment to Helsinki, Finland. This
theory is supported by information on page 163 of the previous

The previous summary also states that according to
GOLITSYN, the KGB had photographed the American in
various homosexual acts, but SHELEPIN, who had just
become Chairman of the KGB, was at the time stressing

One of the above homosexual agents succeeded in

photographed by the KGB but, according to NOSENKO,

_ although the photographs were of a good quality, the KGB

was unable to use the photographs in 1959 because of a

general ban by the Central Committee on the recruitment

of the United States Exhibition guides due to the planned

visit of President EISENHOWER to the Sovict Union.
NOSENKO also stated that the compromising materiai

and information on BARAET vas later given to the First

Section, First Department when he returned with another

Exhibition in 1961, and that he, NOSENKO, was not involved in

A theory which has previously been given consideration and
warranted full consideration was that if NOSENKO was dispatched,
his mission was to confuge leads furnished to American intelligence

and/or to denigrate the. value of information furnished by GOLITSYN.

In connection with this theory, it should be noted taat NOSENKO during

current interviews has not made any remarks which could in any way
be construed as derogatory to GOLITSYN. In addition, NOSENKO does
not claim to Have any detailed knowledge of the FCD and frequently,

when some topic peculiar to the FCD has been broached with NOSENKO,

“his immediate reply has been to the effect that "I didn't work in the FCD,"

xi ‘should ask GOLITSYN about that.”
In-conneetion with any consideration of whether the contact of
NOSENKO with CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have been initiated by
the KGB as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN,: the timing, of certain
events should be noted.. GOLITSYN defected on is December 1961.
NOSENKO departed from Moscow in March 1962 for Geneva, ‘Switzerland,
where he remained until 15 June 1962. ,

‘it is felt that it would have been practically impossible if not

imposéible for KGB officials to complete an assessment of the.actual or

potential damage which could result from the defection of GOLITSYN,
14-00000

SeGues

select NOSENKO as the individual who would be dispatched to counter-
act tne possible damage, and appropriately brief NOSENKO prior to
his departure for Geneva in March 1962. Therefore, if NOSENKO , : . 4
was dispatched by the KGB, it would appear that pians for this would
have predated the defection of GOLITSYN and that any GOLITSYN

aspect could only be a related aspect and not the basis for the original

plan to dispatch NOSENKO. In addition, if NOSENKO was dispatched, . , i
it would hardly seem necessary for the KGB to send NOSENKO to
Geneva two and one-half months before his first contact with CIA.
The theory has also been considered that NOSENKO could have ‘

been dispatched to confuse and divert American intelligence and thus

‘to protect an important KGB penetration or penetrations of the United
States Government, particularly CIA. This is a theory which should
and has been given full consideration, out it is not possible to factualiy

substantiate or refute this theory in the absence of specific information_
Srenneare or vent.

that high-level KGB penetrations do or do not exist,
Actually, as regards NOSENKO, the primary area which should
be given consideration in the above matter is if all the information from

NOSENKO is accepted, what effect would or could it have on the efforts :

that there would be little consolation or assurance to American intelli-

gence even if every statement by NOSENKO was accepted at face value,
The only specific area in which NOSENKO could be even con-

sidered to claim full knowledge is the United States Embassy in Moscow.

In this area hie statements could be construed as assurance that there

were no recruitments of American personnel in the United States Embassy

in Moscow from 1953-December 1963 with.the exception of "ANDREY" ; . |

expressed. opinion of NOSENKO is consicered elsewhere in this summary

and analysts may differ as to whether a recruitment could have occurred

of which NOSENKO did not have knowledge, assuming that his statements

are made in good faith, It should be noted, however, that at this time

there is no specific information which is in direct conflict with the

expressed opinion of NOSENHO. : : J 7
NOSENKO, as previously mentioned, has never claimed any

particular knowledge of FCD activities, In addition, he does not claim

example, -he has made it clear that his knowledge of SCD activities
against members of delegations, foreign businessmen, foreign students, . .
and individuals in the USSR on the invitation of a Soviet organization or
a@ component of the Soviet Government is extremely limized and at best
mainly of a collateral nature.

NOSENKO does not even claim any detailed knowledge of

activities of the Second Section (Active Line) of the First Department, SCD,

nor does he claim to know all of the cases of which the Chief of the Seventh
Department was aware. The latter is.specifically supported by certain
notes brought out by NOSENKO which are short references to a number

of Seventh Department cases which are identified only by the KGB code
name, These notes, according to NOSENKO, were made when he had an
opportunity to review a notebook held by the Chief of the Seventh Department

and constitute the only knowledge NOSENKO had of these particular cases.

H._Is there any evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO in 1962
or in 1964 with CIA were known to the XGB prior to his defection or
that NOSENKO was ever briefed by the KGB relative to his behavior
or KGB objectives curing these contacts or aiter his defection? The
conclusion is that there is no evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO
in 1962 or in 1964 with CIA were shown to the KGB prior to his
defection and that NOSENKO was never briefed in any manner by the KGB.
The basis for the above conclusion is substantially contained in
_ Previous sections, It is being. treatec here as a separate area of interest
‘since it is a sufficiently important area as to warrant individual consideration.
It is recognized that since positive factual confirmation such as
the KGB file on NOSENXO is not available, any conclusion concerning

whether NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by the KGB can only be

based on the full review of available information from NOSENKO,
collateral sources, independent investigation and the opinion of the ©
individual analyst concerning the significance or non-significance of

‘.- ‘each item of available information.

The conclusion that the contacts of NOSENKO with CIA in 1962

re and 1964 prior to his defection were not known to the KGB is

go0i40?

ata untinte ne sternite donee o
14-00000

necessarily based in part on a judgment as to whether any of his
activities or information logically warrant a substantial suspicion
that they were or could be in any part the result of KGB direction

or control, One of the particular areas considered was his apparent

behavior during his contacts with CIA in June 1962 and the conclusion |

was that it was incomprehensible that he could have been under KGB

control at that time.

Consideration has been given to the possibility that his 1962

. contacts with CLA were not known to the KGB," but became known to

the KGB.Jater and NOSENKO was doubled by the KGB, It was con-

cluded ‘that there was no basis for or information which would warrant _
serious consideration of the above possibility aside from the separate
conclusion that the IGB would be very unlikely to reward a traitor in
KGB eyes by sending him again to Geneva where he would be quite free
to defect, : 7 a : : -

’ Worthy of comment in this section is the fact that NOSENKO,

‘during his 1962 contacts, expressed considerable concern over his

“personal security, requesting that knowledge concezning his identity be

“kept to an absolute minimum, that no communications be sent to the

PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS RE NOSENKO
AS CONTAINED ON PAGES 357 - 360 OF

"THE EXAMINATION OF THE BONA FIDES OF A KGB DEFECTOR"

The foliowing is a quote of the previous conclusions in the case of Yuriy

Ivanovich NOSENKO. (The specific conclusions have been given the designation

of A - G for purposes of easier correlation with other sections of this summary.)
"SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES"
"NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in

successively: senior positions of auhoriy from which he derived
extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and results of KGB
operations against Americans in the Soviet Union in the period
1953-1963. To substantiate his claim, he provides an impressive.
array of information about KGB personnel, organization and opera-
tions which, to the extent that it has been confirmed, is presumptive
evidence of his bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including
intelligence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's
claims. According to some of these sources, NOSENKO was a

- senior KGB officer who cecupied a series of sensiive. positions, who

oad

14-0000

enjoyed considerable autioniy and trust despite personal short-
comings, and whose defection, 'the greatest loss ever suffered
by Soviet Intelligence',. paralyzed the work of on KGB GREET ,
- Legal Residency, and justified the formulation of plans to assas~.
sinate him."
“The examination has cernpared each clement of NOSENKO's
biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known ©
facte and reasonable surmise. The examination reflects the
test to which his accounts were put: whether his accounte are
- internally coherent and consistent with known fact, and whether
., he actually gained the information he has from occupying the.
KGB.positions’he claims to have. held. In short, is he what he .
_ Says he is, according.to his own-accounts?"
“This examination hed led to the following findings, arrived
at independently:
A. NOSENKO Gid not serve in the Naval RU
in any of the capacities or at the places and times he

claimed,

\'B, NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the

‘manner or at the time he. claimed.

C. NOSENKO did not serve in the American.

E, NOSENKO wasn neither Deputy Chief of the

These findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of probability
‘or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance of available evidence
in each instance. "
“The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive evidence

of NOSENKO's bona fides. The contradictions in NOSENKO's accounts : *

of his. life and KGB service are 60 extensive as to make his claims |

oy as a whole unacceptabie. While truth and fact. in this case frequently

‘cannot de established with certainty, it is evident that truth and

fact are not what NOSENKO relates. By almost any test, virtually ae

any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned by iact or probability, -- i

er contradicted or retracted in his own statements. NOSENKO is

not what he claims to be, and thus he is not a bona fide defector."
"Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is not a bona fide ,

defector, it is necessary to attempt to determine his true motives

. in

for contacting American intelligence and for providing the information

- he has given. Here, it must be recognized that tne evidence, largely . oo .

consisting of NOSENKO's own assertions, does not permit unequivocal

conclusions. Neverteiess, the question cannot be ignored, The
character of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact that
some of his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet officials,

and the necessity to make decisions about NOSENKO's future all

require that at least a provisional judgment be made."
: "Of the reasonable explanations advanced ior NOSENKO's
misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a swindler posing

as a former KGB officer for reasons of personal advantage; that he

suffers from a deranged personality or unbalanced mind; that he has
~.,. greatly exaggerated his actual rank, status and access in the KGB, for - s

simply, personal reasons; or,. finally, , that he is a dispatched KGB 60041417

“The iirst two possibilities are easily dismissed, That

‘advantage to have been a KGB ofiicer is evident, we believe, irom

the confirmed details of KGB organization, personnel and operations

‘- KGB itself."
"Second, as noted inthe txt, extensive psychiatric and

Any

“ofa deranged personality or unbalanced mind." -

"It is somewhat more plausibie that NOSENKO is a KGB
‘officer who served in at least some of the components for some
Di , or all of the time periods that he claims, but who greatly exag-
: .. gerated his positions, rank and access to intormation, and
_ invented some matters outright, to achieve greater status with
: American Intelligence. This explanation, however, fails to
accommodate the fact that several KGB ofiicers have asserted

that: NOSENKO did in fact nold senior positions in the KGB. Also,

14-00000

"Because none of the above explanations is consistent with
the data developed in interrogations and investigations, we are
; left with the hypothesis that NOSENKO was dispatched by the
KGB. While this explanation does not reconcile all the anomalies,

none of them renders it untenable, "

"In the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or , . ,
other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that the
evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was dispatched
by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires that he be

regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and that his infor-

mation should be assessed accordingly." . :

A, NCSENKO did not serve in the Navai RU in any of the capacities

or at the places and times he claimed. (Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "A" in the previous summary in regard
to NOSENKO. The current conclusion is that the claimed servicé of oO a
NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence (Naval RU) during March 1951 to early
, 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas is adequately substantiated
and should be accepted.

The interrogations of NOSENKO prior to 1967 were complicated

by. NOSENKO changing the date of his graduation irom the Institute of
‘International Relations from 1950 to 1949. because he did not wish to
admit that he had failed to graduate in 1949. with the majority of hie class,
However, previous eZforts of NOSENKO to revert to his original 1962
statement that he graduated in 1950 were not accepted and an unwarranted —
significance was given to the 1949 - early 1953 period of time.
It is considered that NOSENKO has adequately explained his

“stupid. blunders" as they relate to the above and to certain other personal |

matters and that his claimed service in Navy Intelligence from March

acceptable, it is not considered necessary to comment concerning all
of the ‘remarks in the previous summary regarding the claimed Naval

RU service of NOSENKO as reflected on pages 49-59 and remarks will,

for purposes of brevity, be limited in scope,

The statement is made in the previous summary that "The sole

Colonel KALOSHIN, He identified no ranking officers in either the Baltic
or Far East Intelligence Staffs. Some 30 GRU officers he did identify,
by his own admission, NOSENKO knew not from his Naval RU service,

to.Geneva. "

NOSENKO at this time. The entire material included remarks by

NOSENKO had previously stated that his service in the Baltic

that the former name of the place, an almost deserted fisnermen's . . *

The previous summary aiso stated that despite his claimed

shouid be noted that there is a considerable difference between being

The above is conclusion "B" in the previous summary in regard |
te NOSENKO. The conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO entered

the then Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his

entry was not only facilitated by but due to the influence of General
Bogdan Zakharovich KC3ULOV.

Previous statements by NOSENKO and changes relative to date of
entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section of the summary
and will not be repeated here, His statements during current interviews
that he entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a case officer in the First
Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, are con-

sidered adequately substantiated and should be accepted,
j The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) that
NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed

“was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSENKO as to when .

he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in

1965 NOSENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.

in 1964, NOSENKO had given two dates in 1952 as his time of entry into
the KGB in an effort not to admit that he had: failed to graduate from the
Institute of International Relations in 1949,

The previous summary gave considerable weight to the statements
of NOSENKO indicating that he. did not enter the KGB (MVD) under what
are considered normal KGB procedures. ‘Proper allowances were not

given tor position of ‘the father of NOSENKO, the Minister of Shipbuilding,

oand the influence .of General KOBULOV: An analyst can either accept or

reject the statement of NOSENKO that he entered the KGB (MVD) through

. .the influence of.General KOBULOV;.but,. if the statement is accepted, ‘then
sthe failure. of NOSENKO to be required. to follow normal, KGB, procedures

organization is not and could not be immune to influence by a high official.

General KOBULOV as of mid-March 1953 was First t Deputy to 9 BERIYA,

the Minister of the then MVD.

The Previous summary raises several points concerning the

"etighbitity of NOSENKO for the KGB (MVD). It points out on page 67
‘that other than his undistinguished ‘period of service with the Naval RU,

whe was no more. eligible for a KGB. appointment in 1953 than he was at

ne time: of his previous rejection in 1950. This statement is not contro-

ve: tible and-is: fully accepted with the qualification that in 1950 NOSENKO

14-00000

“Was not sponsored by any person of influence as was the case in 1953
with General KOBULOV who in mid-March 1953 was the First Deputy
to BERIYA.

The previous summary also states that according to KGB ;
defectors familiar with the standards in force at the time, no candidate

was accepted who had ever had tuberculosis. This is a flat statement

‘which it is doubtiul any defector or series of defectors could fully ~
Te . nos tee

substantiate; r namely, that it never happened. Until and unless it is

medically Proven that NOSENKO did not have tuberculosis, itis accepted

that be did have tuberculosis in 1952 and was ata sanitarium eo. zest:

place in n Kubinka, Iti is also accepted that he wag an office

after mid-March 1953. The influence of XOBULOV could undoubtedly
have permitted NOSENKO to enter the KGB even though he previously

‘ had tuberculosis, but the flat statement that no candidate was accepted who
had ever had tuberculosis is not and cannot be sufiiciently substantiated.

The previous summary contained a number of additional remarks

: and conclusions intended to show that ‘NOSENKO was not eligible for and

therefore could not have entered the KGB (MVD). Comments concerning
: these will be brief since there is considered to be no adequate basis at
“this | time on which to contend that NOSENXO did not enter the KGB

RU dossier on NOSENXO was available to the KGB (MVD).

wo The previous summary also failed to note that the MVD would
have had independent information in regard to NOSENKO’since the MVD
would have conducted any necessary inquiry in connection with the entry
of NOSENKO into.the Naval RU. As of 1953, the MVD undoubtedly also

had a dossier on the father of NOSENKO since this was still the STALIN

The summary also states’ that NOSENKO did not complete the

necessary lengthy Anketa before entry into the KGB (MVD) and did not

seem that the influence of General KOBULOV could have permitted the

elimination of most if not all of the necessity of complying with normal -
procedures, but NOSENKO has during interviews stated that he com-

pleted the Anketa while sitting at his desk after entry into the KGB (MVD). -

Page 70 of the previous summary states that NOSENKO did not

entered on duty or during his first year of KGB service. While
NOSENKO has claimed that the designation of his Directorate at the
time he entered the KGB (MVD) in mid-March 1953 was the Second
Chief Directorate and that it subsequently was redesignated the

First Chief Directorate, DERYABIN has stated this reversal of
designations occurred in March 1953,

STALIN died in early Marca 1953 and that same month the

MVD and the MGB were merged under the name MVD with BERIYA

as Minister, BERIYA held this position until his arrest in early June
1955, BERIYA was succeeded by KRUGLOV, who held office for less
: than a year. Yuriy RASTVOROV, was recently queried concerning the
date of the reversal of the. designation of the FCD,and SCD and places
itas the end of April or early May 1953. GOLITSYN has indicated that
the change occurred "soon aftex the advent of BERIYA as head of the
MVD in April 1953." In the light of our inability to fix the effective Gate
of the reversal of the designations of the SCD and the FCD, it is
unreasonable to impugn NOSENKO on his statement as to the designation

the fact that he was a new junior officer and that this was a ‘period of

upheaval in the KGB (MVD) effectively eliminates any significance in

this issue. .

NOSENXO is criticized in the previous summary for not knowing
the location of the Chief Directorate of the Militia or the history of the
KI (Committee of Information). NOSENKO has stated that he had no
contacts with either office during 1953-1955 and there is no adequate reason ; ° ; GS :
to disbelieve this. statement. He is not aware of when the XI ceased to
exist (1951 given in the summary, but other information indicates the KI
continued to exist in a nominal capacity until the mid-1950's)}, but care
should be used in stating what NOSENKO should know if he held a certain
position. Readers of this summary may wish to reflect on their own .
memory concerning the location and their knowledge of Agency facilities at

any given period of time or when Agency components or related organizations

were organized or ceased to exist. . .

The point has also been made that any career of NOSENKO
in the KGB should have ended or he should have at least encountered
difficulty when his benefactor General KOBULOV, together with the
brother of General XOBULOV, was arrested with the BERIYA group in

“ early June 1953. NOSENKO has during current interviews stated that he

encountered no difficulties but is aware that the KOBULOV connection

was discussed.by an officer from the Personnél Directory with an .. : : ve : i ;

would very possibly have encountered difficulty; but, it shouldbe noted : os

that the father of NOSENKO retained his position, that. NOSENKO only. - de

met General KOBULOV through his father, and that NOSENKO has. stated
that although his father knew General KOBULOV, his father could in no

ws

throug hout the 1953 - 1955 period as ne claimed, (Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "C'" in the previous summary. The
conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO was an officer of the First
Section (American Embassy Section), First Department, from mid-March
1953 to late May 1955 when he was transferred to the Seventh Department,
ScD,

This period of time has been covered in detail with NOSENKO

‘during ‘current interviews, The conclusion is that NOSENKO was an
ofiicer in the First Section but was not a very effective officer and that
both his work and behavior were decidedly influenced by the fact that he
was the son of the Minister of Shipbuilding. NOSENKO is reluctant to
admit that he was other than slightly lackadaisical in his work curing
this period of time, but is not hesitant to admit that his personal be~
havior was such as to cause him to be removed as Secretary to the

Komsomol unit in 1954 and to cause an unsatisfactory "characterization"

to be prepared in early 1955 which necessitated a decision as to whether

he would be fired from the KGB or transierred to some other component.

The influence of his family is quite apparent in the above since

- his father was advised of his difficulties in 1954 by an official of the
KGB and his mother interceded on his behalf in 1955 with the Caief of

SCD. The result in 1955 was that NOSENKO was transferred to the

Seventh Department and not fired from the KGB.

The question has been raised as to how NOSENKO could remain

on

in the KGB when after 1954 he was not a member of the Komsomol and

“ a

+) Was not eligible to become a candidate for the Communist Party. This

is.a valid question but a plausible explanation is again the fact that he was ; tee 2

the son of the then Minister of Shipbuilding.
NOSENKO has stated curing previous and current interviews that

following his entry into the KGB and until circa mid-1954 he was respon-

sible for work against American correspondents in Moscow. He has not

claimed that he had any successes and has stated that the work with news-
paper correspondents already recruited was being handled by other officers.

NOSENKO has explained that during this time he was a "new officer,"

indicating he could hardly have been expected to act as an experienced -

officer.. His knowledge of correspondents in Moscow during this period -

: information concerning his own agents is believed of sufficient weight

; to accept the statement of NOSENKO that work against American cor-
xespondents was his assignment from mid-March 1953 to mid-1954,

From circa mid-1954 until his transier to the Seventh Depart-

ment in late May 1955, NOSENKO ciaims and has claimed be was an
officer of the First Section with the responsibility of work against the
Military‘Attaches (Army) at the United States Embassy in Moscow. It
is considered, based on his knowledge of the various Military Attache

personnel and other collateral information furnished by NOSENXO, that

NOSENKO was an officer. of the First Section during the mid-1954 - late

May 1955. period of time, that his primary work was against members

of the Office of the Military Attache, but that the quality of his work

undoubtedly left much to be desired.

In circa mid-1954, NOSENKO was removed as Secretary of the

Komsomol unit and by early 1955 bis performance was such thatatleast a
certain officials in the First Department desired his removal from the

. eo
First Department, if not the KGB. Under these circumstances,

NOSENKO could be criticized as having been a very poor if net
undesirable KGB officer, but his knowledge of the First Section during

this period of time and his knowledge of the members of the Office of

the Military Attache supports the claira of NOSENKXO that he was an
officer oi the F.rs? Section with the indicated assignment ab related
by aim.

NOSENXO has stated that the work against the Military ‘
Attaches was not primarily directed toward development oi recruitment
possibilities, but was directed toward control of the Military Attaches
on trips in order to prevent observation of sensitive areas, sensitive
sites or sensitive activities in the USSR. This attitude by the KGB
would appear to be compietely plausible and NOSENKO noted as
exceptionzi in this regard the recruitment attempt against Captain Waiter
MULE. NOSENKO explained this exception as retaliation for approaches
to Soviets in the United States in that period,

NOSENKO has been criticized because he did not know all the
details concerning the Military Attaches which it was considered he
should have known if he had the specific responsibility for work against
the Military Atcaches during the indicated period of time. it is submitted

that this may be evidence o: his failure to satisiactorily fulfill his

Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section, Sevenin

NOSENKO has furnished information on the travel of certain
United States Government oiiiciais, including Congressional represent-
atives to the USSR in 1955 - 1956; and the trip of Supreme Court Justice
1
William O, DOUGLAS in 1955 which, when consiuered with the previously
\
mentioned specifics, adequately substantiate his -simed service in the
Seventh Department and work against American-B ritish Commonwealth
tourists during the late May 1955 - December 1959 period.
NOSENKO has stressed that when he transferred to the Seventh
Department, the Tourist Section had just been established and an agent ,
network was not .vailable for operations against American and British
tourists, This seems quite logical since the infiux of tourists into the
USSR was jut in,a jormative stage.
NOSENKO has spoken in detail about an agent network he de-
veloped after 1955 which primarily consisted of Intourist personnel
and two homosexual agents, "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" (KGB code
names), whose extensive use in KGB operations has been confirmed by
interviews with individuals who were the subject of homosexual] com-
promise operations.
The previous summary contained remarks on pages 101 - 150 a
in regard'to the claimed 1955 - 1959 Seventh Department service of

Og1150

NOSENKO. To comment on all the aspects mentioned in those fifty

ved

14-0000

pages would be repetitious and in many instances superiiuous, Ii is
considered that even ii the statements were accepted in toto, there
would stili not be an aGequate basis ior 4 conclusion that NOSENKO
was not an ofiicer in the claimed positions in tne Seventa Department
during the period of late May 1955 - December 1959, Nor is it con-
ceded that, if all the subd-conclusions and the interpretations oi various
areas of information were accepted without quaiification, there is any
evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, "However, there
are certain assumptions and interpretations which appeared in the
previous summary which are particularly worthy of comment and which
are considered erroneous or require additional clarification,

On page 145 it is stated that the evidence suggests that NOSENKO
was an English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a counter-
intelligence officer responsible for the identification of foreign agents
among tourists or for the development, recruitment, and exploitation
of agents for the KGB. The Second Chief Directorate, KGB, and the
MVD have used homosexual and heterosexual compromise in numerous
known (and presumably unknown) successful recruitments and recruit-
ment attempts. This activity has not been limited to the Seventh Depart-

ment, SCD; and the innuendo that NOSENKO was "only an English-

speaking specialist in sexual entrapment" and not ‘a KGB geedwten

considered with the cetaiicd information NOSENKO has proviéed on

Seventh Departrnent personnel, activities, procedures, and topice of

a similar nature is not considered to have any foundation in fact.
Page 145 of the above surnmary lists eleven operations which

were Seventh Department cases prior to 1960 and which were included

in the notes furnished to CIA in 1964 by NOSENKO, The named operations

were those againsi{ Bernard PECHTER, Patrick PRESSMAN, John RUFE, Ob 06, bby Ob, 04, 06, Db

Gerald SEVERN, Sofia SHATTAUER, (inu) KARLOV, Norman FISK,
Ralph MATLAW Marvin KANTOR{ Michael GINSBURG, and William ob 06
TARASKA, The criticism made in regard to the above eleven cases
was that NOSENKO could not describe the individual operations other
than to say that he had recorded the name of the target and such details
as he could acquire when he reviewed the activities of the Seventh Depart-
ment in 1962 foliowing his return from the First Department.

The notes brought out by NOSENXO ave considered in another
section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a fuil review

. o

of all of the notes of NOSENKO currently available indicates that his
statements as to how and why he obtained the information in the notes
are completely piausible. A detailed explanation of the notes furnished
by NOSENKO would almost. necessitate a separate listing of the approxi-

mately 150 cases or names mentioned in the notes,

it shouid aiso be noted that certain of the cases suchas Marvin KANTOR.
and Fritiam TpRasiy] were cases in which the tourist was visiting
§ -

relatives in the Soviet Union and that NOSENKO has given a satisiactory

expianation of how he iearned of the KANTOR case. NOSENKO has, in

' discussing his duties as Deputy Chief of the American~British Common-

wealth Section, aiso explained that if a tourist indicated that he intended

to visit relatives in tne USS“, the case automatically was assigned toa

group of officers in the Section who reported directiy to the Chief of

Section and were, not under the supervision of NOSENKO.
NOSENKO has stated that he noted the names of three of the
individuals when retiring the files of "GRIGORIY" and "SHMELEV,"
two homosexual agents of NOSENKO previously mentioned. NOSENKO
has explained that "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" had the assignment of
identifying American travelers with homosexual tendencies, that they
had contact with numerous Americans, and that they“had homosexual

activity with individuals on whom they reported but on whom no overt

action was taken by the Seventh Department. In some cases the individual

the notes which NOSENKO brought out in 1964 have been discussed in
detail with NOSENKO, He has given a detailed explanation of the material
which he brought out and his explanation of all aspects is very convincing.
The previous summary (page 144) suggested that the involvement
of NOSENKO in certain cases being handled by other Sections in the
Seventh Department or by the KGB Directorate of Moscow was unusual,
An examination of the cited cases does not indicate that his participation
was unusual, but rather that his explanation of why he was involved is
logical and normal. No consideration was previously given to the English
language capability of NOSENKO or the fact that his own homosexual agents
were used in two of the four cited cases.

This question seems quite superfiucus sincefi

Vicual traveling in tie USSR is decided on the basis of how the individual

as the invitee of an organization in the USSR, as a iormer diplomat :

which affect the determination of which Department or organizational
component of the SCD has the responsibility for a tourist case. These
factors include whether the individual is already suspected of foreign
intelligence connections and whether the individual is a businessman,
In addition, certain actual tourists in the USSR may never become the
responsibility of the SCD if the individual is of specific interest to the
FCD.

: On pages 148 - 149, NOSENKO is criticized for not knowing at
least some of the substance of the information furnished by George
BLAKE in regard to the CIA-MI-6 program of utilizing tourist agents
inthe USSR. This criticism completely ignored the fact that NOSENKO

made severai references in 1962 to the KGB having such information

although he dic then and stiil suspects that William VASSALL was the
source, The references py NCSENKO to the KGB having such inior-
mation were not developed in 1962 or later interrogations, and it was

not until current interviews inet it was estabiisned that NOSENZO had

‘actually seen excerpts of information passe” by George BLAKE.

According to NOSENKO, the information which was obviously only
partial was furnished to the FCD by the SCD and could oniy have come

from an agent,

The previous summary (page 149) also notes that in 1961 CIA

acquired a lengthy Top Secret study on the subject of the use of tourists

by American Intelligence for espionage and operational support in the

Soviet Union (document was iurnished by GOLITSYN following his de-
fection in December 1961). it was noted that the summary contained
references to certain 1958 - 1959 tourists whom the KGB counter-
’ intelligence identified as American agents and noted that NOSENKO
claimed he was Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth
Section in this period of time and that he claimed the KGB icentified
no American Intelligence agenis during this period of time. What later
‘ is described as a claim by NOSENKO is neither an accurate refiection
of what NOSENKO said prior to 1967 or has said since 1967.

NOSENKO ias never claimed to kiiow all activities against
American traveiers in the Soviet Union curing 1958 -1959. Many
of these travelers would have been the responsibility of a section in
the Seventh Departnent, other than the American-Britisn Commen-
weaith Section, or another Depariment in ihe SCD, NOSENKO was
quite aware that certain of the American tourists in 1958 - 1959 were
actit.g suspiciously from a KGB point of view,

NOSENKO has stated he was aware thata document which the
Seventh Department had prepared and iurnished to the FCD in an efiort
to obtain further assistance from the FCD in the work against tourists
had been compromised by GOLITSYN, NOSENKO stated he was not in
the Seventh Department when the document was prepared and did not
review the document wntil after the defection of GOLITSYN and foiiow-
ing advice from the FCD to the Seventh Department, scp, that the
document had been compromised, The document furnished by GOLITSYN
has never been reviewed with NOSENKO to determine if it contained
additional information not in the document which he waa aware had '
been prepared by the Seventh Department for the FCD.

NOSENKO has been impugned on his apparent unfamiliarity with

a number of cases cited as examples in the document furnished by

GOLITSYN. In current interviews, however, the descriptiqn i MS ENKO

It is also apparent that the philosophy in the KGB was to maintain

a single handler-agent relationship 23 much as possible, and that respon-

had access to a target who was the responsibility of a case oificer other

than the handler of the agent, This apparent philosophy is of particular

The matter of review by NCSENKO of OTU veports izom ricro-

i mentioned in this summary. Pases 226 - 235 of the previous suramary

contained a ceiailed account of informacvion irom NOSENKO on the mitier

of microphones, countermeasures taken by the Americans in 1964

i Gamage estimates prepared by the Americans. The . previous conclusion

was that his information cid not sustain hi 4m to have been Deputy

microphone monitoring reports. Comments have been mace in this

summary in regard to this previous conclusion,

. A few remarks, it is believed, will cessist in a fuller understa>

of the microphone matter. In the material brought out by NOSENKOx..

1964, there was a single sheet per containing on one side hand-

written notes which NOSENKXO identiiied as a list of the active micro- -
phones (those which were being rnonitored) in the United States Embassy
This list is given on page 227 of the previous summary and need not be

. repeated here, The acquisition of this list by NOSENKO was character-

not as meaning just a micropaone, but as referring to an OTU sub-unit

which includes microphones as weli as the necessary monitors and

translators to cover the microphone and translate the "take." The

targets of PETROV were primarily Americans anc, therefore, there

was a transcription-translation probiem.

According to NOSENKO, most oz the available "points" were

that the KGB had reasons to consider the activities of

It ip not balieved that the ated failures of NOSENKO to identify
CIA officers are of particular significance tn establiching tuat be was

known factors wuich would need to be cousidered. Despite our ascump-
tions as to what the KGS knows, It (a possible that (a) the KGB did not

te the KGB was not available at the First Section, Tirst Department,
lewel, of (c) information available to the Chief of the First Section or
to a specific tase officer waa of no offictal concern to NOSENKO and
was not made available to him. The last of these possibilities is
suggested in spite of claims by NOSINKO that he had to have known
whatover was known in the Section regarding CIA identifications; a
propencity on the part of NOSENKO to exaggerate the area of hia own
hnowledgeability hso been ceen elecwhere in this case.

Pages 252 - 258 of the previous summary contsia a report of
the 1960 trip of NOSENKO to Cuba and his 1961 trip to Bulgaria. With
regard to the Cuba trip, there Is collateral evidence of his traval as

Re

SECRET

F, NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the
American-British Commonweaith Section and was thereafter a

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible. (Previous

conclusion)

The conclusion of this summary is that NOSENKO was Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section (First Section) from

January 1962 to July 1962 and that he was.a Deputy Chief of the Seventh

- Department thereafter. |

. NOSENKO has. stated that, although he was offered the position
of a Deputy Chief of the First Department, SCD, by Oleg M. CRIBANOV,
Chief, SCD, and although an order had been prepared and was in the
Personnel Directorate, he declined the proffered position.
According to NOSENKO, he knew that Sergey Mikhaylovich
FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the First Department, did not want NOSENKO
as a Deputy Chief, but instead wanted to promote Vladislav KOVSHUK,

then Chief of the First Section, to the position. FEDOSEYEV was

CC01218-

14-0000

i
i

willing to promote NOSENKO to the position of Chief, First Section.
However, GRIBANOV cid not wish to promote KOVSHUK and NOSENKO
considered that under the circumstances it would be better for him to
return to the Seventh Department rather than to become a Deputy to
FEDOSEYEV who wanted KOVSrUKas a Deputy.

Vladimir Dmitriyevich CHELNOKOV had offered NOSENKO the
position of Chief.of the First Section, Seventh Department, pending the
reassignment of BALDIN to Germany at which time NOSENKO would
become a Depity Chief, Seventh Department, replacing BALDIN. The
above explanation of NOSENKO.seems plausible and credible and indi-
cates that GRIBANOV, the Chief of the SCD, for reasons best known to —
GRIBANOV, was assisting NOSENKO in his career in the KGB.

This ‘section actually covers two periods in the claimed career
of NOSENKO; namely, January - July 1962 as Chief of the First Section,
and July 1962 - January 1964 as a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Depart-
ment, Since NOSENKO wae in Geneva, Switzerland, from March to
June 1962, he actually cannot be seriously faulted for not having de- :
tailed knowledge of the activities of the First Section during January -
July 1962, The previous summary (pages 268 ~ 291) contains remarks
in regard to the January - July 1962 period, including the period of

March ~ June 1962 when he was in Geneva, Four specific tourist cases

the Seventh Department was not concerned wita joreigners visiting
relatives in the USSR nor with Soviet expatriates. NOSENKO, accord-
ing to the previous summary, was aware sna BaAEnSoas a former
Soviet citizen and the summary stated that his plan to visit relatives
was information available to the KGB tsrough his visa application,
In regard to the statement that the Seventh Department was not
concerned with foreigners visiting relatives in the USSR nor with Soviet
~ expatriates, this is not in agreement with current information from
NOSENKO, * Cases of "true*' tourists, which were normally the respon-
i sibility of the Seventh Department, could become the responsibility, of
another department or KGB component where Soviet relatives were
involved. However, if the case was not taken over or assigned by higher
authority to another department or component, it was and xemained the
responsibility of the Seventh Department, The fact maf BRACRSywas a -
former Soviet citizen could very well have nade BAS ot interest to
the Second Section, First Department, or a direction in the Service of

authority, the case. would remain the responsibility of the Seventh Departe
ment sinc{ BRAUNS)was visiting the Soviet Union on a tourist visa. The

relative or relatives in Leningrad, sonovafince when interviewed by
the FBI, mentioned a number of items oi which the KGB was aware concern-
ing his background and occupation from his visa application, there is no
specific reference in these interviews indicating his statement of purpose
in visiting the USSR.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary revitws remarks by
NOSENKO on the Boris BELITSKIY case and states that his claimed role
in the case was not plausible, There are several s:ccific points made in
the summary which imply that NOSENKO was lying about his knowledge of
the case, Taere is adequate reason to believe that NOSENKO exaggerated
his own 1962 role.in that NOSENKO now states he was to give assistance
to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV in the handling of BELITSKIY in Geneva
in 1962 and not to supervise ARTEMOV,

The more important aspect and the primary one is the difference in
what NOSENKO specifically reported about the BELITSKIY case and infor-

mation from the actual CIA record of the case, There are major difier-

1
ences and without going into all the details of the case which is very involved,

‘an effort has been made toward determining whether these apparent differ-

ences necessarily indicate that NOSENKO was or is lying or whether there
is a possibility he is relating the actual KGB version of the case.
* NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY was a KGB agent whom

American Intelligence recruited in London in 1960 or 1961 and that the

. , 0001223

SECR aT

14-0000

KGB purpose in running the operation was to-lure American Intelligence
into meeting BELITSKIY insice the USSR. The previous summary ‘stated
that NOSENKO did not know when the BELITSKI. operation started
(Brussels, Belgium, 1958), did not know the nature of the British
involvement, did n:t know the operational details and contact arrange~
ments BELITSKIY had with CIA, and did not know BELITSKIY's pattern
of activity in Moscow or Geneva.

NOSENKO during current interviews has indicatéd an awareness
that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use
BELITSKIY against the British. However, he still has dated the recruit-
ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in Loadon and still states that the
primary purpose of the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in
contacts with BELITSKIY within the USSR, The latter was considered
completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSKIY was recruited in
Brussels, Belgium, in 1958; that three letters had been mailed to
BELITSKTY in the USSR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY
had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR.
| : There are at this time sufficient unresolved questions in the

BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis=

crepancies between the statements by NOSENO on the BELITSKIY

the other hand, there is some reason to believe NOSENKO has
furnished the actual KGB version of the BELITSKIY case and that the
KGB, at least as of 1962, did not know the true story of tne relation-

ship of BELITSKIY with CIA, There is a distinct possibility the

KGB believed the BELITSKIY recruitment occurred in 1961 in London
and BELITSKIY did not then nor has he since admitted to the KGB
‘his association with CIA actually started in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium. |
As a possible reason why BELITSKIY would have told the KGB in
1961 a partial story of his contact with American Intelligence, some:
at present unknown event may have occurred in 1961 which caused
BELITSKIY to believe his security was endangered and as a result
he told the KGB of certain events in London in 1961, relating these
events as being the original approach to BELITSKIY by CIA.
The following are certain of the points which suggest the KGB
actually considered that BELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in London
ra ‘
in 1961 and that BELITSKIY may have never told the KGB of the
developments in his case prioz to 196];
. (a) BELITSKIY was in London in April 1960 at which |
time he was in contact with a British citizen who was also" a
reporting to MI-5, This individual reported information

received from BELITSKIY which may have been a lead to

6001225

SECRET

14-00000

George BLAXE, (It seems highly untikely the KGB would

ever have directed BELITSKIY to furnish information which

may have been a lead to George BLAKE, or at least could

have caused the employees of the unit in which BLAKE was

employed from June 1959 to August 1950 to come under -

suspicion as having passed information to Soviet Intelligence. )
(b) NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY, aiter he went

to Geneva in 1962, managed to reinitiate contact with CIA

rather quickly because he met a girl he had previously known

whom he was sure was an American Intelligence agent and

that she must have reported his presence in Geneva to American

Intelligence, (If the BELITSKIY case had been controlled by the

KGB from its inception in 1958, the KGB would have known of

the internal mailings to BELITSKIY and the fact that BELITSKIY

had a cover address outside the Soviet Union through which to \

initiate contact. However, if BELITSKXIY did not tell the KGB

anything about his contacts with CIA prior to 1961 and-then

gave only a partial story of what happened in London in 1961,

BELITSKIY would not have told the KGB of the internal mail~ ;

ings to BELITSKIY in the USSR or the fact that he long had

a cover address outside the USSR. BELITSKIY therefore

As previously indicated, the conclusion is there are a sufficient
number of unresoived questions in the BELITSKIY case so that discrep- .
ancies between information fom NOSENKO and the actual record in the
BELITSKIY case cannot at present be considered as a reilection against
NOSENKO, and there is a distinct possibility the KGB actually did not
know the true facts of the BELITSKIY case.

The previous summary noted on page 106 that Nataliya SHULGINA
was an Intourist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO in 1955, It also
noted that NOSENKO had stated Boris BELITSKIY "reported to the KGB

. that CIA had warned BELITSKIY against SHULGINA," The previous
summary stated BELITSKIY reported to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB
agent and "CIA did not warn BELITSKIY,"

There appears to be no doubt at this time that the statement by
NOSENKO that BELITSKIY reported the "CIA had warned BELITSKIY
against SHULGINA," is a reasonably accurate description of what actualy
happened in May 1962 during Agency contacts with BELITSXIY in Geneva,
The record reflects that BELITSKIY stated SHULGINA had confidentially
told him of her status as a KGB agent, stating she had been doubled by 4
the KGB after having been forcibly recruited by American Intelligence
whik previously in Paris, France.

it was determined there was no collateral jnformation which
would indicate that the statement by SIIULGINA had any factual basis
: and BELITSKIY was warned SHULGINA may have been acting on behaif
of-the KGB in stating to BELITSKIY she had been "forcibly recruited by
American Intelligence" at a previous date. It was also suggested to
BELITSXIY that he should go to the KGB as a loyal Soviet citizen and
report the apparent indiscretion of SHULGLA,
Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary, in connection with
the BELITSKIY case, made reference to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV.
It was stated that ARTEMOV had been involved with a series of America:
tourist agents in the Soviet Union and although NOSENKO was allegedly
familiar with ARTEMOV, he was unaware of the involvement of ARTEMOV
with American tourist agents in 1958 ~ 1959, The summary noted this
was during a period when NOSENKO claimed to have been Deputy Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section of tne Seventh Depart-
ment, Although not specifically stated, the above suggested ARTEMOV
was actually in the Seventh Department in 1958 ~ 1959 and that NOSENKO
was not even aware ARTEMOV was in the Seventh Department. NOSENKO
has consistently stated that ARTEMOV was assigned to the First Section,
First Department, from the time he entered into the KGB in approxi
mately 1957, .

A closer examination of the cases described in the previous
summary as "CiA American tourist agents," reveals there is no con-
flict in the invoivement of ARTEMOV in these cases and the statement
by NOSENKO that ARTEMOV was with the First Section, First Depart- :
ment, As an example, one of the cases is the case of} Edward MeGOWAN} Ob
NOSENKO has furnished information concerning this case, stating it was
originally a Seventh Department case and that after the mailing of a letter '
by the individual in Minsk, the case was immediately taken over by the
First Department, There is adequate reason to believe ARTEMOV only
became involved after the case was transferred to the First Department,
Another of the cases involved the contact of ARTEMOV withla CIA O%,24, 4-1
officer who was under Department of State cover in Helsinki, Finland,
and visited the USSR on a teurist visa. Such an individuai would under
no circumstances be considered a true tourist or the responsibility of
the Seventh Department, particulariy since apparently the individual was —
even traveling under a diplomatic passport, it is,assumed the individual
\ :
was oi interest to the First Chief Directorate and if the Fiist Chief
Directorate required or desired support from the SCD, it would normally
request the First Department for such assistance and it is extremely un-

likely that the FCD would request the Seventh Department for assistance

ina case involving an American diplomat,

Pages 332 - 333 of the previous summary contain the basis
for the previous conclusion that the claim of NOSENKO that he wasa ..
Deputy Chief of the Seventa Department from July 1962 to January
1963 was not credible. It is considered that a detailed rebuttal is
not necessary since this conclusion was apparently based on inadequate
information, During current interviews, NOSENKO has furnished
details concerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position
which substantiate his claim to having been a Deputy Chief of the
Seventh Department from July 1962 to January 1964,

An example in support of the statement that the previous conclu-
sion was based on inadequate information is the matter of the written
notes which NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 1964...
The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is
inadequate, inaccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews,
an effort had not been made to obtain from NOSENKO a detailed explan=
ation of his notes or of how he obtained the information in the notes.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed informa-
tion concerning ail aspects of his notes. This information supports his
claimed position of Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and includes

collateral support to his claim of being Deputy Chief of the First Section,

First.Department, in 1960-1961, — : 6001231

14-0000

Wea

Primarily the notes of NOSENKO can be categorized as

follows:

- (a) Snort case summaries by the Chiefs of the

First Section, Second Section ena Sixth Section, Seventa

i Department. NOSENKO has stated that he was in 1962 -
1963 responsibie for supervision over these Sections and
that Filip Denisovich BOBKOV,. Deputy Chief, SCD, who
supervised the Seventh Department, requested a list of all
recruited agents of the Seventh Department, According to
NOSENKO, the order from BOSKOV was to only retain the
files (cases) of agents in tourist firms and that the files of
other recruited agents should be sent to the FCD or Archives.
NOSENKO has stated that he in turn levied on the Chiefs of
the three Sections the requirement of BOBKOV, but also ex~
panded the request to include ail 19600 - 1962 cases, not
excluding previous cases or cases which had already been
given to the FCD. ‘The notes of NOSENKO included hand-
written reports from the Chief or Acting Chief of each Section
on recruited agents, with information varying from agent to
agent and even including some human errors.

Many of the above cases had previously ‘been trans-

inclusion ‘support his statement that he had expanded
the original request from BOBKOV so that he would have
some "pieces of information to give CIA,"

{b) Notes by NOSENKO on other cases which he learned
of. during the 1962 - 1963 period. Certain of the notes were
made from a review of a notebook kept by the Chief, Seventh
Department, to which NOSENKO had access on at least two

occasions. Most of his notes were not detailed but were

sufficient to refresh the memory of NOSENKO at a later

date and yet were somewhat innocuous to maintain before
his defection.

(c) Notes for lectures to officers of the Seventh Directorate
prepared while with the First Department, 1960'- 1961, and
the Seventh Department, 1962 - 1363,

{d) Drait report ior the briefing of the new Chief, First
Department, in the latter part of 1961, .

(e) One of three copies of an unregistered report pre-
pared by the Chief, Seventh Department, and two Deputy Chiefs,
including NOSENKO. This was a briefing paper for use by the’
Chief (CHELNOKOV) in an appearance before the Collegium

of the KGB which was reviewing the activities of the Seventh

Department. According to NOSENKO, the prepared

report was never typed as a forrnal Gocurnent,

The view has been set forth that NOSENKO took undue risk in
carrying written notes with him out of the Soviet Union. An examination
of this material suggests -aat NOSENKO was using extrerne care in
collecting material and was not attempting to obtain documents, the
possession of which might be incriminating or which if he had brought
out would have been immediately missed. Instead, he collected a con-
siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with
little or no fear that a search of his effects in the KGB after his depart-
ure for Geneva would disclose that certain niaterial was missing. None
of the material was registered and all could have previously been des-
troyed by NOSENKO,

The previous summary stated that NOSENKO brought three. KGB
documents to Geneva. These were typed papers but none was registered : i
or actually accountable, The reference to three documents was to:

a) The draft report for the briefing of the Collegium
which has been mentioned previously.

G,_NOSENKO ::7s no valid claim to certainty that the KGB
recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and his

defection in 1964. (Previous conclusion) , ; . |
The conclusion in tuis summary is that NOSENKO is of the
opinion that there were no KGB recruitments of United States Embassy
personnel in Moscow between 1953 and December 1963 with the exception
of "ANDREY" (Dayle Wallis SMITH) and iervest i HOWARD) who actually
was a(n) employee but did work part of the time in the Embassy.
The question here is whether or not the expressed opinion of
NOSENKO is suificiently based on actual knowledge so that this opinion
‘ can be accepted as absolute evidence that there were no other KGB
recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time. -The
only logical conclusion is that the opinion of NOSENKO cannot be
accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, there is a possibility that’:
a recruitment could have occurred and NOSENKO not be aware in any
way of the recruitment, This should in no way be interpreted as a
suggestion that NOSENKO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased
observer without personal knowledge could and should be hesitant to
accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO in this particular area.
4 ) “The actual basis for the stated opinion of > NOSENER, tse’ be

examined and can be cited as follows. ; . ‘

eter ee el ae tone

14-0000

Pee Gee ome ge mete ype mee

‘ (a) During Marca 1953-late May 1955 NOSENKO
was a caSe Oificer in the First Section, First Department,
SCD. NOSENKO does not claim that he would have known
the details concerning any recruitments (other than
"ANDREY") in this period, but states if there had been
se would have heard "something."

(b) During late May 1955 to December 1959 NOSENKO
was in tae Seventh Department, not the First Department,
but continued to have contact with certain officers in the
First Section, First Department, NOSENKO is of the
opinion that if there had been a recruitment in the United
States Embassy during this period he would have heard
"something" even though he would probably have learned .
few details.

(c) During the January 1960-December 1981 period
NOSENKO was Deputy Chie of the First Section, First
Department, and he has made the categorical statement
that there were no recruitments by the KGB of United
States Embassy personnel during this period of time.

He has also stated that if there had been any recruitments
during the 1953-1959 period he is sure he would, during
1960-1961, have heard or learned some details of B)04238

case or cases. There is merit to this contention by

14-0000

os

Pond

. of United States Embassy personnel. NOSENKO pointed

NOSENKO since the Chief of Section was Vladislav
KOVSHUK who had been an officer of the First Depart-
ment since 1953, actually working in the First Section
except for the periods of time that he was in the United
States to reactivate "ANDREY" in 1957-1958 and a Tos
period of time that he was Deputy Chief of the First
Department, : :

{d) During 1962-1903 NOSENKO was again in the
Seventh Department. However, he continued to maintain
contact with certain officers of the First Section, First
Department; in particular, Gennadiy I. GRYAZNOV,
who succeeded NOSENKO as Deputy Chief of the First
Section, then became Chief of Section, and in the latter
part of 1963 became a Deputy Chief of the First Department,

According to NOSENKO his relationship with

GRYAZNOV was sufficiently close during 1962-1963 that
he is sure GRYAZNOV would have furnished NOSENKO

some information in regard to any successful recruitments

. 96
out that he learned of the existence of the [Hexbert HOWARD]

case from GRYAZNOV in 1962, although it was not until

1963 that NOSENKO heard the name, NOSENKO actually

0001239
14-0000

learned of the name when the First Section, First
Department, needed the services of the Seventh

_ Department (Third Section) in obtaining a room ina

certain hotel for the Soviet girl friend offfiowAnd}

“In genaral the above constitutes the dasis for the stated opinion
of NOSENKO that "ANDREY" and|Herbert AOWARBYwere the only
successful KGB recruitmente during 1953 - December 1963. It should
be noted that there are no other identified KGB recruitments during
this period of time which would specifically refute the opinion of
NOSENKO. However, in view of the cited actual basis for the opinion
of NOSENKO, acceptance of the opinion of NOSENKO as being an
honest opinion should not be converted into a statement that it is
absolute proof that another recruitment could not have occurred.
NOSENKO may be completely correct in his opinion, but since
NOSENKO was only in the First Department 1953 - 1955 and 1960 - 1961
his opinion that he wovld have heard "something" about a recruitment

in 1955 - 1959 or 1962 + 1963 Sannot be accepted as infallible.
