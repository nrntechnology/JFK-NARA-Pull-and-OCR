MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT: CIA Reorganization

! gubmit the following viewa ag one whe worked in OSS during the
war and served as o poriadic CLA consultant in the years gince.

Qn balance, CIA's record hao probebly been very goad. In the
nature of clandeatine operations, the triumphe of an intelligence
agency are unknown®; all the public heare dhout (or should hear
about) are its errore. But, again tn the nature of the case, an
agency dedicated to clandestine activity can afford damnad few
vigible errors. The important thing te recognize today, in my
judgment, {6 that the C1A, as at present named end constituted, has
about used up ite quote. Ite margin for future error is practically

mon-exietent. Gace more CIA debacle will shake faith considerably

in US policy, s¢ home ae well as abroad. And, until CIA is vieibly
reorganized, it will (ae in the Algerian inatance} be widely blamed for
@evalopmente of which it ie wholly insocent.

Fhe argument of thi¢ memorandum to that CIA's trauble can be traced

to the autonomy with which the agency has heen parmitted te operates
and that thid autonomy fe due to three main causes: {1) dn inadequate
Gactrine of clandestine oporations; (2} an inadequate conception of
the relationship between operations and policy; (3} an Anadaquate

I Doctrine

Though GIA's autonomy developed fer histerical reseons, it has been
able to endure becauge there io no doctrine governing our donduct of
clandestine operations, The preblem of doctrine for CIA ta the extent
to which ite various clandestine missions are compatibie with a free
and open society.

Bt is idle to argue that, beesuse thé Communtste can do such-saé-quch,
we are free to de it tes. Communiom te a creed nurtured in cone
gplracy! and the whale point of Gamnvuntst eociel and polistaal ergeni=
gation i¢ to make conepizacy effective. I ‘fighting fire with fire’ means
contracting the freedome traditionally enjoyed by Americans in order
te give more freedom to CIA, no one séricualy wiehes to do that. Yet
£ do not feel thet wo have tried rigorously to think through the limits
which the maintenance of an open cactety places on accret activity.
Untit thie te done, CIA's rote will uct be clcgrly defined and under-

gétivity te constctent with the preservation of & free aocial order?

GIA personnel wae guppoged to be atrictly limited and temporary.

The Dullee-Correa-Jackgon report étated tn 1948, “The CIA shauid
not use State Department cover aa a simple anawer to all ite probleme,

Chie way and through increased effictenty of ite overseas personnel,

There are several reasons why CIA has abandoned ite original intentics

‘The structure which would meet the criteria suggested in this
memorandum would be ee follows:

ec:

Ranta.onenaane

1) The State Department waulé be granted general
clearance authority over all clandestine activity. This
might be effectuated on the British mode! by the appointment
of a Deputy Undersecretary of State for Intelligence, who
would act for the Secrotery in these matters and who might
serve as chairman of a Joint Intelligence Board.

2) The Joint Intelligence Board would include repre-
gentatives from all clements in the intelligence Sommonlty
and also from the White House.

- 3) Fhe operating branches of tho present CIA would be
veconstituted under gome blameless title {the National Informa-
tion Service}. . This new agency would be charged with regponsi-~
bility for clandestine callection, for covert political operations
and for paramilitery activities, & would submit projects to the
Doputy Undersceretary of State for Intelligence far clearance.

In general, the agency would bear somewhat the game relations
éhip to State as the Digarmament Administration and ICA
presently do. —

4a} A eccond eemlsindependent agency would be ect up, again
bearing a blameleaa title (the Foreign Ragsarch Agency), coordic
nate with the cperatians agency. This agency would be charged
with responsibility for collation and interpretation. fe would

Anciude CIA/DDI, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research is

State, and the various eervice functions now carried on by CLA

(photographic interpretation, biographical files, fer¢ign broadcast
