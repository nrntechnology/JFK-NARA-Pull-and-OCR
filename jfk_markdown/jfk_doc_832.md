with a limited nuxber of people. We believe the direction of the :
station is of high caliber, but not all the station effort is |
carefully directed at priority targets. Under current pereonnel
ceilings, there is little hope of increasing the manpover evail-
able for this critical effort. Thus, both Headquarters and the
station mst cerefully place emphasis on assignuent of priorities

and upon selective execution of the activities to meet those
priorities.

5. .The Mexico City Station approaches the classic type station
in opportunities and in operations. It has high-level Maison
operations, unilateral operations, joint operations with the host
government, and Soviet, Satelitte, Cuban, and indigenous Communist

- Party operations. Tt fas local colleborative liaigon with other |
U.S. agencies: the State Department, the Federal Buren of Investi-
gation, the Inmmtgration and Naturalization Service and the military.
To accomplish this wide range of tasks, the station is coxgenised
into the Soviet Branch, Cuban Branch, Satellite Branch,

Action Branch, Communist Party Brench, ani an operational catch-all
Which is called the “Operational Support Branch." This latter
branch is headed by a senior operations officer who has tvo assiat~
ante, but the branch in reality is an extension of the chief of
station's personal clandestine capabilities, giving force and .
effect to that facet of the chief of station's personality as an
operator. The deputy chief of station, in efdition to his admin-
istrative duties, also personally handles the Operations of three
projects. :

6. Mexico City 1s the only direct aly Link which Cuba has
with the Western Hemisphere. It is the major transit point for
| ; ell air travel to ani from Guba. Approximately 150 persons per
po : week travel each way to anf from Havana via Mexico City. This

| fact plays a prim the station's operational activi-
[Significant] ties. For exemple, cresffupper eet of the station's FI reporting

Qa

on Cuban activities in year dealt with travel, both Cuban .
and non-Cubsn, between Mexico City and Havana.
