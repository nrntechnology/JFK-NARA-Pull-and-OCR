foe Dr. Be KUHIOV professor, Univer. .y of Toronto, visited
Moscow from Septemoer 1-14, 1975 to undertake research at the USSR
Acadeny.of Sciences, under the USS2/Canada General Exchange :
Agreement. The research was carried out at the Academy of Sciences
cer Centre, 40 Vaveoha Street. KUNCT's host was furiy I.
‘7, 2nd in-charge of the Ccnputer Centre and on whom a separate
personality sketch is attached. . .

&

On September 3 while having a coffee break in the Computer
‘Centre KUNOY was approached by a man who identified himself as -
William MARTTI, an’ American who defected to the USSR in 1950, MARTIN
openly spoke about his past and stated that he now lives in Moscow
and that he is a consultant to TURGOY's group at the Computer

Centre. He said much of his work is done at ‘home but he does drop
into the Centre weekly.

It was at this time that MARTIN told KUNOV that he would
Ike to get out of the USSR even if he has to run certain risks. He
also said that (Bernon) MITCHELL feels the same and has voiced his. -
desire to the Soviet authorities. ‘

ie : MARTIN asked KUNOV if he might enquire with the Canadian
; » -@uthorities on his behalf to see what his status would be in this
country or if there was any chance of his being allowed in here as
a political refugee. KUNOV agreed to contact the Canadian Embassy
in'Foscow to see what the official view would be and notify MARTIH
ata later date. MARTIN seemed most pleased at this and left KUNOY
his heme télephona number, cautioning him not to say anything over
hone that would tiv off the Soviet authorities as to his intentions.
his first: meeting lasted a little over one half hour and took place
in the coffee lounge area of the Centre. There were other Sovicts
present in the lounse, however, TORGCY was not among them. KUNOV does
not believe the others were. aware of their conversation.

On the .5 September 75 KUNOV called at the Canadian Embassy,

Moscow and spoxe to a doorman asking him who he might speak to
-regarding sone Americans living in the USSR who would like to immigrate
to Canada. The doorman referred KUNOY to the office of a Mrs. Louise
O'CONNOR. KUNOV ther seoke to a U/l who stated that he was the
under secretary to Mrs. O'CONNOR. KUOV enouired about the Americans
living in the USSR and asked could they be allowed to immigrate to
Canada. The Embassy official would not ommit himself and stated that
“KUNOV should enouire officially with the nearest office of Manpower

'. ahd Immigration when he returned to Canada. KUIOV did not give this
official MARTI or NITCHELL's names. KU:OY telephoned MARTIN after
the Eabassy visit and stated that the revly from the Embassy was
negative. MARTIN seemed upset that KUNOY should phone him, then he

' later stated that it would probably be all right.-

. ; MARTIN met. KUNOV on at least to occasions after the
5 September, all at the Centre, usually in the coffee lounge and in
the general. presence of others. They szoke English at all times.
' MARTIN thanked KUNCY for his trouble in enquiring at the Embassy and
- cautioned KUNOV not to get personally involved with him in this
venture 2s. it would be bad news. XUOY oromised MARTIN that he woulda

on current problem areas in the Soviet systes. For example
he discussed dissidents in Soviet society and commented on one

' £reedom of expression than had been allowed previously. He
said that things were being said in Moscow that one would never
have heard in Stalin's era. Nevertheless, TCRGOV argued that
a. return to “terror tactics” under Soviet rule was always poss-

time because of the personal philosophy. of Premier Leonid BRESHHEV.

Dear Harry,

We have learned that on the evening of 8 September 1975, .

James WILKINSON of the U.S. Embassy in oscow had a conversation
ef. interest with a Canadian Embassy Officer.. Wilkinson stated
that while attending a social function at the Australian Embassy,
he engaged Canadian Consular Officer Geoffrey FARROW in conver-
gSation. Farrow advised that he had been. recently approached by
Dr. tlarry KERNUV, an Associate Professor of English at the
University of Toronto in Canada, regarding American defectors
Bernon F. MITCHELL and Willian it, MARTIN, Kernov implied that
he had had recent personal contact with one or both of the

’ defectors and reconmended that the Canadian government give
Martin and Mitchell permission to emigrate to Canada. Farrow

- furnished no further details regarding Kernov's contact.

i
} :
: . .”. During the sane conversation Farrow asked Wilkinson if he

“- ° 4a-- *eould. supply any basic background material on Mitchell and Martin.
f°. o-Bdlkinson replied that he. would pass Farrow's request on to
i. the Consular Section of the Embassy, Subsequently, Farrow was

. ~ given an unclassified article concerning the defectors which
: @ppeared in the June 1961 issue of True magazine. .

We would, of course, be interested in any indications that
Martin and Mitchell are attenpting to. leave the. USSR.and would
be grateful for any information you may be able to provide us
in regard to the above. : 4 ;
