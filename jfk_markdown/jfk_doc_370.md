1. SUMMARY, The Reference A. ANMSPELL exhibit toured six
Latin American countries during a five-month period, February-June
1964. With the exception of Guayaquil and La Paz -- where excel-
lent results were achieved -- the tour was only moderately success-
ful, and must be classified a failure in Quito, Santiago and
Montevideo. According to ANSPELL, the total number of persons who
viewed the exhibit was 6,720: Another 2,792 persons reportedly
attended conferences at which the AMSPELL team gave talks on the
Reference A. exhibit and the dangers..and.weaknesses.of-Castro- -~
Communism....Publicity was given the exhibit by 34 newspapers (47
items), 30 radio stations, and six television stations. AMSPELL
estimated the TV audtence at 1,300,000. Sample clippings are
enclesed under separate cover. Reports from WH stations and the
WAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL team lead us to conclude that the
tour was. a moderate success that could have been much better if
if had been better organized and if the ANSPELL team had had more
experience. (On balance) we believe the tour was well worth the = _
approximately $12,000.00 KUBARK paid out. We do not, however, .
believe it should be repeated in-the foreseeable future in view
of the relative inexperience shown by the AMSPELL team on the
recent tour and the many difficulties encountered in trying to
organize the exhibit in the various cities.

2. COLOXBIA. ns

sete a, Bogota The ANSPELL team arrived in Bogota on 12 February
1964. but were unable to make contact with the local AXSPELL/AMBARB :
contact until the uext day. They were unable to get adequate advance
publicity and had trouble finding space for the exhibit, About 200,
‘persons attended the exhibit, and AMSPELL conferences were attended by
approximately 485° persons. HLBA-G911Ircported{ G1 N -9's observations
on the local reaction to the tour, which he judged to be indifforent,
The AMSPELL teaii freely. admitted to WAVE that the Bogota operation was
something less than successful, but ‘blamed the lack of advance prepara~
tions and the existence Of an unfriendly press for their failure, It
should also be noted that the. AMSPELL team was not on the best of terms
with some of the™2ocal Cubans, and this fact probably had a good deal

to do with the poor showing. . .

b. Medellin, The showing in Medellin was better. than in
Bogota, ‘The press “was lukewarm but the director of the Caracol radio
station gave them’ considerable publicity, and they were able to hold
the exhibit in a‘central spot in the city. About 400 persons visited
the exhibit over ‘a period of three days, and 850 persons attended con-.

ferences given by the team, .

t : .

c. Cali, The team received wood advance press pYay in Cali,
: which was perhaps one reason for the fact that the local Communist party
was ‘also well prepared for their arrival, On the very first morning
of the exhibit, a large crowd of Communists tried to enter tne exhibit
with the obvious intention of starting trouble, and when they were as
locked out began to throw rocks and “stinkbombs" into the exhibit hall, ©
The incident provided considerable publicity for. AMSPBLL, as reported
in BOGO 4332. A total of 100 persons attended the exhibit. The AMSPELL
team claimed tnat the Communists were very strong in Cali and that work—
ing there was like swimming upstream, ,

3. ECUADOR.

a. Quito. The team arrived in Quito on 25 March, after spend-
ing several days in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain visas for Peru.
QUIT 5867 reported the AMSPELL team's personality clashes with the
local AMBARBs. and the consequent poor performance by the AMSPELL team,
who complained of the absence of police protection, adequate facilities
for the exhibit, etc., and departed just two days later on the 27th.
One member remained in Bogota to hold conferences, attended by 335. -
persons, Whiie not accepting the blame for this fiasco, the AMSPELL —
team generally corroborated tne above story in their debriefing by WAVE.
After such incidents as reported in QUIT 5867, we are reluctant to
recommend any future tours, .

b. Guayaquil, The AMSPELL team considered Guayaquil their
most successful operation, an opinion seconded by Guayaquil base. who
termed it. a “resounding success." (See QUIT 5867 and HEGA 2900). The
exhibit received front page coverage in "El Universo” and "El Telegrafo"
and they were given a half hour on a major TV station, An estimated
total of 1,200 persons visited the exhibit, and the team spoke before
40 members of a local group, Frente de Defensa Nacional, an

4, Santiago, Chile.

The AMSPELL team arrived in Sant tago on 3 March to coincide
with the opening of the Latin American Youth Congress (LAYC), The
Santiago operation was a complete loss because Chilean customs authori-
ties would not release the exhibit during the congress and the AMSPELL
team was unable to obtain space of any kind to hold conferences due to
competition from the congress for space. (See SAGO 6577). The AMSPELL
team had been counting on a contact in the Catholic University, Fernando u
SANHUESA, |to facilitate their activities but (SANHUESA}t ld them that
the LAYC was a failure from the Communist side and that°the AMSPELL teas
could contribute more by remaining quiet than. by actively propagandizing
