A Well, let's see. I would say that was probably around

1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then

later DDP.

Harvey held after he left Task Force W?

He went to work for a friend cf mine who had a law firm.

Harvey is a Lawyer.

0 Do you know whether or not they consider him an

established contact?

A No manner.

Q Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A I can't speak to that but the records that we have

don?t reflect.anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hold

the file.
e] Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?
A A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Q Personnel or personality file?
A Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
Q Doe you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?
A Well, Iwill say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

A Underwater demolition.
Q Where were those bases located?

along that long peninsula going down there. There were a

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of

economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

A Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

regime, his credit worthiness, and this type of thing. We

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

: 12 i the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, I
: 1s | guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from
é about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like
i . i
15 ; that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel kept ;o
i
16! saying that he had such a poor crop and this type of thing and
{
ish we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because
iat some of our own island assets told us they were out there cuttihg
= 19 this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,
; 20 this type of thing. So subsequentiy, we found out that he was

|

{

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any i
: i

|

21 |
z 22 | place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he
3 25 | could.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother
ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in: to

much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out
because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type
of operation that we did.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

i put it in the. warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came
up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

obviously the largest installation we,had. I think at its

height it had over 500 people in it.

Q Now, would Martinez have been one of those contract
people?
A Yes.

A Oh, yes.

Q And what kind of facilities did the Station have in
Miami? Physical facilities.

A Well, they were located on the south campus of the
University of Florida, I mean, the University of Miami, at
the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained
unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn
well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the
Dixie Highway inland. We had our own guard force.

President and Vice President, normal corporate setup.

Q Engaging in any business?
A No.
Q Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community,

how long could a non-official cover last?

A Well, obviously it didn't, but it was research
activities. Funded -- it:is a giant mechanism when you put

one of these things in for the funding and this type of thing,

Q ‘Yes, I understand.

A So it was a research activity and the only people that
ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You
know, somebody would make an inquiry, you knew, we can't accept
any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this

type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And.out of

this one.thing, of course, then we were running these innumera-

ble-other- covers with different activities. The guard

force, of course, were like -~ well, they wore uniforms, similar

to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think |
that there was -- in the later days at that site I think the
Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other

Government agencies, in other buildings, of course.

Q And this particular Station, then, was under the

supervision of the group we have been discussing?

A Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

9 When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume

responsibilities for the Miami Station?

A Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the

Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

Q Is there presently a Miami Station?
A Oh, yes. |
Q And how large is it at the present time?

A Well, since we -- I think when we closed down the
Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present |
time because we are in one of these periods: where: we -are
reassigning people, -.but I think by the end of this fiscal year
there’*are going to be between 11 and 14 people.

Q When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions
were being performed by the Miami Station?

A Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I
think I have lined them out at:one time --: collection of
positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this |

A Yes, sir.

Q Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter~
intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting
in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?

A Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I

recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a ‘Castro agent that

came in by small boat and when she was -- she came in with a
number of other people. When she hit the -- they hada recep-
tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.
The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there. and
we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under Immigration
andy Naturalization Service cover. When the JEW people did the
preliminary interrogation of these people they had to. fill
out forms, where. were you born, this type of thing, biegraphic-
type thing. These forms’ would be passed to our-peopte who would.
look at the forms and based on previous experience or what
they might have been doing, md they felt that perhaps they

might have some information of intelligence value, they would

reinterrogate them. /

A ‘Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is
known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy
the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers
from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a
relationship there that hac gone over a period of years
between the Agency and the Bureau.

EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION (Cont'd) i

BY MR. MANFREDI:

0 When we recessed for lunch vow were talking about the

Miami Station . Do I understand that the Miami Station was the

largest CIA station in the world?

A The largest CIA station in the world. ~.

en At its height?
A. Nothing comes anvplace close to it.
0 I wonder if vou could describe briefly for the record |

what the AMGits were.

A Well, the AMOTs were Cuban a Cuban intelligence
organization in exile. We full intended -- this was part of the
overall contingency nlan that US Government had. Should Castro
ever be overthrown, these neople would be the nucleus to go into
Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

‘6 Now, Ministry of the Interior, is that a euphemism
for Security Agency?

A, Well, in most countries of the world the Ministry of

Interior, unlike ours, is the security force, internal and

three to 599 who made up the Miami Station?

AY No.

o That was over and ahove the personnel of the Miami
Station?

A. Right.

iy These people were fulltime CIA employes, weren't thev?

A Right. WE11, let me -- these people really were --

thev were being subsidized by the Agency. They were employed
bys svorcover:companies, the largest of which was called.Latin
American Social. and Economic Résearch. Then we had another

smaller qroup that did the interrogating and they were under

vanothér’ cover, commercial cover, -- I just don't recall what it

was. But these peop.e ostensibly were employees of these wholly
ownéd -proprietaries of the Aqdencv. They were duly constituted,
incorporated, paid taxes, all this type of thing.

ie The salaries of these people, although paid indirectly

were naid by the CIA?

you came in so vou wouldn't become a ward of the State of the

couldn't bring these refugees into the larger establishment, so |

that is why we took the smaller establishment to preserve some

of intelligence. They compiled dossiers on the principals
inside Cuba. They carded -- they kept card files on every
refugee that came through the reception center. They provided -—~
they did do economic and social reporting. They put out a
