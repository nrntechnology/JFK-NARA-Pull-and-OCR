ATIC REGUIRED - RiFittCS

REFERENCE: DIRECTOR 294821

1. Being forwarded USC are copies of the QRPHONE/1 training
report, the JBMINIMUM evaluation, contact reports of meetings with
QRPHONE/1, a WOGEAR review of QRPHONE/1's book and some notes made
by the STPLIMFLAM Headquarters officer, Harvey B. DAITCHMAN (IDEN),
efter his meetings with QRPHONE/1. These are for the information
of both LCPIPIT and London Station and, taken together, should give
you both the flavor of the variety of measures taken to assess the
operational potential of QRPHONE/1.

2. During PAUPEROS’ TDY at Headquarters we discussed the
necessity of having QRPHONE/1 undergo an intersive seven day
STFLIMYLAM training program to be conducted by DAITCHMAN. It is
our opiaion that in order for this training to be of maxinum
benefit, QRPHONE/1 and DAITCHMAN ought to be ensconced in a
safehouse facility which provides security, comfort and an
atmosphere conducive to learning. it is important that the
training be conducted in a locale which will allow QRPHONE to give
bis full attention without being disturbed by his multitude of
business and social contacts. Therefore, ve recommen. that LCPIPIT
rent @ cottage or beach house away from London for the duration of
the training cycle. In discussing this with QRPRORE, he readily
agreed and indicated that there would be no difficulty in getting
away from his family for am long as ve thought necessary. He

sisply would tell thes and his business contacts that he was
traveling on the continent. Please advise us of the dates which
are determined to be convenient to PAUPEROS and QRPHONE/1. The
Headquarters officer would prefer either the third or fourth
veek of September, and certainly not before.

3. As indicated fo the reference ve eclicit coments frou
LCPIPIT and London Station on the results of our varied asscssnents
of QRPHONE/1 and our decision to move ahead in the new operational
directions described in OEPW-1661. We view the coming year as a
trial one for these purposes and the Project Renewal has been
subuitted with that understandirg clearly described.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
-. SUBJECT: Hooting with QRPHONE/1

2. £ met with QRPHONE/1 for much of the 12th of July

and wearing tvo hats. Wo first went through tho third phase

of the training exercise in which I had been playing the role

of an agent prospect whow he was to assess and recruit, aod then

later in the OTR safehouse I identified myself as the Headquarters
. officer responsible for his project. Incidentally, he did an

excelient job in all three phases of the training exercise and

' @id particularly woll on the recruitzent itself. QRPHONE/1 is

clever, isaginativo, has an excellent grasp of this espect of

: teadecraft and handled himsolf particularly woll in a a complex

and Changing training sconsrio.

.  @,. As the Headquarters stsff officer responsible for his
reject, X described in dotail the reasons for the long, sorious
ook at his porformance these last several months, the changing

intelligence and operational requirenents we face, and the care—
ful perotiny he had been given as we bogan to map out new direc-
tions for hin, all of which ended with thia advance four-week

- training progran, testing, and evaluation asd substantive

briegings. ‘Be said he was a bit confused by the WOMUSE brief-
ing of lest week so I explained how that tied in with this evoning's
planned discussion on the China prograa.

Lo 3. We discussed his itinerary, personal plans and the”
pacing of the next several months, all of which wero clarified
to bis satisfaction.

“(apt. 11K, 372 Central Park West) recontly returned

' W£itred Burchett who gave it to a North Vietnamese
: £eliend to give to Ward, Ward was asked to find an
‘American publisher and he, in turn, asked for QRPIONB/1]'s
‘help. Burchett is an old friend of Ward's and stays
‘at his apartment whenever he visits New York. Tho “|
fanugeript has alroady becn given to a publisher in i
Europe. QRPHONE/1 asked if ve would be interested in

‘Without straining his cover.

db. His friend, Lyle Stuart, the publisher, has

* Been trying to buy the American branch of the Oxford
University Press, and apparently is about to consummate
‘the deal. He offered QRPHONE a job as his European

: Representative if the deal goes through.

‘Noe. Per TRUTSCHYAN! Fequest I asked QRPHONE to give
his instractor a copy of the long list of names and

using the “Mr. Stanley" indicator 91 Monday afternoon, ;
31 July. This is simply to check in and let us know he is
on the way end how things havo come thus far. He calculated
that ho needed another $500.00 for the U.S. portion of his
overall trip since LCPIPIT apparently had not anticipated
this when he was given his original advance. I arrangod
‘through the good offices of* .4n New York to get $500.00

to QRPHONE today.

gents for hin to pursce while he is in Malta. I said Kon
vould brief him on those roquirenents on the 24th of July
4f we had any. Incidontally, QRPHONE mentioned that Litbol
Bergman comes to New York City every Thursday and told
QRPHONE that he could be reached on telephone number 265-2500,
QRPHONE said if we cared to we might want to track that

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Final Contact with QRPHONE/1 in New York City

1. As arranged previously, I zet with QRPHONE/1 at
the WOMOLD safesite in New York City from 1000 hours to
+1230 26 July. The neating was intended to wrap up loose
ends, convey our decision to pursue the STFLIMFLAM prograa
(providing QRPHONE/1 bimself was amenable), and to make
clear that we expect measurable operational progress withi
the next year. coo

2. Although QRPHONE/1 had been debriefed on 24 July
by other Headquarters officers regarding his trip around
WOCORK, I asked him to review it agsin for ay information
so I could put it clearly in perspective as it related to
our plans for him in the coming year. I'11 not bother with
the detsils here because such have already been written for
the record elsewhere, but suffice it to say that QRPHONE/1]
was both pleased and relieved at the reception he got fron
his old contacts because of the reflection tnese receptions
had on bis own bona fides. The allegations of his BKTRUST
affiliation which had floated throuzh Europe were never
mentioned by his WOCORK contacts; on the contrary at least
one of them urged QRPHONE/1 to return soon to WOCORK because
this is where the action is. This sane individual gave

reading materials on the Cornaunist dialectic and
urged him to study them closely. This greatly inpressed

because it showed how accurate were the briefings
given hia by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM officer and
demonstrated that we knew our tactics.

3. I then reviewed with QRPHONE/1 the reasons for our
long close scrutiny of bim and bis performance these last
several aonths followed by our selection of him for advance
training, testing, and redirection in the strong hope we bad
that be would accept this new task because of ite priority
idaportance to our national collection requirements. I asked

QRPHONE/2 his impressions of it all, bis reaction to the
STFLIMFLAM proposal, and whether he would accept its
Genanding obligations. QRPHONE said he certainly would

and that he found it a real challenge to his intellect and
‘his operational skills. The tedious rtudy of the dialectic
would not deter him. His only concern was how he’ should. -
actually play it es he developed relationships with .
Sppropriate party members and, ultinately, the Chinese in
8] « -I pointed out he needn't concern himself with
the last point because tbat would be part of the purpose

Of the ten-day training program in SMORANGE in September
which would be given him by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM
officer. I said the training would require total emersion
for ten days straight, probably in some secluded beach
houge on the coast where all involved could reside full
time. He said this would present no problea cover-vwise;

he would siaply tell his family he had gone to the continent.
I said that PAUPEROS would be workiag out the details of
thia with him, probably after bis return from vacation.

4. I said that given QRPHONS/1's past performance,
his credentials with the radical left, and his apparent
interest in vigorously pursuing the STFLIMFLAH progran ve
expected to be able to measure in six to eight months the
likelihood of his being able to achieve all the STFLIMFLAM
Objectives based upon the progress he would bave made by
then vith bis Chicos contacts. Should it appear that the
STFLIMFLAK operation would not succeed we would be discussing
alternative courses of action with him by the end of the
year. He dic say that of all the countries in Europe where
his STFPLIMFLAM and radical left potential is probably the
best, Italy would be first and Denmark second.

5. I told QRPHONE/1 that his meeting with PAUPEROS
. had been moved to 31 July as he requested, reviewed his
European vacation plans and his Malta trip and wished hia
the very best of luck. At this point QRPHONE/1 certainly | ._.
geens willing and able aggressively to pursue our operational
plans. We shall see.

WOGEAR Review of African Liberation Movements

: in general, the author has done a reasonably good job
*, describing the i.istorical development of the various African
liberation movements, especially when one considers the com-
Plexity and number of splits and mergers that have occurred
, Within and among the movements over the years. There are
several glaring inaccuracies, however, in the author's con-
. Clusions about the current position and effectiveness of the
+, Several Portuguese African liberation movements.

_ Regarding Angola, the author characterizes the MPLA as an

_ Adeologically-oriented group (i.e., Soviet doctrine) that has
‘failed to grasp and utilize to its advantage the tribal realities
“that exist in Angola. The author fails to acknowledge, however,
that the MPLA has had some success, albeit limited, in building

a movement that is national and multiracial in character rather

*. than tribally oriented. Despite its urban intellectual leader-

_ Ship, the MPLA has had some success winning local support’ in

* pural eastern Angola.

; + By contrast, GRAE ranks a poor second. From inception,
its primary base of support has been the large Angolan refugee
‘population of Bakongo tribesmen who live in southwestern Zaire.
Although the organization has won some support among Bakongo ty
kinsmen across the border in northwestern Angola, it has failed
to broaden its base because of its thinly disguised regional
and tribal make-up. Moreover, Roberto's unwillingness to
delegate authority or compromise have produced chronic disputes
+at the leadership level. The author's conclusion that GRAE is
‘a formidable force to be reckoned with in the future of Angola
- ds contradicted by the fact that the MPLA is by far the

. largest and most effective of the three nationalist groups _
opposing the Portuguese in Angola.

MOZAMBIQUE

. The present FRELINO leadership does not appear to be in the
: tate of disarray in 1972 that the author believes it is.

Although some differences undoubtedly persist, the present
leaders seem to have closed ranks somewhat since the departure
of Simango in late 1969. For the present, any internal squabbles
that may exist are not noticeably affecting FRELIMO'’s fighting -
abilities inside Mozambique.

RHODESIA, SOUTH WEST AFRICA, SOUTH AFRICA

- Reasonably straightforward and up to date. No serious
‘deficiencies.

Direct Psychological Assessment
°
ORPHONE/1
The psychological evaluation consisted of an extended inter-

view and the JEMINIMUM test. His intelligence as measured by the
JBMINIMUM is within the Bright Normal range by U.S. standards.

‘The test scores were not as high as would be expected in compari-
‘-son to his behavior and life style. The discrepancy could be due

‘to the fact that he suffers from inferiority feelings and is

/.working overtime to compensate. He gets considerable satisfaction

and mileage out of his authorship; however, it takes a great deal

:- Of his energy in order to discipline himself enough to write a
“-book, His talents are much more in the field of journalism.
’Mentally alert and very perceptive, he is aware of what is happening

around him, These same traits would serve him well as an access

Jagent, However, his reporting may reflect some distortions because

is memory is not strong, and he tends to remember those events
that are of interest to him, He naturally has good manual-

vmanipulative skills, plus a practical bent that should enable him
‘to easily and effectively learn and carry out tradecraft techniques.

' Emotionally, Subject is fickle, “Out-of-sight - out of

/ mind," describes the way he relates to others. The reason for
‘this is that one of his primary needs is to be accepted and
“Liked, Most of his life has been spent seeking acceptance, and
‘because he is emotionally dependent he rapidly and intensely
“becomes involved, If separated from someone with whom he is
‘involved, he has difficulty maintaining loyalty, and begins t to |
ook for another way to satisfy his needs. .

-";°.An important fact which his case officer should remember te
hat he is not motivated by an ideology, but rather by the person

who represents a particular ideology. His relationship with his
‘ease officer is of prime importance. To ensure his loyalty to
‘the organization and consistent performance, he will need intense

handling. The problem is that he may balk since he resists

‘authority. He has the tendency to think that he knows it all,
.as witnessed by his never completing a degree.

14-0000

ee :

iHe has worked hard to establish an identity for himself, and could
+ not cope as effectively with a new one. .

Gonéiueton: :

. . Subject is a bright, extremely ambitious, and ageressive
individual who appears to be motivated to work for the Agency

by, three needs: 1) a need to be accepted and liked; 2) a material-
‘dstic need; and 3) as a vehicle to be vindictive to former loyal-
ties, t.e., the far left or radical movement in this country.

+. Though he is capable of switching loyalties, and his life

history attests to this fact, it is very difficult to predict his
future behavior since so much depends on his life circumstances, .
One statement that can be made is that, given his personality, Lae
it is very doubtful if he would return to his former allegiances. ‘
,, But: if not personally involved with someone from this agency

:"\" Notes on QRPHONE by Harvey B. DAITCHMAN

-

< °° 1. Revolutionary Image: Discussed. briefly how it -is

‘+ obtained. Pointed out there is a pattern to it which is dis-

. cernable among revolutionaries. It is ustally issue oriented ~
‘in the beginning, the war being one of the key issues, and it
"gradually evolves into a desire to engage in practical activities
‘which usually expressed best on a continuing basis through work
in an organization. Also connected with this process. is the
gradual development of a different "outlook." It is usually a
mixture of idealism and Marxism-Leninismsocialism-Mao Tse-tung

- thought. Usually unstructured but developing.

-.)°. « It 48 possible in this stage to move from one group to
‘. another without any particular approbation being attached for
this transience. This is particularly so if one starts way

- outside a M-L-ist group and moves inward towards it. Quite

a different thing to start in a M-List group and go out.

\. Also in development of a new outlook one comes to study

a variety of revolutionary literature. This can take one into
dafferent areas, anarchism, GW advocacy, revolutionary nihilism,
socialism, Marxist-Lenism, etc. However, to get to latter

(at must be done logically.

:°- 2. Tightly Structured Op: Emphasis upon tight, controlled
contacts which seek to accomplish a specific purpose--collection

of info not necessarily one nor always one. Purpose is to lay
‘ground work for future developments. Purpose to establish certain
contacts which can be later used in either positive or negative
fashion. Structured conversation is also essential. It too
should seek to accomplish something, directed so as to be useful

to future development of op: e.g., desire to have an explanation
‘for an action to be undertaken later--so bring up in conversation
with someone so that can use that conversation later as explanation
‘for interest in a subject, knowledge of a subject, etc. It is
“checkable, .

: :3. Study: Most important aspect in opening phases of op.
“Without correct study and without development (understanding)

of “correct outlook" one will always be a dilettante to the,
outside looking in, someone who is useful to them “under certain

: conditions," but not someone who is reliable, and not a dependable
revolutionary. This is really the key, the ideological tool,

- 4t will open doors that cannot otherwise be entered.

. 4. Contacts: ‘Those to be exploited now and those to be
‘used in or for future time. In the beginning the contacts which
are developed are to be used as a means of building his
‘justification for having begun the serious study of Marx,
14-00000 ot yy soy . t

Lenin, and Mao.’ This must be discussed with people so that many
are aware of it. These conversations will be later used when he
explains how and why and when he became interested.

5. Diffuse Nature of Op: In beginning op has a diffuse
nature. It is necessary to make many contacts. Some will be
-more useful than others, but all have potential for use in
one circumstance or another. Since we have no way of knowing
how or from whom the Chinese collect their intelligence, seek
; out, or otherwise spot budding revolutionaries we can assume
- . that some one of his acquaintances will report his interest
“4m Mao, etc. We can assume that through some of his activities
Chinese will build up his dossier so that at a later date when
‘we go directly to the Chinese for help they can look in their
dossier and see that x number of months ago, etc., various
things were reported. Etc.

-.» @, Ops as a Process of Development: Permit no diversions
or detours which might become permanent. This would include
targets of opportunity, etc. Must always maintain correct
operational line and cannot reach target by following various
diversionary tributaries in the temporary interest of collecting
. Marginal intelligence, Must be prepared to sacfrice. diversionary
-. tasks in pursuit of main goal or objective. If tangential
things are folled up we then have a different op, and a new op
line, must be cautious with this. Ops line serves as guide for
whole op from beginning to end.

fat 7. Tactics in Op: Must always be carefully thought out so
as to insure forward development of op, Something must be seen
-, emerging or useful, or having potential future value for develop~
"ment of op, otherwise it is pointless to undertake it. Tactics
“are details. Details are most important aspect in day to day
+ running of op. They must be paid attention to, must be contrib-
- utory, must be carried out in correct sequence, and we must keep
in mind that at one or more points it is these details which will
: be subject of the scrutiny of the opposition. IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT THESE DETAILS APPEAR LOGICAL TO THIS OPPOSITION, even if they
_, may seem illogical to us at times. Our logic is not the same as
communist logic.

. - °8. Ops is Step by Step Process: Op should/or can be nae
divided into steps, phases, stages, segments, whatever. Each

phase should dovetail into the next. To some extent a general

_ Outline can be developed. Each of the major phases should

- be sub-divided into stages so that they can be dealt with step -

. by step. For example: Three broad categories:

1.<-18t Phase: All initiatives are ours. We do all the work,

lay ground for future stages. We have a flexible line which a
- permits making maximum contacts to be correctly exploited. We

’ give training. Also devise concrete activities for him to carry
‘out. .

14-0000

. Zuc Yaase: Chinese and others have shown interest. We

will exploit this interest. After he has completed first phase
we will begin to make structured contacts with the Chinese. In
these contacts he will show that he has a grasp of the ideology,
is interested in learning more, desires to study more intensively.
Will use as negative examples: his book, Panthers, some aspects
of Bergman's behavior, the unstructured and undisciplined nature

. Of most revolutionary activists in U.S., particularly among the

blacks, or whatever may seem appropriate at time contact is
made. However, will seek their help to further his study and ~
will indicate recognition of need to return.to U.S. in order

’ to undertake correct role in revolutionary struggle. At this

stage we will have an idea of interest of Chinese. We will be
able to determine whether we can expect progress or not. If

’ they prove willing to help they will then be asked to guide

his further study, to help him. Through this help they will

be able to see the development which has taken place. We should
get a good feeling of their willingness to guide him after a
couple of meetings. If we are shut out then must make ops

‘Judgenent from that point on--can always target against Soviets

and use Chinese as negative example. If they are interested
we will then lose some aspects of our initiative, but in‘ essence
the more initiative we lose to them, the more they try to

‘direct him, the deeper he becomes involved with them, which is

our objective--one of them. He must continue his study.

“8rd Phase: Continue his study; continue his contacts all

. around, but by now should have significant contacts and can
- @ispense with the more general "sparrow" approach. Once certain

of their willingness to help we ask about a trip to Peking
to study after which he wants to return to U.S, and take active

a role.

° "Recognize that this may be a sticking point. We don't

‘want him here. However, this idea has to always be in the

forefront as far as the Chinese are concerned otherwise they

- have little reason to be interested in him. This MUST appear to

be ‘his goal. We may be able to circumvent it later for one
reason or another, or it might be useful to bring him back
temporarily. This decision must be reserved for that time.

ao ““Phese stages and sub-stages must be further divided if

we are to understand the operation correctly and are to carry

at out correctly. Each action he is asked to undertake must

be seen leading to something concrete in the next or another _ |
step. The whole op goes STEP BY STEP. We do not insert Sos
unrealistic objectives, or those which would be desirable but
may be difficult. This is a waste of time. We only seek to

: . do what is possible--possible is what can be turned into reality.-

. “Emphasis must be made on "step by step" approach and must
be maintained. Otherwise we can trip ourselves up by trying to
- accomplish something which is out of sequence FOR THEM. For

14-0000

exanple: He has read Marx and Lonin. We might say he's quite
familiar with it. We could then say that he will read Mao and
after that he will be able to pretend to be a Maoist. All of this
is true. He could say it’ and act like he and others thought

a Maoist should act. However, appearance and essence are not
synonomous. It might appear to non-Naoists that our troop is a
Maoist because he can talk as good a game as anyone else--or
better than those who have not studied as uuch--but the essence
of being a Maoist is not contained in such superficialities.

. Nor is the essence of being a Marxist-Leninist so contained.

He cannot, for example, bloom or emerge as a Maoist and find
acceptance with the Maoists. They know the process it takes to
get there: "Several years of assiduous study can produce good
results.” (Some Chinese quote on studying Mao.)

. 9. Their Weapon is Also Our Tool: Once we understand
correctly how they wield their weapon, the dialectical method,
it can serve as our tool to pry our way into their camp.
Through proper study and understanding we can deva op and promote
Q's superiority among his friends and acquaintances. To Marxists
he will be much more acceptable and his intel product will
probably be enhanced since they will talk on subjects they might
not have touched upon in the past, he will be more trusted, and
“also he will have better recognition of key developments in
Marxist world turough better understanding of their reality.

“30, Some activities which we might consider enroute,

eet 7 a. Start His Own Study Group: Chinese would be very
interested, Unlike most study groups with which I am familiar
. he would stress study of ideology--in correct way. However, to
prevent them from profiting from such study they can be tied in
knots for months dealing with a variety of ideological problems.
. There is no point in our developing for their use good
_’ revolutionaries. However, it would provide reason for frequent
./ contact with Chinese in order for them to help him in the
development of his group. Would probably lead him into contact
‘with other interesting types. Might have it for “Americans
only" abroad--to avoid problems with Brits: whatever:

poy b. Might Talk About Starting a One Man Institute for
Studying African Revolution: could put out a four page broad-
‘sheet for peanuts. It would discuss various African problems.
His book gives him good reason for such study. He might draw.
“one or two people to him. Can use this too as basis for approach
.to Chinese. He will have come to recognize that he had not
painted the true picture of national lib struggle in his book
and through his broadsheet he seeks to rectify some his ideas.
we c. He could seek to do another book on "The Dialectics
of African Revolution." Here again the help of various comnunists,
- Marxist-Leninists, and particularly the Chinese in providing
‘guidance (correct guidance) would give him frequent access and

contact--providing the Chinese are willing to help.

inerrant Seren neniy ent

neater rent beimet ei =

14-00000

, d. Start a Broadsheet for American Revolutionaries

Abroad: This would give him contct with a wide variety

“of radical U.S, types abroad. It would also have feed back

into the American scene and in part fulfill his requirement to

_ have an active role with U.S, revolutionary developments, Etc.
Etc.

fs

we e. There are other activities which he might also
undertake. The above are a few ideas of what we can do to

’ “promote" QRPHONE. He can do a number of different things

. at the sametime since much of it overlaps and is hence com-

patible. However, each must be structured, carefully handled,

‘with great attention to the details. STEP BY STEP.

.'+ Some Words of Caution: Our experience clearly indicates
that it is incorrect to rely upon either the agent or the
station to provide the impetus. This seems to be true for a
number of reasons. Case officers change often, chiefs of ops,
bases, or stations change--there is not much continuity. We

- are thinking of a long term operation which, as it grows,

. becomes very complex. It is not easily understood by someone

_ who gets involved after it has been going for sometime. It is

- even more true of changes in station leadership whose attitude
is largely developed on his subjective feelings from reading
only cable traffic. The initiative, the operational ideas,

» @te,. are best kept in Hqs. There is so much more information

’ here to work with, people with whom one can talk, staffs, etc.
Also most officers in the field simply do not have the time to
sit down and plan in the kind of detail that is needed to

. continue and develop the op. It calls for solid knowledge of

. the communist reality in order to insure that no errors creep
.{in those contacts he may make. It calls for someone to have the
itime to read, study, certain publications, articles, etc., and
“then to figure out whether or not a given publication or article
can be used to make a useful contact, write a useful letter, etc.
|‘ If so, how, and then go the field with the idea, and concrete

+ | directions about how it should be used, Case officers most

‘" likely won't be exposed to the same material and probably wouldn't
; have the planning time necessary, or the various resources of
mae to do what needs to be done. . wees

” this is not to suggest that the field has nothing to ‘say.
However, if the understanding can be clearly made that this is in
fact a joint operation, with Hqs having an opportunity for big.

* dnput, with the understanding that the only thing which matters
‘>to all concerned is the correct development of the operation in
“the given concrete onditions and not either the Hqs or the field
trying to establish some kind of supremacy of rights over the
other--there is a good chance of success.

Agent Profile - QRPHONE/1

QRPHONE/1 is an American citizen and a singleton agent
who has been a recruited asset for some seven years. He has
extensive contacts among lettist, radical, and communist
movements in Europe and Africa and was able to/sustain his
relations with many such figures for operational purposes
in spite of a formal disassociation some years ago.
Originally a member himself of a radical pro-communist
group, his disenchantment with internal personal and
political dissension in an organization to which ne had
firmly committed himself led later to his acceptance of an

operational relationsbip with the Agency. Although tarzeted
after his recruitment at the plethora of new left and radical

elements in Europe, essentially for intelligence collection
purposes, QRPHONE/1] has recently been redirected toward the
Chinese Communists with a view to ingratiating himself and ,
seeking their guidance and support as he demonstrates an i
interest in more effectively acting on their behalf. Our
ultimate objective is to precipitate invitations to Mainland
China which will lead to successively higher ecbelons of
contact within the Chinese Government.

To prepsre ORPHONE/1 for this demanding task, extensive 1
retraining, assessment and remotivation were recently . as .
accomplished and selective recontact was made by him with
bis more influential and pertinent communist contacts.
Reactions to QRPHONE/1's alleged desire to more fully commit
himself to the communist Chinese cause and the assistance
rendered thus far by these coununist contacts are encouraging
indicators of the potential success of this agent to achieve
our goal.

Although a complex man to manage operationally because v4
of his own background and the mix of his ideological and
professional motivations, QRPHONE/1's intelligence ana
personality are such as to well equip him to meet the

~ challenge of the tests the Chinese are likely to throw his !
way. He is based in England, as is his case officer, and ad
operational meetings: are held in secure safe sites, sometines .
on the continent.’

QRPHONE/1 has produced numerous intellizence reports
on communist and radical tarzets in addition to his covert
action functions as a journalist and author. His long-tera
tenure with the Agency will be determined in part by the degree
of success of his new Chicom directions.

describing the people he met and his reception by them.
It should be noted here that several of the individuals
that QRPHONE was to have seen were out of town or

QRPHONE met with Leibel Bergman at his home
and stayed overnight (14-15 July) as his guest.
QRPHONE told Bergman that he had decided to make
: a a full-time commitment to the study of Marxist-
an mS Leninist (M-L) doctrine in order to become more
proficient in M-L theory and would like to join
the RU to further this ambition. Bergman's reaction,
according to QRPHONE, was enthusiastic. Bergman
gave QRPHONE some M-L literature (which was the
same as the literature Andy gave him several
weeks ago to study) which he felt would be helpful.
Bergman stated that if QRPHONE was really interested -
in becoming involved in the M-L movement he should .
return to WOCORK because that "was where all the
inconsistencies were." Bergman invited QRPHONE to

take part in some M-L study groups but didn't
say what exactly would be studied. The
j following are some general comments QRPHONE
H provided about Bergman. Bergman doesn't like
Newark, he has been mugged several times and
: would like to go back to California; however,
i . that is not possible at this tine, so Bergman
i will instead move to New York City. Bergman
: is pleased with the current development of the
i RU. He said that the recent trip to China by
i several RU members was successful and that the
: . trip had been pleasant for them. QRPHONE
commented that it appears that Bergman does not
have the same control of the RU that he formerly
had, although he is regarded as the "guru" of
the RU.

NEW YORK

QRPHONE said that Richard Ward is attempting

to sell the English language rights of

Prince Sihanouk's book My War With the CIA.

Ward had been trying to get Lyle Stuart to

purchase the rights but Stuart's antipathy

toward Wilfred Burchett, "that old Communist"
according to Stuart, was too great. Burchett
apparently wrote the forward and Stuart doesn't
want to publish anything with his name on it.
QRPHONE, in our presence, called Stuart and
convinced him to at least read the manuscript of

the book before he turned it down. Ward has a

South Vietnamese student living with him as a

combination houseboy/companion. This student,
whose name is David Truong, is the son of the

South Vietnamese presidential candidate Truong

Dinh Dzu, who ran in the 1967 South Vietnames election
on a peace platform and who is now in prison.
QRPHONE said that this student has amassed a large

collection of books on intelligence, that the

books are expensive and that he doesn't have any

idea where the money to buy the books came fron.

He also said he doesn't think Truong has

immigration. papers to stay in WOCORK legally. I
‘asked if Truong was in any way involved with the

recent attempt to hijack a plane to Hanoi. QRPHONE

stated that Truong knew the hijackers and might have
- known something about the attempted hijacking

because the hijackers had also stayed at Ward's

apartment.

Ward is going to France soon for a vacation
with a girlfriend he refused to identify because
he feels his apartment and phones are bugged
“by at least ten intelligence agencies.“ Before
he goes on vacation he intends to stop in Paris
and’ meet with DRV and PRG officials as well as
with Wilfred Burchett. (Ward also met with
Jane Fonda prior to her recent trip to the DRV).
Ward will try to visit.QRPHONE in London sometime
in September before he returns home. Ward -
claimed that a "wealthy benefactor” gave his some
$1000 to cover the cost of his vacation. Ward
himself is broke and makes only about $60 per

' week salary. : .

DETROIT

QRPHONE was unable to see Milton Henry,
leader of the New Republic of Africa, who was on
vacation in Japan. He did manage to see
FNU Boggs, who is apparen:ly no longer involved
with radical organizations but who is acting as a
clearinghouse for black and white radicals.
QRPHONE characterized Boggs as less doctrinaire
and less dogmatic than he had been in the past.
Boggs' feeling about the black radical movement
is that it is in considerable disarray.

CHICAGO

QRPHONE saw LPWEAKLY/1 who told him that he.
was trying to get an invitation to visit China.
LPWEAKLY/1 told QRPHONE that if he went he would.
see about taking him along. This was the first.
that QRPHONE knew about LPWEAKLY/1's plans. ~~
QRPHONE was unable to see either Sidney Lens or
Hal Block because they were out of town. He did
corroborate the fact that Block had recently.
been to China. QRPHONE spent some time with
Don Wright, who was a member of the RU delegation
to China. Wright is now a full-time RU official
responsible for organizing RU cells in the
Mid-West and seems committed to revolution
although he doesn't speak in M-L terminology.
Wright stated that one problem now facing the RU
involves national exposure, i.e., getting
minorities to become involved with the RU. This
is a change from past RU philosophy which was that

said Wright is very bitter toward the Black

Cleaver is “bad" and that Huey Newton and
Bobby Seale are "corrupt".

SAN_ FRANCISCO

In San Francisco QRPHONE stayed with .
Davida Fineman. The mysterious M, who appeared j
in several of her letters to QRPHONE, is Martin :
Nichols, a Marxist scholar of note who translated
into the English the entire Fundamentals of
Political Economy. He was once a member of the
Ro

Emotionally, Davida is not as depressed as
she was several months ago, even though her brief
exposure to the world of labor union organizing
was a failure. Her comments about the RU were
to condemn the Bruce Franklin group (Venceramos
Organization) which she said is going to bring
disaster to the whole RU because of its :
predilection for violence before the groundwork . ‘
for revolution has been laid. Fineman feels that bo *
Robert Avakian, a high RU official, is less wild 4 t :
and erratic than in the past and has in fact poo
become a good M-L.

QRPHONE saw paul Richards, Hodee Edwards‘
son-in-law. Richards is a former CP member from
the Mid-West, which he left because of the people. :
He feels that the Mid-West is a part of the 3
country where the Government ought to test nuclear : i
warheads. QRPHONE also met with Earl and Lee Rose. :
Earl was in the RU delegation to China where he boas lus
must have caused some embarrassment to the ae
delegation by his naivete. He attempted to meet
African revolutionaries, particularly members of
: the MPLA, which he didn't realize were Moscow~
“G . oriented. Rose asked QRPHONE to write and send
H him material on the various African liberation
movements. Lee Rose works for Bell Telephone

QRPHONE went to the Martin Luther King
Center for Social Change, formerly the Martin
Luther King Foundation, where he met with
Tom Porter, the head staffer of the organization.
There was recently a split in the Center and the :
Executive Director, a Dr. Scott, was forced out . id.
of office. The office is still vacant and,
according to Porter, will remain so for the
immediate future. The reason for the continued :
vacancy is apparently to allow Coretta King and aa
other members of the Board of Directors to 4
maintain direct control. Porter is a former ta
writer for Freedom Ways Magazine. QRPHONE said i
that Porter knew of him but didn't say exactly how. ny
QRPHONE told Porter he would consider writing a ti
brief on the Center for LPWEAKLY. QRPHONE said
that the Center is going to establish a foreign
affairs staff which will be headed by Jack O'Dell,
an old CP member.

3. After QRPHONE's discourse on his trip, Andy
discussed in broad terms what he could expect in the
next year with regard to securing entre to the Chinese.
QRPHONE was told that once he was proficient in M-L
he would be expected to go out and test his knowledge
with various individuals and organizations in order to
gain access and become known to the Chinese. Andy
emphasized it wouldn't be easy, that QRPHONE would have
to be diligent and patient, but that in the end, if he
was successful, the benefits would be many. QRPHONE

accepted this.

20 July 1972

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Rod Sweet, Chief CA-3
ATTENTION : Mr. Ken Rosen, Rm 3D18
SUBJECT : ORPHONE/1

A preliminary verbal read-out was given on 7 July in which it

was stated that Subject was an emotionally stable individual.

We still support this statement, but a more in-depth analysis
revealed there are certain aspects of his personality that are
susceptible, These are discussed in the report. If any part

of the report is unclear or requires further discussion, please
contact us. Meanwhile, we would appreciate receiving follow-

up information on Subject's performance in order to help us refine
and improve our methods of assessment.

1. Attached is the psychological assessment of ORPHONE/1,
14-00000

we *y

poten rt

Direct Psychological Assessment
of
ORPHONE/1

The psychological evaluation consisted of an extended inter-
view and the JBMINIMUM test. His intelligence as measured by the
JBMINIMUM is within the Bright Normal range by U.S. standards.

The test scores were not as high as would be expected in compari-
son to his behavior and life style. The discrepancy could be due
to the fact that he suffers from inferiority feelings and is
working overtime to compensate. He gets considerable satisfaction
and mileage out of his authorship; however, it takes a great deal
of his energy in order to discipline himself enough to write a
book, His talents are much more in the field of journalism.
Mentally alert and very perceptive, he is aware of what is happening
around him, These same traits would serve him well as an access
agent. However, his reporting may reflect some distortions because
his memory is not strong, and he tends to remember those events ~
that are of interest tu him, He naturally has good manual-
manipulative skills, plus a practical bent tha-_. should enable him.
to easily and effectively learn and carry out tradecraft techniques,

Emotionally, Subject is fickle. "Out-of-sight - out of
mind," describes the way he relates to others. The reason for
this is that one of his primary needs is to be accepted and
liked. Most of his life has been spent seeking acceptance, and
because he is emotionally dependent he rapidly and intensely
becomes involved. If separated from someone with whom he is
involved, he has difficulty maintaining loyalty, and begins to
look for another way to satisfy his needs. :

An important fact which his case officer should remember is
that he is not motivated by an ideology, but rather by the person
who represents a particular ideology. His relationship with his
ease officer is of prime importance. To ensure his loyalty to
the organization and consistent performance, he will need intense
handling. The problem is that he may balk since he resists
authority, He has the tendency to think that he knows it all,
as witnessed by his never completing a degree.

ORPHONE/1

Subject is not by nature a role player, and it would not
be operationally advantageous to have him switch roles, for he
cannot psychologically handle role playing over a period of time.
He has worked hard to establish an identity for himself, and could
not cope as effectively with a new one,

Conclusion:

Subject is a bright, extremely ambitious, and aggressive
individual who appears to be motivated to work for the Agency
by three needs: 1) a need to be accepted and liked; 2) a material-
istic need; and 3) as a vehicle to be vindictive to former loyal-
ties, i.e., the far left or radical movement in this country,

Though he is capable of switching loyalties, and his life
history attests to this fact, it is very difficult to predict his
future behavior since so much depends on his life circumstances,
One statement that can be made is that, given his personality,
it is very doubtful if he would return to his former allegiances.
But if not personally involved with someone from this agency
who can give him acceptance and support, he is likely to look
elsewhere for his need satisfactions.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Covert Action Steff

ATTENTION: Yr. Jim Anthony

SUBJECT: Completion of Training Report for QRPHONE/1,

Training Program "SHAW"
REFERENCE: Memo for Director of Training, From Chief,

Covert Action Staff, dated 23 May 1972;
Subject: “Covert Training for QRPHONE/1"

1. QRPHOHE/1 was trained covertly in New York from 22 Jue to
14 July 1972. ‘There were sixteen sessions for a total of eighty-seven

training hours.

2. his was a heppy reuion of trainee and instructor. Less then
two years ago, PHONE was given three days of reports training (Please
see Completion of Training Report dated 19 October 1970). Just as then,
FHONE was totally engrossed in every training session from the moment
of his arrival to the moment of his departure. Remembering that the
instructor does not eat lumch, FHONE brought a sandwich with him daily
end took this lunch while listening to the instructcr. Thus, every
minute of every day was made to count.

3. The only time lost was three hours for JBMINIMUM and on the
several phone calis he had to make daily to check for calls to his cover
office, then follow up with calls to those persons who had called his
office and had left messages to be called back. At the most, these calls
took half an hour. On some days, they took far less.

4, His cover organization work took up a considerable portion,
everydsy, of his free time with the result that he could not do any

casing to speak of for subsequent preparation of commo plans for exercises.

For exemple, told early on to prepare two dead drop commo plens, he
was not able to come up with anything till the last week -- end then
with only one written one and one that he revéjwed orally. As a result
he had to be given time during the training day to write reports of
his cowutersurveillance exercises and one of his agent developmental
exercises. After one such exercise, asked if he wished to teke time
out during the training day to write his report he said: "No, tonight
I will make time to write it.” And he did. And it was @ good report.

5. On each Sunday, he went out of town to visit his aged Grandmother.
le used the travel time to read tradecraft books (he read seven altogether).

done that day. At least one time, he mentioned that he did not zo

he had stated that he had meetings starting at rour-thirty that afternoon.
With all that, he nevertheless was fully alert and attentive every minute

6. In his developmental recruitment series of exercises, his 3
instructor played the role of operations officer -- and a real dunb- :
dumb he was. In such circumstances, PYONE had to do all the thinking, i i

all the planning, all the casing for meeting sites, all the analyzing, ‘ t
all the preparing and pointing for the recruitment. It was pure joy . i
to watch this man, after each meeting and egain before the next one, i i
go to work on the problem. He knew where he was, knew where he wanted a H
to go, knew how to get there. When Mr. Rod Sweet, during the critique : H
at the end of the series of exercises said: "He did a beautiful job,” ; .
PRONE had earned that accolade all by himself, The instructor's only :
contribution had been in the teaching of the subject of Agent Acquisition. ' :

7. At this point, the instructor wishes to execute a low bow in 4
the direction of Mr. Sweet: He played his agent role excellently well 3
end made the exercise a meaningful one for PHONE. ‘The three trips to
DO New York by Mr. Sweet must have been very taxing, particularly in view
of his immediately upcoming TDY trip, but they were efforts well spent.

8. No man, of course, is perfect. Each has an Achilles heel, a
wealmess, or an all-too-human trait, et the very least. Our PHONE has
bis. He has a very quick mind. He knows it. And knowing it, he relies
on it, couts on it. ‘This, in turn, leads to a small failure in self-
discipline. For example, told to write out his plan for the recruitment
pitch, he came in with six words (maybe not that many) scretched on a
3 by 5 leaf torn out of his pocket notebook. He then proceeded, from .
these few words, to rm off his plan without a single pause for en .
uh, hm, er, etc. It was as though he was reading a definition from a .
dictionary, so smoothly did his mind and thoughts run. He prepares
everything in.Bdis mind, it appears, and does not like to write out *
that which he feels he should not have to write out. While it is great
to have so facile a mind, a bit of discipline, to write out in fw
so important an act es ea recuritment pitch, might one day save grief
when an error would have been spotted had the entire plen been written
out then looked over for possible flews.

9. This small flaw, the instructor feels, accounts in considerable
measure for PHONS's failure to bring in a written dead drop plan till
the lest days of the program. PHONE felt he could just as easily report
orally. In fact, the other dead drop (he hed been asked to do two) .
on which he reported orally, he discussed as though the peper was in - . -:
front of him and he was reading from it. Nothing was missing -- area

description, access, hours of availability, the opposition, pros and
cons as to suitability -- it was all there. He just didn't like to
write out that upon which he could report orally.

10. In wri-ing reports on the two counter-surveillance exercises,
he dashed those off in jig time. No pause for thinking, no pause to

look up at the ceiling or out the window. Just straicht writing, includ-

ing paragraphing. Mind and pen were as one. Same thing for his oral
enalysis before and after each meeting -- no pause to think, to review,
to reconstruct, to remember -- just an IBM-type printout.

11. The instructor sets down this reluctance on our hero's part
to write out certain things, not to downgrade him, but to alert desk
end field officers that if they must have 2 certein report by a certain.
time, and they want it in writing, they must be firm. For exemple,
after the second meeting in the developmental series, the instructor
seid; "I must have that report first thing in the morning. Do you
want to take time out from this afternoon's training session to do it?"
And, as already reported above, PHCNE preferred to save the training
time and he answered "I will make time to write it". In this case,
time was of the essence because Mr. Sweet had to see the report before
the next meeting. To sum up this item: When PHONE feels that an oral
report is adequate he finds it a little difficult to bring himself to
find time to make a written report. Told definitely that he must write
@ report and given a deedline, he meets the deadline and the report is

everything it should be.

12. His reports on his recruitment meetings, ir. Sweet said, were
excellent. No jumping to conclusions, no padding, no misinterpretations,
no omissions.

13. ‘The surveillance team captain, reading PHONE's report on his
actions during the countersurveillance exercises, narvelled at the
completeness, total accuracy of description of the surveillants PHONE
had made, including their ages (but always made each man an inch or
two shorter than the actual height -- which PHONE edmitted he does “>
constantly), and the total recall of every move, every street crossing,
every compass direction. (In the first countersurveillance exercise,
sprung on PHONE without a moment's prior notice, he made one of his
two surveillants. In the second one, with plenty of time to prepare,
he mede all three of them. These were two different teams from the
Hew York Office of Security). Concluding his admiration of PHONE's
reporting, the surveillance team captain said to the instructor: "You
should be very proud of hin”. 4

14. In both exercises, the surveillance teams criticized the
rapidity of PHONE's movements. He walks very rapidly from place to
place, then spends time to browse in a book shop. ‘hen off again at
a@ high rate of speed to his next stop. They also criticized his looking
both ways while crossing a one way street. They felt it made him appear

tail conscious. These are a typical New Yorker's habits. ‘The instructor,

also a New Yorker, is suilty of the identical actions. We are highly

kinetic in our movements end as for looking both ways while crossing a

: one-way street, we follow the old Marine Corps adage: “There's always }

! one 8.0.B. that doesn't get the word". By sheerest coincidence, when }

i the instructor was on his way to the sefesite to deliver the surveillance 5

i team's report, he violated his own rule of looking both ways in crossing
& one-way street and was bowled over by a hippie on a loaded bike -- : :
going the wrong way. Only the large heavy film case the instructor
was carrying kept him from being knocked flat. : i

15. Nevertheless, FICHE is now fully cognizant of the appearance :
that his actions create and will watch it in the future. :

16. One last note on the counter-surveillance exercises: He
chose his positions well and he camoufleged his actions beautifully. :
Qne example: The instructor called the surveillance team for a quick
feedback on the first exercise and caught the men just as they returned
to their office. They got on different phones for a three way conversation.
1 They reported one incident as follows: “So repid were PYONE's novements, : :
: that when he met a friend of his, he hardly paused to speak with hin, i :
2 just waved him off". ‘The second surveillant: "No, it didn't look like : .
i that at all, to me, To me it looked like this Indian-leoking person
stopped PHONE and asked him for directions and PHONE gave them and just
went about his business". PHONR's om report, vhich he wrote up before i
he learned about the two different interpretations of the incident: i
"-- where I stopped a foreign-looxing man, apparently Indian in origin :
and asked hin for the Museum which I mew perfectly well is on 55th ;
‘ Street. I turned around as he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted
| the same man in the grey suit, now holding his hat in his hand”.

17. In the second exercise, there were two items of note: One,
the team was surprised to note in PHONE's report that PHONE even had
the name of the book that the surveillant picked up when he followed
PHONE into a book store. Second, when the exercise was over, the team
compared notes and decided that PHONE may have made two of them but
could not possibly have made the third man. The team captain, on reading
PHONE's report, was stunned to see that PHONE had indeed made the third
mean also, but good.

18, PHONE hed en elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop-
mental acquisition series) with Mr. Harry Webster, an instructor in the
New York office. After relating the fine job that Puioiz had done, Mr.
Webster's report concluded: "A first rate performence by PHONE, who's
_ Obviously been around -- both coverwise and for real",

19. His choice of meeting places with his agent could not be
faulted. For one, he chose an East Side restaurant (where diplomants, :
es Mr. Sweet held himself out to be, would properly be seen dining). Fad .

Yet it was far enough away from the United Nations building to lessen
the chances that PHONE himself and his putative diplomat terget would
be spotted by *riends or acquaintances. His choice for the next meeting
wes at an impressively named new restaurent near the Lincoln Center

for the Performing Arts on the West Side of town. This restaurant wes
loceted in the safesite corplex. He was thus able very smoothly to
invite his agent to the safesite from the restaurant for the recruiting
pitch.

20. He did very well in executing two recognition meetings and
two brush passes. He had no time to write his own commo exercises
(as stated, he was able to write up only one deed drop commo plan)
so he was given commo plans written up by another trainee. To give him
veriety, he was alternately the higher and the lower echelon, alternately
accepted and made the hand-off. -

21. In operational and intel reports, he did very well. He very
successfully separated the operaticnal from the intel info and the
source comments from the positive intelligence.

22. Instructor's Observation: PHONE is a proud man, both as an
Sndividual and as an operator. While he was very discreet about it,
very circumspect, he did, nevertheless, let the instructor know that
he has, on occasion been handled with something less then pure genius.
This, like the previous item, is noted not to down-grade PHONE, but to
alert both desk and field officers that this man, being very sure,
positive, definite and strong, hopes to be handled in a mamner that
would have those same words apply.

23. %In sua: A very good man.

2h, In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the training,
we would appreciate a detailed evaluetion report in July 1973 from the
field station. This report should indicate the extent to which the
training has made the treinee a more useful and effective asset and

' should evaluate the performance in each area of tradecraft in which

training was conducted; negative as well as positive comments are
solicited. The field station's report should also include the trainee's
own comments. Please ask the field station to slug the report WOMOLD/
QRPHONE/1/SHAW. Upon receipt of the report at Headquarters, please |

forward a copy to the undersigned.

‘WEWoeANDUM FOR: Chief, Covert Action Staff
SUBJECT: Beview of Project GEPHONE

1. A review in some depth of Project QRPHONE vas
conducted in January 1972 by DC/CA and me with Branch 3
personnel], with the participation of Richard Berkey
(now of Branch 4, formerly QRPRONE Case Officer at
LCOPIPIT). Attached at Tab A are the questions which
formed the basis for the review. A full reccerd of the
responses to these questions and the revicw discussion
is not practical so I have attenpted below to summarize
the general conclusions which emerged. Attached at
fab B are two charts prepared by Branch 3 for the review
plus a rough draft “CI Assessment" which they also
prepared.

2. FI_and CAL Excluding FSI Sensitive Reports,
QRPRONE dropped from 157 reports in FY 1968 to 6 reports
fn FY 1971. His FI reports have evidently not been
used as a basis for CA activities eince 1967. This
situation is apparently due to a variety of factors:
the character of the man himself, restrictions placed
@pon him, a changing political context which compotnded
tergetting difficulties, the complications of his own
security situation, and the method by which he was
handled. It was agreed that WRPHONE docs have inherent
skills which should have an application to either FI or
CA work. He is politically attuned; he writes well;
be can handle contacts in several langusges; he knows
how to move internationally; he has an engaging social
personality; he has an established (if controversial)
reputation as a left-oriented journalist/writer with
sone scholasticcredentials. The problem remains one of
focussing his talents and determining the platform fron
which he should operate.

.Aity. QRPHONE can be viewed as essentally
3. HOsobifity and has expressed a willingness to i
posses here are, however, qualifications on this. Ee :
move-smnall children and an unvitting, anti-US, white,
ha@ish wife, who would only be willing to leave her
Weland if the overt job to which QRPHGHE was going
; was clearly a atep upward in hie career.

a @. Handling. The method by which QRPHONE has been
a handled, I.e. mainly through Rodigamt (although there

ra has been direct LCPIPIT contact regently), is un~

/ nesearily cumbersome and not suited to the close consul-
tation needed to explore ORPHONE's future directions.
Having been declared to the British Services the most
secure place to meet QRPHOWE is in the UK and he should
be handled directly by an LOPIPIT officer.

&. Security. QRPHQVE cannot escape the record
of allegations that he is Agency-connected. What be can
do, hovever, is face-up to these charges, chailenge then |
and deny them. There may thus always be some clement 5
of suspicion attached to hin, but, as time passes with-
out definite proof of such a connection, its inpact on
his activities may be minimized and he may be able to
engage in effeetive work inspite of it.

6. BSub-agents. It was felt that CRPHONE ma
possibly have a flair for recruiting and handling sub-
agents. It was believed that this should be explored
and that he should be given relevant training, based in
New York. This would also provide the opportunity for
Readquarters exploration with him of his future deve lop-

7. Fature Pocus. What QRPHONE's own tho:
be on his most natural course of development age woe ee
clear. He may have an inclination toward African
Liberation Movenents~-the subject of his most. recent
wajor writing-——-but it could be questioned whether on
this or on anti~fedayeen work, there is sufficient .
Agency interest to merit such focus. He has no signifi~
cant base in the American black community (rather the
contrary) which would make him of interest to others on
this basis. His overt political orientation is described

as “radical,” but it is an intellectual "radicalien,” .
. not revolutionary. Further, he is basically a theoreti-
eian not a personal activist by nature. Be sight be
asked and might undertake an activist role-—but it is
felt that it would not sit naturally upon him and
would probably not achieve whatever access night have
been postulated. Within his theoretician, non-activist
context it was nevertheless felt that the probably-to-
be-expanded field of Chinese Communist activities in
Europe provided the focus which might most usefully be
explored. The exparsion of Chinese Communist activities
im Furope may come quite slovly but, in view of the
probable shortage of assets in this field, it was a
matter on which we should have some patience. It is
also 2 field which could be explored without QRPHONE's
needing to move. Whetker he focusses on this field or
another, however, QRPHONE needs to develop some job
or organigational) base which will make him interesting
asa target himself to those we vish to focus him on.
At the present time his cover doe: not provide a power
er influence base and he is essentially completely
dependent upon us.

8. CA Staff Termination/Redirection Res: ibility.
It was felt that in this procesa SY redirection or
QUPHGUE, CA Staff should retain responsibility for
QRPHONE. Fven if a London-based assignment did not
work out and it was decided to move QRPHONE to another
area CA Staff should keep the project during the trial
period and with this the responsibility for termination
4 the trial proved unsuccessful. If the trial was
successful, on the other hand, then we would have
discharged our responsibility for QRPHONE and could
relinquish control.

9. Some time has passed since the above discussions
took place, I am not aware of the extent to whird there
tay already have been a follow-up to them. Needless to
say, they have decided field implications in which
LCPIPIT needs to be consulted, should they be pursued.

is an occasional contributor to several magazines and newspapers.

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left, -
~ including Waoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
Q/1's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and
without posing problems for his handler. His personality is
easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not
always totally successful -- leaving us with tantalizing bits
of information and many uranswered questions -~ this is generally
due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable
to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job
as a journalist. fe has acquitted himself well both as a
representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself
has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
_ under Motivation. jy

_ ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/1’s attitude is good. He has made
‘ an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasn.

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on
which 2 goo ea as beens over e@ course of this operation.
The following points can be made on the subject of Q/l's
' motivation:

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

ae eeoeer 2 TR
sree oe

B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful,professional
organization has been enhanced in.Q/1's case by the
circumstances of his agent relationship, which require
very professional handling. Indeed Q/l has probably cone
to hold a rather glamorous “storybook” image of JKLANCE
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be :
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti- ~
JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to
accentuate the feeling on his part of _being a member of
a very il pressive outfit.

i
i
{

|
{
t

Cc. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1
has become active in at least two "causes". In both
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends
as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact
that he is an American (and does not consider himself
disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to
feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he
has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication
that he views this as “squealing" on his friends -- indeed
the contrary seems to be the case.

Lee cecteneg nee ne etek eC enh otk Bee, RM En ROR RCL Ree engernensee

LAR etn rere

E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that
Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity
of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid
him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to_
be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1
clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international
issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and
the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which
he has been able to live appeals to him.

G. In assessing the relative importance of these
several factors which make up Q/1's motivation, the under-
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more
underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and
probably play an important role in his current motivation.

I WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Q/1's wife is not witting of his

' JKLANCE affiliation.. She was allowed to believe that he was

H working indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware

| of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at

| Q/1, but as far as Q/l can determine (and this is not a subject
i on which he can come right. out and ask a direct question) she

; continues to accept the Chinese story . It should be added

i that Mrs. Q/l is British and is the holder of some rather

1 typical “left” anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should aiso be noted
that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety

of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activities is one which

Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed --
lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that

Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of

money received from Q/1's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
personality and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/1l.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing tc
accept guidance and criticism -- provided it is onstructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
m. n this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
press for all the desired details.

signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/1 is not a handling problem and there has never

+ been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1.has a good sense of personal security and his
andler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure

to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

work well for extended periods without supervision.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3

SUBJECT : Chicom Aspect of QRPHONE/1's
Operational Potential

1. In continuing ny efforts to probe operational
areas for the redirection of QRPHONE/1, I talked at
length on 3 January with his former case officer
(Mr. Richard Berkey) and received a very favorable
prognosis regarding QRPHONE/1's mobility (i.e. his
possible move to another European city or to Africa),
bis agent recruiting capability (preceded by additional
training), and the prospects of making himself attractive
to the Chicoms (again preceded by appropriate training).

2. %In pursuit of the latter item I talked at length
today with Mr. Andrew Ness, the FE Division expert on
long-range Chicom and CP penetration programs. I de-
scribed in detail QRPHONE/1's background, current status,
and the variety of plans we have in mind and received
Ness’ reactions as follows:

A. The butterfly characteristics that QRPHONE
has demonstrated thus far will never result in his
becoming of interest to either the Chicoms or the
Soviets for any operationally meaningful purpose.
While the Soviets would perhaps see him as potential
FI source, the Chicoms would not even do that. :

B. Chicom officers abroad are still totally
obsessed with Communist doctrine and its strategic
and tactical application to a degree significantly .
more zealous than their Soviet counterparts.
Therefore, in looking at potential foreign assets
the Chicoms discard persons of shallow substance as
far as their knowledge of Communism is concerned.
They are interested in only those who have a serious
intellectual understanding of Communist doctrine and
a serious revolutionary goal. The thousands of leftists
of whatever coloring floating around Europe are seen
as only of marginal use to the Chicoms and certainly
not the sort that they would take into their confidence.

| Cc. To become of long-term operational use ‘ |

i to us in the sense of exploiting his possible : i

| long-term use to the Chicoms, QRPHONE/1 should ?
i do two things: join an existing "acceptable" . oa |

i organization such as the Trotskyite Party or a . '

| black radical party and, at the same time begin !

\ a serious study of Marxist/Mavist doctrine. AS ’
| he gets into this program (preceded by some ten

{ days training and close Headquarters direction)

' he should begin. to seek out Communist intellectuals, |

' party members, leaders of radical groups, etc., to

: ask questions about the dialectic, seek additional t

i guidance, borrow books and so forth. In doing this

he will in time come into the attention of the

professional spotters the Chicoms have and begin to . i
develop the sort of bona fides that the Chicoms,

in time, will find appealing. He should also in
this period seek out Chicom officials with the

same requests for help. The key here is to
demonstrate not that QRPHONE/1 is simply sympathetic,
- with Maoism or any other Communist shading but that

i he is a dedicated serious revolutionary.

D. A quicker way to come into the Chicom spot-
light might be for QRPHONE/1 to join the Black
Panthers, the SDS or one of the other radical groups
with which the Chicoms are already known to be in
touch. He will obviously have to sweat out a period
of probation in joining any such group until he
divests himself of his tattered leftist reputation
and those JKLANCE accusations. Ness feels that a
} successful passing of this baptismal period will
depend solely on QRPHONE/1's willingness to plunge
wholeheartedly into a serious study of the terribly
boring and lengthy volumes of the dialectic. As he
demonstrates his capability to move more deeply into
this field to the satisfaction of the “spotters" he
will be accordingly provided additional help and
encouragement by Chicom contacts and officiais.

revolution. In other words the Chicoms would seé
little or no use for QRPHONE/1 operationally in

some seven to ten days with him on a concentrated program.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Covert Action Staff
SUBJECT: QRPHONE
REFERENCE:

Your Memorandum, Same Subject,
Dated 29 November 1971

~1, What follows below are some initial comments of mine on
the referent memorandum, per your request, We really feel In
Branch 3 that for a variety of reasons, we need more time to
deliberate on QRPHONE's future operational activity than the
previous two weeks, Partly this is due to extended absence by the
case officer in charge who has been plagued with a recurring _
iliness--I believe you are familiar with this. It is also in part
attributable to the Section Chief's being new to the position and
having his time absorbed by matters of current priority. So if you
don't mind, we should like to address ourselves further to this
subject following the Christmas holidays. At that time we should
like to initiate some meetings on this matter both with yourself
and with other area components inclading representatives from
Cl Staff.

2. Background: Your memo, of course, was triggered by
an earlier one of mine which proposed that CRPHONE become
operationally engaged in attempting to establish a black Communist
cell in either Paris or Rome. The purpose of this would be twofold--
namely, to exacerbate relations thereby between the Soviet Union

and mainland China through various low-key covert actlon undertakinga, |

and in the process to further enhance QRPHONE's own credentials
as a Maoist activist. This tentatlve assignment, it should be noted,
arose because Branch 3 personnel had become increasingly aware of
the possibility that QRPHONE's project status might be terminated
in the not too distant future, While it ts true that in the immediate
preceding month or so, we have benefited from his intelligence
reporting, it is all too clear that over the past two years, he has
been of diminishing utlilty to CA Staff and other area divisions, In
discussing his future with his recent case officer, Miss Chatelan,

her recommendation was that unless something could be found for him | -

in the near future, we should give serious consideration to terminating

eee eneemeerenmen ot

i

b

ened

5 ,

his services during the coming year. Thus my foregoing proposal
arose from a desire on my part not to terminate an asset of proved
capabilities without giving the agent in question suitable opportunity
to become useful once more.

3. Cl Type Review/QRPHONE Personal Security: Your memo
makes out there have been frequent security reviews of CRPHONE's

security status, and you question the efficacy of our doing still one
more. On this let me point out that in making such a security assess-
ment, we would be doing so in response to a current request by the
area divislon concerned whose cooperation we need to direct this
agent. One hardly needs stress that such a request probably should

‘be honored in the Interests of maintaining good relations even if Its

fulfillment means redundant work, But apart from this, the case
officer also informs me that the case flle does not contain any general
summary of the alleged security breaches involving QRPHONE and
their implications vis-a-vis his activitles. It ls true however that his
security status has been reviewed for each annual project review and
that assessments of his security status were made following each

“\-alleged breach, but no up-to-date summary exists. As for our own

gut feelings on his personal security, one hazards that he Is still in
pretty good shape. I agree with you that many of the past charges
leveled against him are of the same ilk as those leveled against other
leftist colleagues(who do not have any Agency association) by their
rivals, And as for the etructure of hls case officer relationship--
that is, having him hadled by a deep cover officer from an adjacent
country--this would appear to be secure in the extreme (so much

so that one would advocate that it be dropped due its operational
Inefficlency. ) .

4. Location: We tentatively agree that In all likelihood Paris
should not be the venue for our proposed operational undertaking due
the location of the Wright clan. Rome, however, might do very well.

If not Rome, perhaps you or EUR Division might suggest another
lecale. Aas for the question as to whether or not the Rome statlon would
want him permanently, only time and his own < perational success could
determine this, One hazards that if QRPHONE were able to make his
way with some good local leftists and had promise of developing some
kind of relationship with mainland China representatives, the station
tmight come to regard him as a capital asset,

SECEET

wie treme t

Sees oe

14-0000

5. Substance: You noted that ORPHONE... “cannot just
simply show up and start a leftist nuclei. . ."" Why not? Others
have, He is a well-known leftist in intellectual circles in Europe
and has written many articles in praise of Mao. This should do
for a start, As for what he might have to offer local leftists . . .
money, energy and ideas will do. A great deal of money. of course,
is unneeded, but some is. We can supply it. As for ideas and
energy, he has both. Concerning the "bullt-in jealousy, animosity,
etc." which such action would likely engender on the part of local :
slval leftists, this may or may not occur. But is this such a calamity i
¥f it should occur? Are not leftists usually fighting among themselves :
anyway? In any case, we have nothing to lose by trying to salvage :
this agent. What we have to loce by not trying is an agent asset of
proved worth.

6. Credentials: You say in effect that QRPHONE has not
been known as an activist but only as an Intellectual, (Frankly, the ;
distinction is not very important in my mind.) Be that as it may, he ,
has written many articles on leftist subjects and has talked to
innumerable leftists around Europe over the years. True, he has i
not been Involved in such actions as street demonstrations, but we :
would not llke him to be so personally involved in the future in any ,
case. What we would want him to do !s to write pamphlets, informally :
recralt associates to his group and provide a little money to the group ' :
as might be required for varlous undertakings. Aside from the :
organizing and funding, actually this is not very different from what
he has been doing--except that It will be in one place for a change.

7. Book Dispatch Sale: You may be very correct in saying
that shopping him around to European stations by book dispatch Is a
poor way to solicit useful tasks for ORPHONE. But again, I took”. oe a
: my lead from C/EUR/CA who made a request along these lines.

7 . A. Certainly sending book dispatches wouldn't hurt any. If Spence Is
willing at come future time to visit various field stations and to
attempt selling QRPHONE's services personally, we woutd be happy
to have him do so. We, of course, don't know when he will be
available to do so, and time is passing.

8. Concluding Comment: I really feel that we should relate
~ to you in some detail the success which Andy Ness once had with the
a . . kind of undertaking which we have proposed for QRPHONE. It may .
: ' interest you. On the other hand, it may be perfectly possible that : Woes

the conditions which would confront QRPHONE In say Rome. But

{£ we ars not to channel his energies in this direction, It ie Incumbent :
upon us to think of something else for him to do before we begin

thinking about writing him off. And so when you suggest that. . . :
"the first order of business is to undertake a basic assesement

of the project. . ."" Iagree. And to this end, we should like a couple

of weeks more before coming to you with some general conclusions

of ours about the current viability of thi. case and some future

alternative course of action, :

17 December 1971

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3 :
SUBJECT: Operational Redirection of QRPHONE/1 i

1. In response to your request that I examine the
QRPHONE/1 project to determine how it might best be
redirected in order to gain greater value for the time and
money involved, I have talked at some length with appro- i
priate officers in CI/SO and Africa Division. I have been
advised that the primary reasons for QRPHONE/1's dwindling
productivity are as follows: .

A. Key centers of activity of the radical left
in Europe are London, Paris, and Stockholm. For
different reasons QRPHONE/1's access in these three
capitals is either circumscribed or off target. The
British have asked that he not operate in London ,,chsoe ae
against African targets. His reputation among¢target :
groups of interest to us in Paris and Stockholm has
been so tarnished that he has not~‘tdken into their
confidence significantly enough to be of value.

.B. Although he has a multitude of contacts among
the left, virtually all are shallow, periodic, and then
very brief when they do occur. Even his correspondence
to the more important radical leaders, which used to be
quite informative, has fallen to almost nothing.

f:
t
f
i

Cc. Because his contacts are so cursory, he has
been unable to develop a close and continuing personal
relationship with any one of them in order to develop
the intimate confidence so necessary for operational
exploitation.

D. His cover has always been thin and thus has
circumstantially at least lent credence to the periodic
allegations of his being a JKLANCE agent.

ee sent oo» 7 | |

£. Close case officer direction has been made
very difficult. because of the echelons existing :
between QRPHONE/1 and LCPIPIT, coupled with. relative . t
infrequency of field case officer meetings. ;

ea caer og ent ANCE OD

F. What contacts he has within the African
target, for example, are rendered virtually useless
because his case officers are unfamiliar on < timely
basis with Africa Division requirements and also
miss valuable operational leads simply because they
do not recognize them. (This is no fault of the
ease officers because they obviously have little
opportunity to keep abreast of such requirements.)

Ce setees case menemninten ten sae ot

{ . G. The somewhat artificial nature of his trying
to portray a pro-Mao stance may help him a bit with
targets similarly inclined but renders him ineffective
with other political shadings among the left.

: 2. With all of the above in mind and without belaboring
H the history of this project, the following recommendation is '
i offered and has been concurred in informally by CI/SO and
-Africa Division officers with whom I have talked.

A. Accepting the fact that QRPHONE/1's operational : :
utility in Europe is minimal, I propose LCPIPIT be |
directed to begin making arrangements for his transfer .
PCS to Africa and, hence, his operational control ‘
transferred to Africa Division as soon as feasible.

i

dH B. From the point of view of MHCHAOS requirements
and Africa Division's own requirements, both elements

| Yelt QRPHONE/1 could best be exploited in Tanzania, pod
It is one of the two most active cities in Africa for i

| the radical left, it is a hot-bed of both Soviet and

'
w

Chicom shenanigans, and it is politically vital to
East African stability.

C. However, because of QRPHONE/1's well-known
association with two exiled Tanzanian opposition
politicians in London and current reports that these
oppositionists are plotting the overthrow of
President Nyere (perhaps with Soviet assistance), it
would be very imprudent for QRPHONE/1 to arrive bag
and baggage in Dar es Salaam in the near future.
Nyere and his police might well conclude that QRPHONE

: ; . represents the advance probe of the coup plotters and
‘ | : promptly throw him into jail. . .

De Both to give QRPHONE/1 time to cleanse his-
tattered image and because there are almost as
important operational tasks in West Africa, the idea
is to move him (1) to Nigeria or (2) to Ghana for
perhaps a year. This is to be done in concert with a
suitable strengthening of his cover (i.e. two or
three more stringerships) and a concurrent mutation
of his political posture to that of a plain old
anti-imperialist rather than the more confining
pro-Mao stance. He would be run directly by Lagos
or Accra Station against local targets but with
periodic trips to other parts of Africa for cover
as well as operational purposes. Meantime, in the
intervening months the dust may settle a bit in
Tanzania, the close association with opposition
elements would be allowed to fade and QRPHONE/1's
writings and pronouncements concerning Tanzania would
be calculatedly designed to support the Nyere government.

E. At the appropriate time, a year or so perhaps,
he then moves PCS to Tanzania.

3. %f you concur with the above, I will procede to

staff this out more formally here at Headquarters and to
advise LCPIPIT.

PART A. CHARTS REQUESTED “a

Chart ¥: For the period FY 1967 through FY 1971
provide the number of disseminated reports according to
the subject field of the report. The headings would be:
Fiseal Year, African Independance Movements, Anti-US i
Demonstrations, European Maoist Groups (etc., or whatever :
other subject fields you wish to set up).

against which covert action was in fact undertaken and . . A
give the number of QRPHONE reports which were submitted

t
. Chart II: List the specific events or organizations :|
on such events/organizations. |

1. What is the basic reason for this being a CA
Staff project (other than history)? To provide multi-
divisional tasking for FI purposes of general U.S. intelli-
gence interest? To provide CA operational information
for possible DDP use? .

2. AS regards FI reports, which have lately been
described as being of only marginal interest, the main
criticisms appear to be a lack of depth and detail.
CA Staff's counter to this has been that QRPHONE goes as
far as he can, and can go no further through elicitation.
Have these depth/detail criticisms been valid? Is our ar -
defense valid, or could he reasonably be expected to . ‘ \. -
elicit more depth and detail than he does? eo

3. If he can go no further through elicitation and
we wish to keep him on the FI path, what is implied? -

pursuit be?

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CA/B-3

sens neem eens acnemnemimemasmnat Ban PS NES ATTA

SUBJECT: QRPHONE

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum, Subject: QRPHONE
Operations in Europe, Dated 24 November
1971

1, Imade some notes in the margin of referent memorandum upon
first reading it. However, since these are too brief, I thought it best
to let you have my thoughts on this matter in fuller form,

2. As you may know, we had tried for years to give QRPHONE more
meaningful assignments, but there are certain facts about him and the
+, operation today which simply cannot be ignored. It seems to me that
@: your memorandum takes inadequate account of these factors,

. a. Security: RODIGAST's and QRPHONE's personal security
- . cannot be faulted, in my judgment. However, that has not protected
QRPHONE from accusations of being CLA, which have haunted him
throughout the years, This is such an endemic charge in the milieu in
: which he operates that I feel certain he would have had the same charges
-. 7 .. leveled at him whether or not the Ollie Harrington incident had happened

Sin Paris.

a . b. Location: Apart from the efficiency of the French police,
' there are a number of good reasons arguing against the desirability of
, QRPHONE's even going to Paris for a meeting, let alone being stationed
‘ there (e. g., protection of RODIGAST's identity, the Harrington incident,
and the location there of the Wright clan), I cannot imagine why he would
consider it, or why we should advocate it. '

A different cover for a move to Rome might be developed, - :
but not that of a Maoist developing new cells, Rome Station is glad to
have him come there and give them "grass roots" reports whenever
he visits, but would they want him permanently? ?

ce. Substance: More generally, QRPHONE cannot just simply boop.
show up and start forming nuclei -- there are already Maoist nuclei -- : }
the various Marxist-Leninist parties (miniscule though they may be)
that existed, and they continue to exist with or without Chinese help. ;
If he were to have something to offer them -- money, preferably --
they might welcome him with open arms, Otherwise he will encounter
built-in jealousy, animosity, rivalry, and a source of accusation all
over again.

dad, Credentials: As a Maoist intellectual (or an intellectual F
Maoist? ?), QRPHONE can travel all over. As a Maoist activist, he, ;
has only minimal credentials. The only group he is actively involved / : 4.
with is Manchanda's insignificant group -- and even with that he has / : 4
never carried a placard, and I doubt if he has even helped them with = / yo
making up a placard. He has helped them with their press releases, | nN 1 i
leaflets, etc. In short, with the written word, not the deed, By \ yy . i

nature -- which we must also take into consideration -- QRPHONE
is no longer a "doer" -- if he ever was one. And I doubt very much
; | that he can at this stage in his life become a "doing" radical. We would

be misusing his natural talents, which could still serve us well, in
favor of dubious undertaking.

ee Geng eee te enema

In effect, the proposal (if I read it correctly) is to have
QRPHONE develop a group which would serve to distribute anti-Soviet
material. I cannot judge if that would be worth the cost ($40, 000? ?)
to Rome, but I doubt it, I also do not know enough about the "Andy Ness"
operation to comment on that aspect, particularly as to its feasibility
in a sophisticated European community.

e. Book Dispatch Sale: Shopping him around to the European
Stations is the wrong approach, in my judgment. In the first place,
any Station likely to have a use for him is already extremely well up
on QRPHONE's background. There are only three Stations really

14-0000

POA en I age ok eee ie wae |

heavily involved in anti-CP ops (in which field I suppose this would fall),
and those three have former CI/ICG men who know QRPHONE well:
Breckenridge, Hornstein and Friend. QRPHONE has talents and abili-
ties and weaknesses which can best be explained/sold in person, not —
through dispatch. I think, that the way to do it, if at all, is by Spence
during a visit to these Stations,

necro eet an a memento,

£, "ClI-Type"' Review: A review of the file will show how often
this has been done, and how thoroughly. (I can understand Horvath
asking for a security review -- he had no background knowledge of the
operation that would have given him this information.) I do not know 1
what you now expect to find, In all frankness, and unless CI Staff feels oe
the need for yet another review and is willing to undertake it, I would ‘
consider a Staff-internal review pretty much a waste of time,

3. Having gone around this problem several times in the past Ly
several years-with CI Staff and the pertinent area divisions (as the an
files will clearly show), I am most doubtful that any of them will consider : i
QRPHONE of sufficient interest (current or potential) to pay what it
costs to maintain him, We may be able to justify it since we attempt

{as no one area division would) -~ and to some extent succeed -~ to target
him on a multi-divisional basis, In light of these considerations, and
since I have developed serious reservations on the long range viability
of this operation (in terms of the cost-effectiveness factor), I believe
that the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment of

the project. After some internal discussions, this will also, of course,
entail consultations with the CI Staff and at least three area divisions,

4. Iwill appreciate receiving your comments by mid-December.

MEMORANDUM OF MEETING
SUBJECT: QRPHONE Operations in Europe

fetal tem tee oi

;
f
;
{

1. Mr. Leo Horvath, EUR/CA, and myself briefly '
discussed prospective QRPHONE operations on 8 November. :
During the discussion I outlined to him a general proposal a
which had been bruited about during my recent TDY at !
LCPIPIT in mid-October. In substance, this proposal was :
that following QRPHONE's forthcoming trips through :
Scandinavia and Africa, he then repair to either Rome -
or Paris for an extended period of time. In either of
these locations he would then attempt to identify and
to enlist the cooperation of various unwitting contacts
in the left sector of the student and youth population,
who could assume in time the trappings of a Maoist study
group. QRPHONE would have excellent cover for doing so
inasmuch as he is an established writer of the Maoist :
stripe. His relationship with these contacts or followers
would not be set in the routine JKLANCE operational con- ee 7
text. Rather, he would guide and motivate such contacts . - ta!
as would an alleged covert representative of a Maoist oo ‘ .
group, and would claim to have been a member of a larger :
. such group say, in Britain. He would, of course, imply 1
to his followers that he is attempting to develop a : ; i
similar nucleus in (France) (Italy) or whenever, as * ie
good Communists should. :
!

2.. Operational activity would be of a twofold nature.
First, exploitation of the prospective group of Maoists
would follow along lines of a typical black Communist
cell, emulating the kind of notional movement which
Mr. Andy Ness developed in the Middle East some seven or
eight years ago. Hopefully, these unwitting followers, in
turn, would each recruit two or three other sympathizers
who over time could distribute anti-Soviet literature and
perform other low-key CA operations, as directed by the
Station, and which could be attributed to the PRC.
Presumably their actions would result in some local :
embarrassment to the USSR and the PCI. Second, QRPHONE,
himself, would no doubt enhance his own Maoist credentials--

Pe) already strong--to the point where he might well become

“~~

of focal] interest to the PRC. This could lead to 7 '
invitations to Peking (as it did in Ness's case) and

: possibly an FI operation of consequence vis-a-vis the 7 .

i China target. - °

H 3. The efficacy of the aforementioned scheme seemed fu wf.

| to pose some doubts to Mr. Horvath. On the one hand, he aati id

i did not feel that either Rome or Paris Stations had “hen ~

' sufficient case officer strength on hand to direct and »~ 164

support a tricky operation of this type which might have oe

only marginal utility, in their view. As for Paris,

: the French police, being as efficient as they are, would

: probably come upon QRPHONE's "black net" in time, and

i could conceivably pose security problems for him. As pl

an alternative, Mr. Horvath proposed that CA Staff write pol,

a general dispatch to all EUR Stations describing the het v2 “

asset and indicating that the Staff would like to see ie
greater use made of QRPHONE's capabilities on the feo &") 4

Continent. The dispatch should ask the Stations to commeit Ay
on the service that QRPHONE might provide them and suggest esa
the means for accomplishing it. Mr. Horvath also asked - j
that, prior to forwarding the dispatch, a security review 4
be conducted of this case. He did comment that, if the ‘
security review indicated no severe compromises of
QRPHONE's cover or personal security, it would be a .
pity not to make greater use of this agent's notable : Lt 4
contacts in the European leftist community. t .

4. Accordingly, I agreed with Mr. Horvath's two i |
recommendations; namely, to conduct a security review of °
the case and, subsequently, to forward a blanket dispatch ‘
to the Field, if appropriate. I mentioned that we would. : ‘
still like to raise the possibility of a black operation ;
in Paris and Rome in that dispatch and to this, Mr. Horvath
posed no objections. .

5. Granting that the CIA label is somewhat in- & :
daiscriminately used for character assassination in the ae

isn't he in fact stuck with this label and in view of aes Bi
the international character of this conspiratorial goo / Fy :

is there really much chance he will be given any signifi- a
cant information (and not deception information) by anyone EI .
who will do so because he wants the information passed ey
to CIA? “| !
6. When he was looked into in April 1968 by a aa :
Chicom official, what do we suppose to be meant by the = | ‘

7. How eagerly sought-after are travelers to China’ . I:
now-a-days? What is the forecast as to demand for such ° ‘
travelers by next summer? sf |
| 8. With a reportedly anti-US, white, British wife a
and 3 small children, how really mobile is QRPHONE in a : i ,
PCS sense? If we should move QRPHONE and family to a new ait
location for a trial period and it didn't work out, ae A to
wouldn't resettling him have considerable complications? © L an

that Rodigast was under some suspicion. QRPHONE has - a wl A at
been refused entrance at the border by the Swiss -- + Ray eas (e7 va .
authorities. Does anyone doubt that in view of the a od eal ies ‘
groups and individuals he contacts on his travels he +; ot ne pate e i
has a dossier in each of these countries?. Does anyone

doubt that in many of these dossiers the alleged CIA -

connection is recorded? In view of this, isn't it a fact :
that probably the safest place for him to be contacted :
is London, in spite of whatever tradecraft he and ann ;|
Rodigast may practice? In spite of a rapport and back- ,' ey
ground knowledge clencnts which he undoubtedly benefits , . . ‘|
from with Rodigast, are these factors worth the extra
handling complications? Doesn't this handling method jen! :
essentially double the cost of the operation? lie fe 3

12. What were the reasons for the break with "Fair i a
Play for Cuba?" the break with Verges? Does QRPHONE 5
have a power base at all among American negroes (SNCC
doesn't like him and it is recorded in the renewals ca .
blacks and revolutionaries sense that he is not "sincere")?

13. Can't we determine right here at Headquarters
the degree of interest in the Italian branch in having
a rather low-level propaganda operation involving anti-
Soviet propaganda ostensibly emanating from pro-Chicom

what is our best estimate as to the likelihood that they
will lose interest in previous and current pro-Chicom -
fringe groups?

14. Other than on the above, if we asked QRPHONE
, to become involved in depth with one of the groups he
is in touch with, wouldn't he have to act "more Royalist
than the King," and wouldn't he be the first to come
under suSpicion in case action against the group pointed
to a leak?

15. If he could not take covert action himself
through such a group to what extent are we now or
potentiaily likely to become involved with covert

action by other groups against:

““* 3. Prior to this development, JKLANCE had recoived only one report
-ftoa JAGUAR in response to various appeals anJ the submission of require-

Headquarters-supplied requirements forwarded the previous February (and

‘that the verbstin minutes of February 1970 Headquarters discussions

of-2- CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

a constitutional problen with: their responsibilities to IDEN. “The idea

. | O£ passing out political information on exiles is repulsive to him."
Pe! Ze should be noted for the record that JAGUAR itself has not given
iu such an explanation to JKLANCE, but, knowing .JAGUAR's bureaucratic

4 | position and its traditionally’ conservative role in the SMORANGE

f Gommmity, it may bo that JAGUAR in fact ‘is thus inhibited.

; “$e AS to QRPHONE/1, SMOVID on 15 June 1970 followed up his March
1970 complaints to JADAIN about QRPHONE/1's contacts with expstriates
‘in London, SHOVID expressed JAGUAR's concern about QRPIiONE/1's security
and its view that QRPHONE/1"s information was of icarginal value. SMOVID
4 emphasizing that he was expressing a view personally endorsed by

P-| SMUPSILON, outlined three possible options: withdraw QFPLONL/1 from
the country; stop running and tasking QRPHONE/1 as an agent; or have

Si JAGUAR take over the running of QKPHONE/1. (‘)RPHONE/2 subsequently was

cp] itdon,. to JELAXCE,

fastrycted to stop pursuing his SMORANGE targets.)

Pa

ee Thus JELANCE {s stymied. The question is whether there. is

anything that can be done to improve the situistion. The one new factor
in the equation that possibly could be used to reopen the discussion
«| with a view to ancliorating the situation is the fact that there now
is a different IDEN than when the February 1970 SMOTH explanation was
ptffered. Even Even though JAGUAR has not specifically given that explana-
Station, without reference to SMOTH's explana-
tion prosunably could elect.to reopen the discussion in terms of a
possible change of atmosphere since the change of IDEN. Such a dis-
€ussion at least should give an indication of whether SMOTH! s explana-
‘gion &s JAGUAR's (and JKLANCE's) major obstacle. -

ae 2 Were QRPHONB/1 permitted to resume his London contacts he
| ‘could obtain sone information of the type JKLANCE would like to get
from JAGUAR. Eut, in view of the June 1970 S{UPSILON-approved SMOVID
enarche to JADWIN, it night be unwise, for the moment at least, to
sound out JAGUAR about reactivating QRPHONE/1. he would appreciate
recoiving Lendon Station's views on this subject.

ae 8. One final point that should be noted is that McGRILLEN, in
forwarding the above-mentioned JAGUAR report on 24 December 1970, —
montioned that visiting ZIBET officer Jereny !}. FREYMARK recently had

: be @iscussed these JKLANCE require:zcnts in London with SMOVID, SMENDIVE

24 end SMEVICT end that it was McGULLEN's understanding that wit was

(| genorally agreed to limit our requests in the future to selected ~
targets on which there is evidence of coup plotting or subversion.”
McGRILLEN added that he looked forward to any followup questions based

‘Fon the tbove criteria thet Headquarters wanted the Station to submit to
1d REYMARK

és *s recollection of his talks with JAGUAR is at slight
% variance with McGRILLEN’s-eccount. FREYMARK recalls ‘that he had agreed .
4 ¢p Limit JKLANCE's future requests to those cases in which JKLANCE had
Be Roce ee interest and where there was. good reason to suspect a real
ae at to. the stability of the African country against which the London-
"1 Sased-African sight be acting. Accordingly, there is attached a select
‘(1 24st of individuals ebout whose contacts and activities JKLANCE would
like to have updated information from JAGUAR. The type of information
desire is indicated by the illustrative questions and other data
ys support of our request. Whereas we would like to have unsolicited
tee ené_sceular. seporting on these targets, we rezlize that JAGUAR is not
equipped or prepared to accept such a continuing requirenent. te believd
that tho sttached list along with the paragraph five discussion pegged
- to s- change of IDENS are good pegs for GIBSON or his designee in re-
r — the discussion with JAGUAR.

which removes the previous restrictions on his stay in Britain.
There is now no limit on the length of his stay in Britain and he
does not need to report his address, etc., to the police. Further,

he may now obtain employment in Great Britain without the need
to obtain official permission.

type color magazine distributed by twenty major newspapers in the
U.S. Also represents owner of this color magazine in other of
his business ventures in Lurope, This overt job was assumed in
December 1970. Prior to that, Q/l was the London representative
of small U.S. news service. Q/1l does free lance journalism and
is an occasional contributor to several magazines and newspapers.

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,
neluding Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
Q/1's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

OVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: International correspondent for "Sunday supplement"

ft PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and |

: without posing problems for his handler. His personality is

easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not
always totally successful ~~ leaving us with tantalizing bits
of information and many. unanswered questions -- this is generally. . ty
due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable — :
to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job
as a journalist. He has acquitted himself well both as a
representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity. bo
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and by
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself ©
has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
under Motivation.) - :

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/1's attitude is good. He has made
an effor o scharge S part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasn.

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on’

which a goo lea jas ensa over e course of this operation.
te, The following points can be made on the subject of Q/l's
tes motivation: . 3

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

ty

SECRET

re

t
ti
t

B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional
organization has been enhanced in Q/l's case by the
circumstances of his agent relationship, which require
very professional handling. Indeed. Q/1l has probably come
to hold a rather glamorous “storybook” image of JKLANCE
and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE
effort. This is a very human trait and should not be
exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti-
JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to -
accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of - .
a very impressive outfit.

¢. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1l
has become active in at least two "causes". In both
instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy
and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally
harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been
a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political
outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called
political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends
as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact
that he is an American (and does not consider himself :
disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to
feel “involved" in the currents of the radical left, he
has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE
to report on those currents. He does not give any indication
that he views this as "squealing" on his friends -- indeed
the contrary seems to be the case.

E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that
Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial
straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity
of his wife's family. JKUANCE has given him a job, paid
him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to
be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination
of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1

“clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international

issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and
the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In
short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life, which
he has been able to live appeals to him.

G. In assessing the relative importance of these
several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-
signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate
causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more
underlying. B and F have arisen since recruitment and
probably play an important role in his current motivation.

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Q/1's wife is not witting of his
JKLANCE affiliation. She was allowed to believe that he was
working indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware
of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at.

Q/1, but as far as Yl can determine (and this is not a “subject
on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she
continues to accept the Chinese story . It. ‘should be added

- that Mrs. Q/l is British and is the holder of some rather
typical "left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should.also be noted
that the relationship between the two: is. fraught with a Variety
of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject. of Q/l's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed —-
lest it lead to. acrimony. Mention should also be made that .
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of
money received from Yi's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship. . .

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
personality and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/1l.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
accept guidance and criticism -- prov.ded it is constructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
nh this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
press for all the desired detuils.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has
signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/l is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1 has a good sense of personal security and his
andier makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past ‘allegations of Oil's
iliation wit KLANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment,
add an extra dimension to Q/1's cover situation. We have no !
indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof, ;
t
|

nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of-
contacts. ‘ : so

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can
work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADHINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative
urden. fe is not overly concerned about his administrative
and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely
expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the
rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,
he can be very upset,

REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective
reporter -- both in terms of ability to elicit and writing
style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANCE: Q/1 is quite energetic and can continue
his efforts on a sustained basis. :

uae

LANGUAGES: In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French,
aTian and German. -

i
i
}
|
‘
i

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel -- and even
enjoys it:

AREA KNOWLEDGE: Q/1 is quite widely travelled in Europe and Africa
and consequently has acquitted an extensive area knowledge.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Q/1's present operating context
joes not provide an adequate basis to evaluate these talents. It
is assumed that he has a satisfactory competence in both these
areas, however.

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses,
either personal or professional which inhibit his operational
use. The existence of his “reputation” as a JKLANCE asset --
which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts
is a definite limitation on his employment.

«- CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Q/1 has mentioned to his. handler that he hopes
to be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE. He
enjoys the work and presumably the financial security. However,

14-0000
2

a

the combination of the security factors operative in this
case and the unlikelihood of Q/l's continued access to targets
of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being
regarded as a career asset,

AARON C. LAGINESTRA
FIELD CASE OFFICER

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this
agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the
Case Officer.

I doubt that we have really divined Y/1's motivations for working
with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab
we can make at this enigmatic subject.

SUBJECT:

REFERZICEs Memorandum for Director of Treining dated 28 September
1970, Attention: Chief, Covert Training/0s/T2,
Subject: Covert Training for QRPHOIS/1, Fron:
Deputy Chief, Covert Action Steff

1. QRPHONE/1 was trained covertly in New York on 14, 15, 16
October 1970. Tuere were twelve hours of training in the three sessions.

2. In eccordance with the reference training request and discussions
between the instructor and the two Case Officers, QRPHQlB/1 was given
@ concentrated dosage of reporting instruction with emphasis on spotting
and assessment reports.

3. QRPHOWE/1 is a professional writer, so there was no problen
in the writing department. The need was for channelling the writing
capebilities of this man who has been an Agent fo- five years, into
our type of reporting and to end his “stream of consciousness” style
of reporting, as one Cese Officer put it.

i

{

|

{

H

}

| k, QRPHONE/1. quite quickly got into the spirit of the training
and by the end of the first session was obviously enjoying it end
epprecieting the opportimity to learn to write our way. He pointed

- out that his big problem is having to retein substantial amoumts of
information in his head for two or three weeks, then put it all dom
the night before he meets his Case Officer. From his conversation,
it appeared that organizing a report had never occurred to hin before ,
and he several times said "no one ever told ne about this", "this is ©
the first I've learned of this, etc.” ‘hese things were said in happines.
at huving discovered ways of improving his reporting and sinulteneously
maxing his reporting less of a chore and more of a joy.

thet he hed a mental capacity to ratch both et once and there vas no

For the record we are forwarding, u/s/c, a copy of the
letter to QRPHONE/1 from his Paris lawyer which outlines the
status of QRPHONE/1's action against Jacques Verges. As Head-
quarters will recall this letter was used by QRPHONE/1 to

good advantage in conncction with his recent trip to Algiers.
The letter says, in effect, that Verges has proposed a settle-
ment of the matter and has agreed to pay this settlement in
Algerian dinars, Needless to say, QRPHONE/1 has yet to receive
payment. Nevertheless QRPHONE/1's purposes are well served by
this attestation of Verges' expressed willingness to pay, with

its implied admission of guilt!

1. At their most recent meeting QRPHONE/1 reported to RODIGAST
that he had lost his passport in Paris during his recent visit to
France. The loss occurred on 8 November in the departure lounge at
Orly Airport as QRPHONE/1 was waiting to board AP 822 for London
(leaving at 1755 hours). QRPHONE/1 had shown his passport to the im-
migration officials when he entered the lounge. He then went to the
duty free shop to purchase a bottle of Scotch and a carton of cigarettes
for his wife (she smokes Galoises). He presumes that his passport slippsf
from his pocket during the process of producing his wallet to pay for
these items. At any rate he did not discover the loss until the flight
was airborne.

t

2. QRPHONE/1 had no difficulty re-entering Britain using his Home
Office Certificate of Registration. He reported the loss to Air France
immediately but as of his meeting with RODIGAST on 13 November it had
not been located.

3. On 10 November QRPHONE/1 went to the U.S. Embassy in London
and obtained a new passport (the number of this passport is IDENTITY -
u/s/c)- -
4. We advised CHALEMSKY, of Paris Station, of this loss during

his visit to LCPIPIT on 14 November.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, CA Steff
SUBJECT: LCPIPIT Request for CRPHONE /1 Salary Increase

REFERENCE: ’ OEPA - 2122

1. The following is a breakdown of QRPHONE/I's salary history:

Starting salary, June 1965 $600 per month
1 September 1966 $700 per month
1 July 1967 $800 per month

- All of the above figures are tax free. In addition, as of 1 May 1969, Subject
was given an additional $50 per month (also tax free) as our contribution
toward some form of insurance againet the future (endowment, lump sum

_ each value, or whatever the Field and he finally selected), This appears on
the books as a salary increase. However, although to his ultimate advantage,
it does result in & small decrease in take-borne pay since @/1 ls also required
to make s contribution to the payment of the premium.

2. In addition, Q/l's MOC also provides for $10, 000 indemnification in
case of death, or payment of $600 per month up to $10, 000 to his wife In case
of his total Incapacitation or disappearance while employed by CIA. Allowance
had originally been made for this provision when he seemed to have an excellent
chance for travel to Peking; this year we included the provision as a general
benefit, not tled to any particular type of hazardous travel alone, Finally,
this year's amendment to his MOC also included a severance bonus of one
month's salary for each year of satisfactory service. We placed $3,200 ina
special escrow account to cover his previous four years’ service, and are
providing in our Project renewals for each year's required deposit to that
escrow account. Please note, however, that this benefit has not yet been
surfaced either to QRPHONE/l or to RODIGAST, by decision of LCPIPIT (a
decision which I believe was wise).

oe : 3. It le my feeling that the proposed salary Increase of $250 tax free
‘per month is way out of line. I belleve that paragraph 3 of the reference,
comparing Q/1 with a hypothetical GS-12 is a rather specious and unrealistic
argament. Q/1, although an American, is an agent, and nothing more, and es
you note in your penciled comment the question of quarters, allowances, and
periodic step Increases is not relevant. In addition, while I do not subscribe

-~ oa,

to some of the criticisms that have been leveled at his production, the fact

remains that I hove not seen any marked improvement during the past two

years in the quality of the material he provides ue. As time goes on and oe
the realistic criteria of what is dieseminable and what is not are applied an
more and more to his production, and this production in tarn remains at its

present level of superficiality, we will see lesa and less of it qualify for
dissemination, Since he Is an FI agent, this has considerable significance,
although It of course does not present the full picture of his capabilities. His
operations! intelligence has been received with mixed evaluations; usually

his initial coverage of a subject Is very well recelvei and often whets the

appetite of the recipient for more; somehow, however, that "more" never

seems to materialize -- they get more of exactly the same caliber, but

little more in terms of depth of reporting. Perhaps the fault lies in QRPHONE/1,
in which case we should realize early that what we have here is not a true

FI agent, but a sort of "operational intelligence butterfly."" Perhaps, on the

other hand, the fault lies in RODIGAST's handling of the man, not In terms of |
the personal relationship which RODIGAST has been able to bulld up with him, |
but maybe even because of that relationship. I remember when I first talked }
with RODIGAST I quickly realized that he felt he knew more than Headquarters
as to what was important for Q/1 to cover and what was not; Iam sorry I

missed RODIGAST on his TDY here and when I was In London, and that his

home leave has been postponed, for I had hoped to determine for myself

whether RODIGAST stiii feit that way. Whetever the reason, I am by no means
giving up on O/1, but will continue to try to narrow down his targets so that

he will have a fatr shake at showing what he can do when he is net allowed to ©
cover the waterfront.

4. What the above paragraph is leading up to, Is that I do not in all
honesty feel that he has done anything to really deserve a promotion, except
balld longevity since the last one, and perhaps not follow up (actively) on that
newspaper job offered to him (his preference, in any event). However, I do
realize that a man must have an Incentive, and would like to propose that we
suggest to LCPIPIT that a more realistic increase might be In the neighborhood
of $100 a month, and that the severance bonus mentioned in paragraph 2 above
might now be surfaced both to RODIGAST and to Q/1 as a new benefit.

_ Of QRPURE.

“QRPHONE/1, including discussions of his participation in the now magazino.

A new means of funding QRPHONE/1's salary is being sought to replace BIKNEE,
Which is no longer 4 functioning due to unrelated problems encountered by the

_. peincipal agent of that operation. For a review of the security implications
- of this matter (which are thought to be mjnimal) please see DIRECTOR 46178.

"ESTIMATE O? AGENT'S CONTINUED DEGREZ OF ACCESS TO TARGETS: QRPHONE/1's
‘ access tO his various targets remains substantially unchanged.

12 working days per ae

Costs Only) :
month (average) :

SUMMARY O? OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING PERIOD: Pursuant to plans
developed as a result of Marie R. LUEBBERT's TDY, QRPHONE/1 made a
continuing effort to deepen his contacts with various African person-
alities connected with the "London group". Although som? progress has
been made with persons who seem of secondary importance, QRPHONE/1 still
is unable to gain the confidence of the central characters such as Dennis
Phombeah and Oscar Kambona. a
ORPEONY‘s one week stay in the U.K. was a week of intense activity for
QRPHONE/1 and saw his local “credentials” put to a most demanding test.

QRPHONE/1 performed extremely well throughout the week. See OELA - 51297
for details. t

QRPHONE/1 has been able to monitor the activity of Belgian Communist Rene
Raindorf who is attempting to become a key figure in the Palestinian lib-
eration movement.” Sce OEPA ~ 2037, 2099 and 2123.

Following an overature from a U.S. newspaper QRPHONE/1 made a quick trip
to New York to consult with Headquarters officers regarding the impli-.

cations of this overature on his RVROCK status. See LCPIPIT 4222 and
DIRECTOR 28728 for details. . :

Through two unwitting female informants QRPHONE/1 was able to obtain re-
porting on the Algiers Cultural Pestival. See OELA ~ 51298.

QRPHONE/1 has continued his monitoring of the activity of various African
liberation movement figures in London. . —

SPECIFIC MATTERS OF OPESRATIONAL SECURITY AND COVER: QRPHONE/1's vacation
in Italy with his family produced a marked improvement in his domestic
situation - with its consequent impact upon the cover and security of the
entire operation. This remains a matter of concern and one which will be
carefully monitored.

QRPURE is now entering into a more meaningful overt correspondence with

This will have a positive impact upon QRPHONE/1's cover as a “representative

i
*'. d@eBree feasible - given his cover and the unwitting informant-type nature
of his relationship with his many contacts. OQRPHONE/1 makes every effort. -
to overcome this limitation and in this regard a plentiful supply.of’ back-
ground information greatly facilitates his clicitation of added details
from his informants. However, this limitation is one which will always

4 be with us in the caso of QRPHONE/1 and it is one which can sometimes be

i particularly frustrating. During the past quarter QRPHONE/1 has been the

2 source of 11 intelligence reports prepared Ly LCPIPIT/Reports.

i . 5S. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS LEVIED UPON AGENT FOR ENSUING PERIOD:. QRPHONE/1

4 . will make a trip to Italy in late September and early October in order to

4 survey the situation within the Italian new left/radical sector. This
trip is one which has been requested by Rone Station. (The trip will have

| been completed by the time thic report is received by liecadquarters.)

QRPHONE/1*s contact with an official of the Eritrean Liberation Front led
to a TDY by AF Division officer Geoffrey B. DRANSTON to brief LCPIPIT on
the ELP and to discuss possible operational exploitation of this contact.

QRPHONE/1°s trip to the United States has been deferred until spring 1970
by which time any possible repercussions from QRPEONY's return will be
relatively unlikely.

An effort will be made to explore the operational possibilities posed by
QRPHONE/1's existing (or potential) contacts within the Arab liberation

{
movements. Headquarters views on this matter were requested in OEPA~2044. |
"A xeescheduling of QRPHONE/1's trip to Germany has been proposed and |
HeaCquarters and Bonn have been asked for guidance/requirements. Lt |

6. AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO ASSIG:IENTS LEVIED INCLUDING MOTIVATION,
PERSONAL SECURITY, ETC.: QRPHONZ/1l‘s response to assignuents, like his
performance, continues to be enthusiastic and energetic. The comments
made in previcus quarterly reporting regarding his security and motivation
remain valid insofar as RODIGAST and LCPIPI? are able to judge.

Tcmgash

lates easily to others. This is a positive factor in his elicitation of
information from his many contacts and also makes dealing with him a
pleasant and uncomplicated experience. QRPHONE/1 accepts case officer
handling - including direction and criticism - well and in a constructive
vein. The same holds true of critique of his reporting. Please see pre-
vious reporting on this subject for added details. :
8. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, INCLUDING PROMOTIONS, TRAINING: A new means of
“ funding QRPHONE/1's salary is now being devised. ‘This has béen the subject
- . @£ several items of correspondence between Headquarters and LCPIPIT. We
‘“* plan to consult with the SGPLAG representative in Bern on this matter. .
. QRPHONE/1 has had some purely overt problems with his Chicago bank (an
apparent error in his statement, etc.) He is also being charged very high
v

service charges for the performance of routine transfers. If he is not’
able to resolve his problems with this bank it may be necessary for him
to change banks. . :

At LCPIPIT's insistance ORPHONE/1 fh has begun to invest a portion of his :
monthly salary in a repitable Mutual Pund of his choice. ‘This modest
investment program will enhance his financial security in the event of .~
termination and/or a rainy day“.

QRPREY /QRPHONE/MHPROBE/ JAGUAR
~ REFERENCES

1. As previously reported, we related to JAGUAR the incident
.in which Lionel Morrison is believed to have searched

~QRPHONE's papers while the latter was out of town.

As you know, there have been some indications:in the past

which might be taken to suggest that Morrison was a JAGUAR
contact - he works for the Daily Telegraph and seems to

be in touch with David Floyd, and on one occasion provided
QRPHONE with a report (on QRPEONY) which came almost
simultaneously from JAGUAR. Clearly, this does not add up

to much of a case, and we could hardly conceive that JAGUAR

would be involved in the harrassment of QRPHONE. Even if

there was no JAGUAR contact with Morrison, however, we felt

it might be possible that JAGUAR could add to our understanding
of this peculiar development from sources available to their

own net. JAGUAR's reply is as follows (CORONET is the agreed
crypt for QRPHONE):

‘with reference to your letter of 24th April 1969,
we have been informed by a secret and delicate source
that David M. SIBEKO, the newly appointed P.A.C. rep-
resentative in London, has recently been told by Elias
NTLOEDIBE, the P.A.C. representative in Nairobi, of the
incident of MORRISON's search of CORONET's papers.
According to Elias, MORRISON had written him a letter
in an attempt to blackmail him. Elias told SIBEKO that
what annoyed him was that MOKRISON had sent photostat
copies of Elias's own correspondence with CORONET.

"Elias went on to say he was satisfied that MORRISON
must have had covert access to CORONET's personal effects.
Elias was surprised that CORONET had not replied to letters

he had written to him about the A.N.C. and enclosing

press cuttings. He has asked SIBEKO fo find out if ;
CORONET got those letters, and to warn CORONET that . . j
MORRISON or someone acting for him has been stealing ’
mail from his (CORONET's) house. he

i
may be working for Black Power or Marxist/Leninists H
or The Telegraph or even M.1.5., and wants CORONET {
told of this.

"Elias bas written to MORRISON telling him to go to
hell and that he (Elins) and his friends will stand
by SIBEKO.

"Blias has said that he held no brief for CORONET,
but he notes that CORONET was introduced to the party
by MORRISON and that in June 1968, MORRISON wrote
an article in the Zambian Mail describing CORONET as
a great Afro/American and a great revolutionary.

“According to Elias, CORONET was then living in
London and he recalls that there was correspondence
between CORONET and MORRISON at that time; and that
CORONET used to supply MORRISON with pocket money.
SIBEKO wonders when MORRISON began to work for CIA
and infers that he and his friends should no longer
be taken in by the ‘coloureds.'

So

"In view of the delicacy of the source I should
Be grateful if the above information is not passed
on to CORONET."

2. This reply does not of course answer ail our questions,
but it does seem to be in accord with what we know of the
incident from QRPHONE. It seems reasonable to attribute
Morrison's actions to factional fending with PAC - a crossfire

1. As addressees are aware QRPHONE/] has officially been
denied entry into Switzerland since 16 December 1963. This order
was issued in connection with his employment with Identity A,
which was then receiving money from the Chinese--in violation of
Swiss neutrality. A similar order was also issued at that time
for Identity B, who was the Editor of Identity A.

2. It is now some six years later and QRPHONE/1 (at least
overtly) is employed as a legitimate journalist. He is not a
member of any group which is proscribed by the Swiss authorities--
although, of course, he maintains contact with a wide variety of
leftist individuals in pur-uit of his operational tasks. QRPHONE/1
has noted that Identity B has been allowed back into Switzerland--
in connection with his defense of Arab terrorists and feels that
iff the Swiss are willing to do this for Identity B then they should
also lift the ban on his entry into Switzerland. QRPHONE/1
obviously feels personally about this, and it may be that future
operational benefit could be gained if QRPHONE/1 were again able
to enter Switzerland.

3. We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of a report
written by QRPHONE/1 following his contact with the Swiss Embassy
in London on this matter. We are also forwarding under separate
cover a copy of the letter which he sent the Embassy in which he
formally states his request that the entry ban be lifted.

QRPHONE/1 work through the U.S. Embassy on this matter. We have
told QRPHOME/1 not to do this, but rather to deal directly with
the Swiss. If he needs certification of his status as a working
journalist we suggested that QRPHONE/1 obtain. this from the appro-

5. We presume that the Swiss Embassy in London will be
forwarding QRPHONE/1's letter to Bern. We will appreciate being
’ advised of any Swiss action, or statements, on this case which
may come to the attention of 3ern Station. Any advice which Bern
Station can offer regarding QRPHONE/1's pursuit of this matter
will be welcome.

6. Of course Bern Station should continue to be guided by
the contents of DIRECTOR-69543 in any dealings with the Swiss : i
concerning QRPHONE/1.

" @ vonthly Report/Errol S. KULPA ,
‘ACTEM REQUEED eters >

1, Attached find contact and subject reports covering
activities of KULPA during the month of January 1963. The two
outstanding characterjstics of this project remain a helter-
skelter operational pattern and the usual difficulties in
administration,

2, We can not really blame KULPA for the former, His
forte is. aoving around and being able to convince. These tvo
Qualities are rare enough not to demand in too loud a voice
for the third--serious concentration on a long range target.
It le not that KULPA lacks the professionalism, rather it is |
the tempo of his personal and professional lifo that inclines
bin to speed rather than accuracy, As last sonth was marked by
the stop and go of SCIMITAR/6, so this month was hampered by
the upcoming Congo voyage. It is not that these venture are
unimportant, it simply remains difficult to judge KULPA's
performance on cvents occuring outside our area of coapetence,

. 3. We can say nothing new or nothing untrue on the aduin-
istrative aspects of the project, The cry is the same froa

#11 small stations--why sust' so much valuable tine be spent on
tiny administrative detail. In KULPA‘'e case the matter is
porhaps compounded by his transfer from Caseablance but hia
complete file is living eviderice of the imbalance of tho outaide
staffer. In the regular four way breakdown, tne file reflects
Glsost no paper in Plans and Development, Production is not
fat, Operations ts fuller but transitory, Support is s srolien,
blistoring monster, We see no end to it, Our present agenda
for the next KULPA meeting calls for a discussion of eleven
separate administrative items, One more chestnut and we are
finished, The KULPAS of the world take precise careful case
officoring with sufficient time prior and post the meeting to
bring order‘ froa chaos, It is just this tine that a small
station lacks, 80 tar; we are glad to state, KULPA seems to be,

worth the price paid. in BY ingD ao. Law7O7 .

1. On 12 March 1969 QRPHONE/1 was granted an extension on his
British visa valid until 15 February 1970.

2. Since QRPHONE/1's file at the Home Office indicates an
interest on the part of JAGUAR in his case, JAGUAR was consulted
prior to the issuance of the extension. (This is not unusual in
the cases of persons such as QRPHONE/1 and does not necessarily
imply an “agent” status. Of course WOFIXM is not mentioned at all
in this file.) In coordination with London Station it was decided
that a re-newal of QRPHONE/1‘'s one-year visa was preferable to the
granting of permanent resident status--which would normally have
been the case. We quote from the appropriate memorandum from JAGUAR
to London Station on this matter:

“The choice was between:-

a) an extension of two months

b) an extension of one year i.e. a repeat of what
was granted to him last year

c) that his temporary residence should be made
"unconditional" which would be the normal
procedure if there were no special considerations.

Our feeling was that for QRPHONE/1's cover purposes (c)

would be undesirable; if his friends got to know of it

they might think he was being treated over-generously in
' view of his contacts with leftwing revolutionaries such

Sumvary: The First Int>raational congress of Palestine
Solidarity Coazittees in Algiers was sponsored by the
Algerian Ccmmittee of Solidarity with Palestine. About 200
dolegates, sost cf whom were western E:ropean pro-Chinese
militents, attended tho ovent. In the procdedings of the
Congress these ailitents sought to appiy the Chinese theses
of the “People’s var" to the Palestinisn struggle. The
Congress firmly backed the notion that Al Fateh and the
Palestine Liberation Orgeotzstion (PLO) vere one snd the
eame body vith Al Fatah scting as tho vanguard body for
bringing about unity emonog 211 Palestine comaando/ liberation
organizations. A aajor decision of the Congress was the
acceptance of a Palestinian proposal to create an ioformation
bureau in Algiers. The Algerians cloined that fifteca
countries wore represented. Thore was no list of delegates
ond the Algorisn hosts went out of their way to essure
enonymity among the participants. nd Summary.

eriticising the Soviet pulicien 1: the Hiddle East, it was
evident in the Congress documents that the Buropeat ailitants
Bought to do no. For example, they strongly condesaed the
United Nationa resniitions on the nettleasat of the Widdle

an acceptance ef the Al Fatah as ‘oiog the only geruine
Palestiotan reynlut.ofary organizition, and a decition to
eroate an information bureau in Asgierp which will de run

3. Tha above he p is in adtition to the rovular againistrotive midget and

the operational budget. The eduinintrative budget of 2K! billion france is

a balanced budget, with reelpts -eo watally becawe of the new taxse—exjected
without fail to equal expenditures. te rwntioned several ti es that Algeria

fe too proud to ask anyone akbe to pa, ite adsinistrative budget, lees, pa ite

already aecepted with no dirficultiss the co smnal errangee nt for the one
milion hectare of Bien Vacrnte (abendoned french lends) now bel.g put into
production. He contrasted thie with the resistance of the Buseian peasant
waleh caused the alauchéor of Ei lione of Russians from which Fustian

- agricalts e has not yt reeorered®. He feels oven if produstior an these
million ty ctares is lower than it wasund. r Yrench control, it is dafinitely
worth it, since the profits won't go to on. rich class whieh eperis the money
on tho Rivicra but will greatly boost the peasante’ otandard of Livirg.
In thie respect, he was dofinitoly rot in agreevont with Prof. I-mont's
wajor eritietccs of Algeria given on § January, and co told t e professor in
private.

6. With respect to Cubs, He was disapnointed to return hone to find thet the
missle bases did oxist. Hie uain hope in vieiting Cubo—es he told President
Kernedy quite frankly but'@ rrostly®—was to help lower tepemtures, fs had
edviced President Kennedy not to invade, andhe hed advised Castro to be more
Gioerect in acceptance of are. The end result «os not disappaintwont, however,
eings no man em be disapointed if « melear wr hae been ewided.”

J. The U.S. reaction to the Yous revolution disappointed hin also, and he felt
UhS. early estions were .ristakes. It had eppeared relations between Cairo

and Weshington were going to woll prior te the Yevcn crisis, endit hed been

@ eho to ruin good relations. U.S. reeognition of the Ropablie of Yeron
howgver was highly colosns to hin, and he feels thic «ill @ euch & retum
U.S./Caire reletions to the provio-is high plane. .

@, Wath respect to a Urited Morth Africa, he feols the tive to act is now on
e ealtural and cooncnio lewel. He feosls identics] textbooks, exchange of
teachers, cult rol excharges, lowering of frontier custom and eduinistrative
barriers, ete. will start a movecnt thich in the ond will fares constantly
greater tnity, oven if the politiclons don't really feel the tics is ripe.
Hoe feole thie és expecially true in education and the axthange of econoaic
edvanterzee, sich as procud ne clectricity from Oujda for Maria or Tleseen
instead «f fron Oran.

Ye "Upon his honor es a can* he ewore he nor any Algerian had anything to do with
tho attempted esstcsination of Bourguiba. He aleo felt sure the two Youssafiers
in Algerie, who are good friends of his, had not ing to do ith it. He felt his
friendship wit! these two pervona ucht have led to scopfekiees cuspicions that

2. Then the first editor of “Aevolution Africaine”, Jacques Kanscur = -  *
VEROES, wae replaced by Mohamed HAZBI in May 1953, bo left Algiers sad

took control of “African Revolution" in Lausacne. After two issues had . he
Deon published the connection between 1¢ and "Revolution dfricaine” was 3
eovered and "African Rovolution"” bocaze “Africa, latin Amorica, dota -

Bavolution”. In Lecenber 1963 the editorial tcard soved from Lausame to

Pario, and the publication now eppoars contkly in English and French,

Githough the two editions are not idoatical. Tis former is printed in

Sui Sverland and the latter, which catrics the title "Revolution", is printed
a Paria.

a Rovolut:

3. The Editorial “Europe too. . .” in issue Yo. 8 (December, 1963)
urged the Europoan working-olass movexent to taxe up the revolutionary
struggle. Thus “Africa, Latin Acerica, Asia Revolution” made it clear that
At intended its message to have 6 world-wide aszlication. At first, .
however, it had directed its attention to the destruction of colonialisa in
Africas and the establishment of national inte;endenco and socisliea, and
bad later scknowledgod tho logic of ite arguzente by changing ite title to
“Afrios, Latin America, Agia Bevolution™.

lee fo begin with, "Africa, Latin Azorica, Asia Rovolution” did not
Give tho impression that it was advocating any particu'sr brand of ~
Gooleliea. The Editorial on "Ideolcgy”™ in issie No. 3 acknowledged the. .
existence of various types of socialies in Africa end recognised that they } .
were based on the "profound logic of experiecse". In time, however, it-
booane increasingly srparent tkat the publication was lending ite support
to the Harxist-Loninist theory of revolution, acd the Chinese Cocmunist
iptorpretation of it. The princizal article in iesue Yo. 7 (Hoveaber, 1963)
which had the anodyne titie “Third World? Which Third World?", wae largely
@n exposition of tke Chinese Communist attitude towards the national
liberation movement, drawing material and ins;iration from the Chinese
Coamuniet Party's document "A proposal concerning the géneral line of the
Zaternationsl Communist-Movenent"., (This was the lotter, dated 14th Jime
2963, from the Contral Comnittes of the Cainsse Communist Party to the
Central Committes of the Communist Party of thé Soviet Unions it is a cajor
Gocunent in the ideological dispute between the two parties.) The article
Oontained the following quotation from the Cxinese letters

"The various types of contradictions in the contemporary world
sre centred in the vest aress of Asia, Africa and Latin Americas
. these aro ihe most vulnersble areas under inporialist rule ocd
“the stormcontros of world revolution dealing direct blows at

policive ani at tho sare iin to donigrato those Communist Partios which.
Bapported the Soviet lino, the Bditor'nl in issue Ho. & refarred-
soornfully to "tho proponente of tke ssacoful road to soolalisa™ and the
““ezuncon of the rovisionists™, and Previsinod tho ond of tha “isolation
dn which revolutionary darxists have oeen bold tocauso of tae. :
Fevislonisa of the leadorahips of the Comcunist rertios", Clearly,
therefore, "Africa, Latin Azorica, 4c14 Revolution” supports the Coinese

5. "Africa, Latin Aserica, dois aevolution” bas for tha most part wy

artiolos, end the nanue of their authors, which Lave appeared in iscues
1 <2 of “African Revolution” and issues 5 = 9 of “Africa, Latin Azerioa,
doie Revolution".

Chinese Support and Influence ‘

6. When VERGES was in Poking in tke early art of 1963, the Chinese
egresd to take out 3,000 sutscripticns to “African Revolution” and these
were in due course traneforred to “Africa, Latin dzarica, Asia Revolution”.
Tt de quite likely that this vas a form of subsidy and, initially, when
the publication sold for 58. Od., 4% was worth £750 a month. dn article in
“Woveweok" dated 9th Karck 1964 refers to a roport that the Chinese Exbassy
da Berne provided the publication with £25,000 in 1963. In addition,

esob issue has containod at loast ono full pag advortiecnont of Chinese
Cocaunist publications. In thoss cireucatances, it ie not surprising

that it has baan stotod that tha Chinosa aro in a position to control to
eoce oxtont what appoare in “Africa, Latin Amerios, 4oie Revolution” but
to clear, roliable inforcation is available tc show bow this ia dono. The
pudlication kas also had contact with the Goinuss through Abdul Rahman
Mohanoé BABU, a centor of tho Editorial Board who is row Minister for
External Affairs and Tra¢o in Zanzitar. Ho visitod China in 1960, booame
the Zast African corrsszordont of tha Suw China Nows Agency in 1961 and
went to Caina again in October 1963.

Guden Support

: oa A Spanich edition of tha publication was envissgod as early oe
May 1963 and it has baon roported that moxbers of ite ataff have been in
touch with QGuban diplomats in Duropa with « view to the latter editing the
proposed Spanish sdition. Thare ia however, no confirmation that it has
yot been published in Spanish. It cay bo that this Cuban connection was
of assiatance in providing the pictures of tho Cuban revolution which
eppoared in issus Yo. 3 (July, 1963).

tho Cozunist Splinter Grou nthe U.K.

8. By tha end of 1963, “Africa, Latin dsorica, dsis Revolution” had
established contact with the Cocmunist eplic:a group in the U.K. which .
fs sympathetic to tho Chinosa lina in tco Sino-Soviot dispute.
