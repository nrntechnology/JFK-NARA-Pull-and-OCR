Dear Mr. gaaceun :

Reference ja rnade to your current contract ‘vith the United States
Government, a9 reyresented by the Contracting Officer.

et | ee:

Arrangements have been rcently completed allowing certain
. Independent contracture of this organization to obtain sucial security vot
. credita by covering such individuals under the social security tax i
provisions applicable to employees. These arrangements also include '
‘a provision for retroactive applicability to the beginning of the : }
1965 tax year. This can be done only for reasons of security since i
. . t
{

An we

the procedure results in reducing the social security tax from the
- self-employed rate to the employee rate. For example, in January
“ of 1965 the tax rates were 5.4h and 3-5/8% respectively.

Ao a consequence thereof, exid contract is amended by deleting .
all reference to social security and by adding the following paragraph: |

md . "Effective I December 1964, social pecurity taxes will be covertly ‘
if - deducted by this organization from your compensation in the same —* 4
manner and to the same extent as vould be done If you were a Govern- . 4
ment employee. Security reasons make this procedure necesaary. Its ‘
implementation doee not imply in any manner the actual creation of an- _ 4
“ employee-employer relationship, Your legal etatus under this agree- 3
ment continues to be that of an independent contractor." \

-
If you receive or expect to receive full or partial social security.
credits from overt svurces you will so notify this organization and an
adjustmant will be made or covert deductiona discontinued, depending
upon the circumstances. Further, Uf you should subsequently receive
overt social security credits, evidence thereof will be submitted to this

organisation. Ia such’ event your covert credits will be erased and your

covert deductions retarned.

All other terme and conditions of said contract remain in full force
and effect. .
