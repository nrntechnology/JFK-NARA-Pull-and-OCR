has. becomo even more deserved, for despite the natural dis-

; of standards, and the CS is clearly better manayed because

To thia post-he has brought his depth of knowledge of things Japanese,

also brought his operational ability and his personal capability of

Operating among significant Japanese leaders, He hag been of major

value through a most difficult period of very substantial reduction

of the station's staff and the termination of many of its functions,
While Mr. Wheeler may have spent mich of his time on things
Japanese, he has also served dg Chief, Fl, for FE Division In which

Re Paragraph C = Preference for Next Assignment: : aa

1. I would like.te state that while a tour at Headquarters
shoule. be ny preference I believe that for ma to leave my cur-
rent.assignment at this time for even one year would not be in
the best intcrests of either KU:MRK or ODYOKE. Therefore, I’
requost homa leave, with approximately one monti-at Headquarters
for requested training and refresher work and one month of leavo, .

‘returning to current: assignment Jor ot least an additional two-

year tour with the provis no that after the first yx the situae
tion be reecxanined with the ultimate view of pos bly at that
point. consivoring a two-yemr tow at Headquarters.

7], ‘In’ my ‘years in n work on daprn, approximately ¢ ten of

ich hava been spent, ‘consecut. vely in Japan, I feel that I

have been able to provide a certain degree of ‘intelligence con-
tinuity which could be spoiled by a tvo-year break. Realizing

thet career-wise I should spand at least one tour at Headquarters :
