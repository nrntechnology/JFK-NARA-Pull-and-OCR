SUBJECT” : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a

Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System
' . 4

we are in the process of reviewing the exployment .

. As you may know,
all employees in the Agency to identify

history and current career field of
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the ne A.
Retirement and Disability System. In Chis process, the inttial review of
cach case is made by the individuai's Carcer Service. If the Head of his
Carcer Service nominates him for participation in the system, thts qominas
tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends fins! sctton
to me. However, if the Head of the Career Service advises that the employee
dues not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, { have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Roard.
This practice ‘has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening
process so that those employees who ac? eligible to participate in the sys-
tem may be designated participants as soon as possible,

2. In your case, the Head of your Carcet Service has advised me that
you do noc meet the requirements of HR 20-50 foc designation as a partici-
pant and IT have accordingly made the formal determination require: by the
regulation that you are not eligible for designation. From a review of your
record it. appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon
the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completins 15 years
of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum if 60 months
of qualifying service as required by regulation. My determination that you
are not eligible at this time for designation in no way atfects your current
status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nov does it preelude recon-
sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should

meet the requirements for designation in the tuture.

rt information eoncerning the rejuirements

a the CIA Retirement System, i suggest that
you read paragraph ¢ of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin.
dated 30 July 1965, entitled “Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence
Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

3}. Should you desire furthe
for designation as 2 participant i

4. tt is always possible that the records upon which the cetermination
sade in your case may have been incomplete oF inaccurate regard your actual
employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the mat. rials cited
above, you have questions regarding the determination that you ire not eligt-
ple to partictpate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact
offietals of your Career Service. They are familiar with the os ails of your
case and will gladly discuss them with yous In addition, you toy wish to dis-
cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room oy i319 Head>
quartets (extension 6001). Tf such discussions do not resolve any questions
you have regarding your eligibility, yo may request that your uv be formally
considered by the Board. However, this cequest must be made within 30-days of

the date of this memorandum,

During the wer y period, one of the Divisions of Mr. O'Connell's
directorate took on en important, added responsibility--the security
of automatic data processing, This function covers the complenity
of maintaining securily ina rapidly expanding activity replete with
serious security problems because of the severe compaction of

vt

- information resultiny from rapid advances and acceplability of

technology in the ficld of data handling, The achievements of the

Physical Security Division, the Technical Division, and the Over-
seas Security Support Division require a high degree of coordina-
tion in order to avoid contradictions detrisnental to a unified

security policy,

3. In spite of the difficulty of supervising divisions remotely
located from his office, Mr, O'Connell has applied and achieved
effective supervision, The Divisions moved forward in an

3. Mr. O'Connell, as Deputy Director of Security for F!

of three ‘large and complex divisions of this Office, In addition,
he is responsible for providing policy and technical guidance 'o
our Area Security Officers assigned to other components of the
Agency and in the field,’ Upon assuming his duties in August [%48,
Mr, O'Connell was quick to grasp the general scope and nature of
these varied and complex activi He is an alert and intelli ent
supervisor and he recommended and put into effect several s
cant personnel and organizational changes within his Directorate

all of these qualities to their maximum potential in his perforn

ordinarily capable and edfective in producing results, Conversely,
however, he presents one of the most difficult supervisory problems
in the Office because of certain personal characteristics, Idon't

he has yet gotten on top of this individual as well as he should. 1
am convinced, however, that he is fully aware of the problem and
is working hard to achiéve the proper supervisory balance, [rite
his performance, on balance, as STRONG with many outstandi:. features.

1, Mr. O'Connell has served as Chief, Executive Staff of : . ‘

this Office from 1 April 1967 to 31 March 1968, the rating period
covered by this Fitness Report.

2. Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration
and direction of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the
functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective
in directing the staff inthe formulation and implementation of basic
security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed . ‘|
diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper 7 wo
that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been . j 4
meticulous in enstiring that staff work and correspondence leaving .
this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective : out
in arranging priority action in meeting short deadlines. As the . \

i

initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence
received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in 4
applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the |
assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

i

'

3, Mr. O'Connell is a personable and articulate senior |
executive who writes particularly well. He has had extensive : as |
experience as a Security careerist, both in Headquarters and |
overseas, and his career has been marked by rather rapid advance - \
ment and a record of fine performances in positions of increasing :
responsibility. Ihave no reservations abgut rating his performance ;

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Conneh might strive
-for further improvement, I am hard put to find aay in the light of
his consistently high performance record, I do believe, however,
that Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his
enthusiasm and eager initiative which marked his performance tor
the first six months in this position, It is possible that this is due
to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more
" measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasi.: and
initiative, Nonetheless I would like to see Mr. O'Connell strive
for a better balance in these essential performance characteristics

as the Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and

Overseas Security. The rating period covers his second full year

gained added importance and increased attention during the year.

_ It encompasses an area of activity which is vitally important to

the Office of Security and the Agency as a whole, Mr, O'Connell

has given considerable attention to efforts which decrease our
vulnerability at the hands of foreign opposition as well as from
domestic efforts resulting from national unrest, Mr. O'Connell
has shown improvement in the over-all coordination of his respon-
sibilities throughout the current rating period. He supervises his
people in an effective manner and anticipates problems so as to

simplify their solutions.

_ 3, - During the previous rating period, Mr. O'Connell's
performance was considered to be STRONG with several cutstanding
features, During the year, I consider that there has been sufficient

2. Mr. O'Connell has been most effective in the administration |
and direction.of the complex and varied activities encompassed in the "
functions in the Executive Staff of this Office. He has been effective
in directing the staff in the formulation and implementation of basic
security policies and procedures. In addition, he has performed uO , ,
diligently in continuing review of the considerable volume of paper | ‘
that transits the Office of the Director of Security. He has been yd
meticulous in ensuring that staff work and correspondence leaving \
this office is up to the highest standards and has been very effective .
in arranging priority action in mecting.short deadlines, As the
initial professional recipient of the majority of correspondence
received by this Office for action, he has been very effective in
applying his knowledge of the basic organization of the Office to the
assignment of action with appropriate coordination.

4. In searching for an area where Mr. O'Connell might strive

his Consistently high performance record. 1 do belicve,. however,
that.Mr. O'Connell has lost or appears to have lost some of his
enthusiasm and cager. initiative which marked his performance for
the first six-months in this position, It is possible that this is due
to the fact that the problems we encounter today require more
measured and considered judgment as opposed to enthusiasm and
initiative, Nonetheless I would like to see Mr, O'Connell strive

iT

‘

I found the seminar “extremely informative and worthwhile. from the standpoint
of examining the historical progression of the ADP from several points of view, All
the speakers were highly qualified in their particular field and their presentations were
well prepared, All were exceptionally apt in fielding questions, : it

Mr, Bert Engelhardt, Associate Director, ADP Management Center, CSC, was
-a.gFacious.host.and-handled.. his.role.as.noderator.in.a truly. professional.manner, He |
has an engaging, friendly personality and is effectively articulate. If I were to single , Wo
“out any weakness {t would be Mr. Engelhardt's Iecture,. He spoke on the Systems |
Analyst. In his presentation he seemed not to take into consideration the professtonal |
level of the group and devoted.an inordinate amount of time on basic managerial a |
precepts. . This seemed to have an irritating effect on the participants who by virtue.

* MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT : James P. O'Connell
: Fitness Report

1, This memorandum will supplement the information contained
in Mr. Victor R. White's memorandum of 10 April 1967, since Mr.
O'Connell was reassigned to the position of Chief, Security Policy and

Executive Staff on 9 January 1967, :

: 2, This then covers the period from 9 January 1967 to 31 March
1967. During this period, Mr. O'Connell quickly justified the selection t
fcr this key position in the Office of Security and has already begun to F
demonstrate his executive talents in this position, :

3. Although the period for which he is being rated in this position
is too short to be characterized definitively or finally, I would fay that
his progress thus far justifies an unqualified rating of "Outstanding".

1, When’

Acting D/COS, He served in this capacity from early
April until his departure on 16 June 1965,

2. “within a matter of days he was performing
the. assigned duties in a superior manner. He most
certainly demonstrated sound judgment, dependability
and mature tolerance. - The latter is an essential for

the daily problems: unique to any post type service,

'3, As to his executive or leadership qualities
1 believe I can "save several paragraphs by stating
simply that within a ‘week of assuming his new assign-
ment I left on a G-day TDY¥ and within 30 days de-
parted south for over 3 weeks. and in each case departed
with absolute assurance the Station was in good hands,

and it was.

be passed to Chief, KUSODA and if appropriate a copy
