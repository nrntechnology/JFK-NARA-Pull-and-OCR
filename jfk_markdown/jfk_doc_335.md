MEMORANDUM FOR: C/LA/CAM © .

1. In a meeting with Assistant Secretary Rogers today,
he told me that he had learned from Foreign Minister Facio
that Bosch, at the time of his arrest in San Jose during the
Kissinger visit, had two recently issued passports from the...

- current Chilean government. Facio also said that 10-to 12, aC
- persons also had come into Costa Rica with Bogch but the aot
- Costa Ricans do not know who they are nor have they been ~ ms i
able to locate them. I mentioned to Rogers that a U.S. a0
. Secret Service agent had interviewed Bosch. : oe

=“... @. In view of State's interest.in this ease, I suggest
you send a cable to San Jose and try to find out the number
‘ef these Chilean passports and to whom they were. issued. __
‘Also it might be worthwhile to have a summary of what Bosch
‘and the U.S. Secret Service agent talked about.)
