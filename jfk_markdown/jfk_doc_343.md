Case 64574 - USSR External Policy - Pugwash Conferenc®
Mmich, Germany, August 1977

2. Enclosed ysu will fini a list of attendees (Enclesure A)
to the Pugwash Conference held in ixmich, Gercany, in Aucsst, and
a set of questions (Enclosure 5) prepared by the ORPA ana
at our request. Since the original list of attendees ccntained
only the last nane and first jnitial of each US participant, we
had to mike sone educated guesses as to the true identities of
many of them. As a result, do net be surprised if some ceestion
why we felt they had attended. In many cases, however, there was
no question as_to the true identity of the scurce.

2. ORPA has been quite plesscd with the renorting ©
their previous iz. 4254 result, tney have mere an
extra e:tort to write even more thought proveking require-exts.
We feel that the enclosed questicns are the best we have sent out '
to date. :

3. Responsive reporting should cite the current CISL, Objective
Ala ani EIQ 90. Ke look forward to receiving your responses. . 4

JFK MICROFILM FILE SUMMARY

SUMMARY; REEL 4, FOLDER(S) 3, CREATED 02/07/94 by ES

SUBJECT OF FOLDER :_Abram Chayes

201 NUMBER, IF ANY

INCLUSIVE DATES OF FILE MATERIAL Undated THRU APRIL 1978

RELEVANCE OR NON-RELEVANCE TO OSWALD & JFK ASSASSINATION:

Neither the information or time frame is relevant. See Summary below.

REASON OR ASSUMED REASON FOR INCLUSION IN THIS COLLECTION.

A review of the HSCA volumes did not surface an "Abram" Chayes but an "Abraham" Chayes, a legal
advisor to the State Department, who maintained that at the time Oswald received his visa to enter Russia
from the Soviet Embassy in Helsinik, normally at least 1 week would elapse between the time of a tourist's
application and the issuance of a vias. It would appear that Abram and Abraham are not identical to each
other. Betty Lichtenfeld of the HSCA reviewed the file on 17 August 1978.

SUMMARY OF INFORMATION WITHIN FILE:

Harvard Law School professor who attended a Pugwash Conference in Munich in 1977.

CIA/U. S. GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP:

None.

PAGES OF NON-JFK-RELATED MATERIAL: 8
