MEMORANDUM FORs Deputy Diroctor for Plane

SUBJECT s Beckyrouml Material for Dr. Tyson'a visit on Wodnosday,
damary 7th. .

1. TI would like the attached papers to call to your attention
the very good vork thet Dr. Tyson has done which is generally not known
here. His succussful use of enigrog in making a calm and factual pre=
Sentation to the Acerican publie of conditions Lehind the Iron Curtain
is, in my opinion, the banie on which tho Crusade for Freedom ean be run

by tho Heritage Foundation in the filture,

2. Dr. Tyson sharoa our doubta atout the Pree University in
Exile. Be agrees that the two principles upon which the University was
founded1

A. that thero wore sufflotent qualified Iron Curtain
escapees to Justify institutionalizing their education; and

B. that by creating such an inatitution for escapees an
eaprit de corps ia created, together with a dotermination
on tho ;art of tho oscaposs to serve their homelands at

dome future date

have not boen proved, ,

3. All of the evidence to prove the validity of those prinotples
is certainly not in, Tho evidenoe at hand raloes sorious doubts, and 4s

as follovas

4s Of the current 208 students of the Free University, 37
are Yugoelavs, ani 12 were born in Western Euro] can countrie .
(The high total ratio —~ almost 25% of the atudent body -- of
Xugoslav students, which is not a target. country, together with
tho non-satellite born studenta indicates an inubllity to recruit
the kinde of students the University wae intended to train.) It
should also be noted thet from the information available to us 1%
is not poseible to determine vhat proportion of those listed aa
born in target countries actually left thea before Soviet domina-~
tion. T have tne impression, which is subetantiated by the recruit-
ing miasiona of Mr. Royal Tyler throughout Europa and even Turkey,
that sultaLle candidates ara already extremely difficult to find,
Tt should be noted also that of the 64 outaldo scholarships given
to exiles in various Europsan Universities, 16 are for Yugoslavs,

B.. We have had -vartous raporte which indicate that the
morale of a mmbor of students at Strasbourg 18 not good, These
morale problema arise from a variety of reasona, smong which are:

(1) They are not antivaly certain why ‘they are there
and just what the Amerioan sponsors intend for then;

(2) They fear that after they finish their education
they will be without jobs;

(3) There has boan a steady and aystematic campaign
carried on by French Communtst ctudenta at the University
of Strasbourg to demoralize and disorgunize the FEUE student
body. In addition, several students are suspected of being
espionage agents,

4. Dr. Tyson te leaving for Europe on the 21st of Jamuary to make
a thorough investigation and evaluation of the Freo University in order to
answer these questions. We ao aiding him by having the officials of the
President's Escapes Program make available a completa inventory of escapees
who might be potential candidates for the Univoereity.

5. Dr. Tyson vas not the instigator of the proposals for a gymnasiwa
for the Froo University. Tho proposals were made and pushed by Royal Tyler
and Spencer Phenix, The handling of this matter as fur as Tyler vaa conoerned
ves another exauple of hia difficulties in dealing with Phenix for, ao finan
elal officer of NCFZ, and having no position in the separate corporation,

1. I would like to call DD/P's attention to this uncolicited
memorandun, It 13 additional evidence for my own observation made
to him orally that the work of backstopping NCFE ig being carried
forward in a manner which at least attempts to meet the challenge
of servicing the entire Agency in those aspects of NCFE work which
can be useful to the various Divisions of the Agency.

2, As he is aware, NCFE conducts an enormous amount of
research and other activity. I believe we can now say with some
certainty that this record is being put to use by Washington.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

SUBJECT: University of the Saar

1. The University of the Saar was created on 8 March 1947.
It has four facilities -~ two in Saarbrucken (Letters and Law)
and two in Hombourg (Medicine and Science), Faculty members are
French, German, Swiss, British and Saarols,

2. A number of "institutes" exist with undefined relations
to the University though financed, as is the rest of the University,
by the French Government, and include a epecial institute for
interpraters, an institute for economic science, and a European
Institute. The Support of the French Government of this University,
aside from its merits, is part of the French attempt to Europeanize
the Saar,

3. The European Institute, devoted to European unity, is a
recent creation and is largely the result of the promotions of
former Deputy, Andre Philip. It was the European Institute to
which the Herald Tribune article specifically refers,

4. The University participated extensively, especially the
European Institute, in the European Youth Campaign. Some of the
Specific activities vere as follows:

March 1952: The Campaign cooperated with the International
Institute of the University of Sarrebruck in arranging a
meeting of young professors in the Saar and another mesting
of youth leaders, both to discuss European problems, Films
were supplied by the Campaign for both these meetings.

By the end of April, 25 youth organizations (practically all)
in the Saar were associated with the Campaign, During April,
May, and June an extensive program of discussion groups was
arranged in the secondary schools throughout the Saar. These
groups were sponsored jointly by the Campaign and the youth
groups of the Saar. The groups discussed all phases of the
unity question but concentrated particularly on the Schuman

14-0000

Plan due to the economic position of the Saar in this
matter. Films and publications of the Campaign were used
in the discussions. 7000 students participated..

During June 1952, in Cooperation with the Campaign, students
and professors of the International Institute formed a
commttee along with youth leaders to discuss the particular
Problems of the Saar in a United Europe.- :

On March 27, 1952 the Campaign held a targe study group in
cooperation with the European Institute of the University

of the Saar. Students attended from Aix, Hambourg, Oxford,
Tubingen, Leyden, Nancy, Berlin and Paris. Lecturers were

provided by the Campaign,

DEPUTY DIRECTOR (PLANS)

SUBJECT: Call by Spencer Phenix on DOCI”

1, Spencer Phenix will call upon the DNCI Friday for the
purpose of taking up with hUn certain questions among which are

the following:

a. A_gymnagtua for the Strasbourg Untveratty. The history
of the gymnasium requast is ag follows:

On 8 August 1952, at a meeting of the PRC, NCFE
proposed capital expenditures of $377,500 for the
Free University in Exile, nic amount was placed in
a reserve fund along with other requested budret Ltems,
It was agreed that funds held in this reservo could be

released to NCFE by the DO/P in conjunction with the
pDp/A if in their J nt the submission of further
’ data Justified such xpendi tures.

On 17 September 1952, Spencer Phenix, for NCFE,
made a request for $47,000 to be released from the CLA-|
held reserve for the construction of a gymnasiun at the

Free University.

This request was rejected by the DD/P, He said he
would reconsider the request if further data supported

it.

On 8 October 1952, Mr. Fhenix made another request
supplying further data, This time the request was
reduced to $43,500. This request was also rejected by

the DD/P.

Pa P
to the establishment of a jymnasium and thrt his under-
Lp y . standing of the reserve fund is that when the Board of
4 ay 5 Directors of NCFE ask for the money, they recoive it at
, once. He says that there appears to be some mi. sunder-
| standing of this procedure, pointing out that tho locus
of misuncerstanding ‘Ls in and around Frank W'o office."

». The Turkish Rroadcasting Station. Mr. Phentx intends
wv to raise this question as a basle policy matter, he having been
informed by us that while there is great enthusiasm for the project
and while the State Department has set January ASth as the date by
which VOA must oither secure agreement from the Turkich Government
or withdraw itself from conzidoration, the basic policy question of
i? a whether RFE then moves in has not been definitively settled.
ay Mr. Phenix would like to know definitely now whethor, contingent
rkey, NCFR can

proceed with the buildin

rad \ upon the fallure of the Volesa to gain entry to Tu
y of a Turkish station, ‘Thio item, which

"

jwild probably be in the neighborhood of five milifon dollars, was
presented at the PRC meeting, at which time it was ayreed it would

[be considered as a separate project at a later date.

ce. The Slansky Trial. Mr. Phenix is worried about the

that this secret arrangement was made with RFE by CLA men in the

works in the Munich office, who through some mischance of

‘f
Ky ha girl who
: several years standing is still on the roles of this Ayency and draws

retirement pay, although her salary is paid by NCFE. Phenix regards

é K
this as a penetration though in fact Miss Bowen is a velued employee

of NCFE and has no contact with anyone from cla. We are trying to
regularize the situation by affording her the opportunLty of resign-
ing from the Agency or resigning from NCFE. .

e. Second Installation for Strasbourg University. The
trustees of the Free University in Exile have voted to create a
do: German-speaking free university in exile, provabiy to be located in

1. ‘At the last Project Reviow Committee meeting on NCFE, you
askad that tho State Department be consultod on policy in respect
to National Councila. A roview by State has bogun. Noantime,
however, for your information and in order to enable you to anawor
quaations which may be raised by Meacro. Dolboaro or Niller, I want
to explain to you how the to Divieion is presontly handling exile

affairs.

2. The dierieulty in this matter arises largely from the
fact that three organizations are doing the job. Stato has appar~
ently found it necessary to deal diroctly with exiles. ‘CIA area
divisions, EE and SE, also doal directly with exiles for arva:
purposes. NCFE hands out tho monoy and tries to keap thom togethor
in National Councils. Out of this triplo play a large degree of
bad feeling and mistrust has arisen betwoen CiA and State on the
one hand and NCFE on the other. State, including Wally Barbour,
and the area divisions of CIA accuse NCFE of playing personal petty
favorites and of not keeping us informed. On the other hand, coop-
eration of State and CIA witi NCFE in giving poaitivo continuing
guidance in their efforts has not been forthcoming. In the past
No coordinated attempt has beon made to give “crE high-level’
overwall policy direction. Roelaticns have been personal, casual,
uncoordinated, and somotimes confusinge :

3. We have taken the following action to try to insure
orderly efforts to fuse or coordinate the various oxile activities

gonducted by .the three organtzationas

@ This division has asked the cencerned araa divisions
to initiate plans for reorganization and wification of
each national council. ‘The resultant paper is then ©
coontinated with the proper authorities in State and a final

line is agreed upon.

%. This plan ds then communicated to NCFE and the
organization is asked for comments, ‘eriticisns and —
suggestions. : :

becomes the Poltey. directive which charts NCFEts course of
actions “

d. NCFE then informa this dtvieton of progress being
made and supposedly rejieuta authority to depart from such

completed policy papers.

To date two such policy directives havo boen written.

SUBJECT s Talk with Hr. Robart Lang

1. I spent an hour and o quarter in New York on Friday,  .
1k Novenber, with Hr. Robert Lang of Radio Free Europea. Tho major
portion of this time was devoted to a briefing by Lang of tho NCFE
structure and the position which RFE occuplos in it, includin: the
philosophy of RFE operations, Lang gave an fapressive performance
and struck ma on such short acquaintanco os an individual of ability,
Judgmant, and energy.

2. Mr. Lang made quite a point of tho fact that his opuration
Anside NCFE Lo virtually independent. He Intimted that he receives
no guidance from the Presidont or other officers and has exponded
conaiderable effort;in the past seoin: to 1t that an dron curtain ia.
kopt between RFE and the top command of ICFE. Ho said that if RFE
had not developed and expanded according to a philosophy which it
itself had originated, it would haw got nownere and vould still be
frustrated by vhot he kept referring to as thn "old State Department
line" as exemplified by the views of Deitt loole, Fred Dolbeare,
and others. He then pointed out that.ho had received virtually no
guidance, policy or otherwise, from this orvanization. Also he
claimed to suffer from lack of contact with us. iio statod that when
ho saw Mr. Dulles o week or 50 ago, it was tho first timo he had .
talked to anyone in authority bere in auny a moon. As far ag
Kr. fraden and co:spany are concerned, be said that they dealt largely
with Admiral ittller and his immediate staff. It was cloar that ho
would prefer to deal directly with Washington. He also feols in-
hibited by the fact that he has to eajolo Admiral [iller into per=
misaion to como to tbiashington. i:0 cited as evidence an incident re-
cently wien he felt obliged to ask a friend in the State Departuent to
intercode with adatral Miller to Perait b him 2) como down hore for

consultation.

3. There was nothing hitter or frustrated in Hr. Lang's re-
marks, Father he struck mo ag an individual who was discussing the

facts of life, be Miat they may.

1. This memorandum will record the understanding arrived at
din a conversation todsvy with Colonel Edwards, Chief of 1%5, and
reported orally to Mr. Durkee by me. Admiral Miller telephoned
me today with an urgent request that we give our authorization and
approval to the use of Mr. Stowe for a further period of 81x months
in the capacity of a consultant to PFE and not us a reguler employee,
Thies was the same basis »%. was finally approved for the ftret perica
of eix months which 19 about to expire.

2, In discussing this matter with Colonel Edwards 1 refreshed
hie recollection as to certain features of tho original arrangement, -
including the fact that Stowe is an ¢x;remely capable individual
who has attracted other good people, notably Russell Hill, into the
effort, and who has no gerious security rapo against him. (#4 is
not regarded as a loyalty or eccurity risk bul rather as a eource
of pousible embarrassment in view of certain earlier writinys of his.)
Admiral Miller informed se and I passed on to Colonel Edwardz the
fact that there have teen no questions:or flurries of any hind
concerning Stowe and the further fact that he has been dotrg @ very
effective. job. Colonel 2éwerds approved from a security standpoint
the continuation of-Mr. Stowe as a consultant to NFEZ for « further

period of aix months, :

EEVORAUDUM FOR: DEPUTY DEPECIOR OF CENTRAL INTERLICENCE

SUBJECT: Conversation with Mr. Jan Nowak

lL. Ab your request, I nad a conversation today wil!
Nowak, head of the Polish radio desk of KE in Kunich.
that you did not get to see hin. Cur conversation reminded me that ~
our work is terribly important, wiiich is a nice reminder on a busy
afternoon.

2. I say "important" because Nowak reviexed with me the letters

he had received fro listenars in Poland and these, tozcther with nis
own enormous enthusiasm for the work he is doing, reminded:me that our
long days in Washington have an efloct on tie lives and hopes of people
far away. Nowak, wio was in the’ Polish resistance during the war and
on one of his three escapes from Poland at one time spent several
ks in Switzerland where he had made contact with your representatives,
later worked for the 35C and he pointed out that at no time during the
war was he given to feel ty the 23C the sense of responsibility and

ission whiea he fecls in his job in RFE. He said he was told wien
Re was brought to RFE that the responsibility for the programs was his

ad that if at any time prograns went on the air wich wer: irresponsible,’
then he would Lose his job Ho says that «nen he has questions which
he thinks might influcnes United States policy, he confers beforehand
with Griffith and the Anericans in Nunica, and sometimes arzuments ensue,
but he feels, and I am certain he feels sincerely, that ho has an equal
share with Americans in a great effort to carry the tr vath back hone.

I say "terribly" important because Nowak, like other exiles,
out loud how long our work can continue to have an impact. He
mself convinced that every Polish soldier is a potenvial ally of
ast but ne wonders, and makes his listener wonder, how long we can
axcect this sympathy among a rising generation for which the past is

nexorably fading.

he Nowak made one point whica I an sure he intended for your
ears, that ne was afraid that "certain peovle in Germany" 4 Who ‘had
contacts into Poland might lead nis friends benind the Cu btain to

betray themselves unnecessarily and tragicaliy. He said that he had
heard that the people had promoted beni: Curtain a wiispering
campaign among tne Poles at tio time of the recent elections to the
effect that the elections wera to be postns: He seemed to think
this an unnecessary rick for tix who toox 7 in it. He alse said
that he had been anprozened by thesa same fp: who asked him to urge
the Poles by broadcast to eross out the ne he Communist candi-
dates when they voted. He learned only later, %¢ said, that the system
of voting at the lass tion was sucn i order to cross out
candidates it was nece ry to step out of waliot box and co it in
the open before witnesses. He had in any event refused such cugsestions.
I got the impression at he feels sono of cur people are a litrle

SUBJECT? | pp/P'e Kenorandun to you 30 October 1952 entitlod,
oo 7 ®National Comaittee for Free Lurope, Ri, and Rolated
Mattere”

1. You will be interested to know, I an sure, that itr. Wiener's friend,
Mr. Georeseu, hag recently been most helpfl. ‘Through his offorts and the
cooperation of Jim Pekich of Sz European Divislon, I believe that HC7E 1s on
the threshold of a unified Rumanian National Council. :

2. I'm in entire agreemant also with Mr. Qeorrescu's obsorvation on
the personnel soteup within NCFE. As you know, Hire Dolbeare is concerned
about his role. le is the first to admit that his strength is ebbing, and
that he should retire. I think it mist be arreed also that tir. Lelbeare has’
dona a splendid job, a job that wovld have beon, and will still be,
for o man in tho prine of life. .

I have discussed this problem in confidence with Francie Be Stevens.
As a result of my inquiries about a possible successor to Mr. Dolbearo, Hre
Stevens suggests that Hr. Nathaniol. Penistone avis io a person erirently
qualified to do this job. I would to intercated in knowing whether Ere
uisner knows thie man. :

3. I believe also, Hr. Georgescu's misgivings about Mr. Yarrow aro woll-
fourded. In the last two months, Mr. Yarrow has teken an increasingly prene
{nent position in Mr. Dolbeare's Division, as @ result of Mr. Lolbcare's
physical inability to do a Ml time job. lire Yarrow is blunt, and inclined
to be dictatorial. He has a preditection for direct action in situations
that rightly call for finesse and caroful development. For these reasons,

{n addition to the fact that he is of Russian extraction and. speaks witha.
heavy accent, I om convinced that he should -not replace Mrs Polbeares In
py opinion, under the right Leadership, Mr. Yarrow could wontinue to make a
valustle contribution to WCFE's dealings with emigres as an adminiatratore

I believe that such o solution ig politically possible, for NCFE
4n this phase of its activities is going through a period of groping and
painful reorientation. TI hope that the start wo have made in working out a
re-statement and a. re-direction of activities within Liviaion of Emigre Re-
Jatiens will provide a program of positive projects which will supply anmund=
tion for psycholorical warfare, beth behind the Iron Curtain and in the Free
World. Such a progran will call for.an efficient adminietrator versed in
exile affairs e= a position for which re Yarrow ia well qualified. -Under
the political leadership of a person of Fr, caviest caliber, for direct dealings ©
with, exigres, I feel that the Livision of Enigre Relations will be able to
clear up preasnt inefficiencies and contribute effectively to NCFE's ove

Analyeis of Nemorandua Mr. Creighton Seott

The following momorandm, I balieva, discussse most of the.
points raised by Hr. Scott. .

1. Scripte prepared in Munich are almost never reed by Anericana
before broadcant.elthourh the goneral conten’ of aach broadcast is
agreed upon in programing conferaicos botwean tho Asvrican and exile
atatfe. ‘fhe reavoens why the broadcasts aro not real v Anori cans
before they go on the air ae aa fal tows:

@ Because the natural inclination of Avwricans ie to-
change tho troadceats, and such changes, 2FF officials feal,
are likely to.lessen the ‘“ganulno® quality of axile broad.
casts for the iinteners.

db Bocmuce the exiles foo thanselves to bo patriots
working for thetr countries, ond the sutmission of scripts
to Anocricann bafore they are broedcast would ba regarded by
the oxtlos as casting doubt upon their sllegtance and fervor.

tha American staff bolieves that it can exarcios policy control ty
sugrestions during progran discus:dons rather than by making dole-
thong and corrections in the ecripty thaisalves.

2. During ny trip to urope in Juney I asked Hr. We 4. Griffith,
Political Advisor for HIF, to institute the service of remlarly

” translating the most sensitive ifr broadcasts after tie fact. Ha

hao comlied with thie request and (lA now recaives Fnglia: trang-

Jations of Munich scripts within a month after broadcast. CIA also
receives an imuediate telotypo smery of all Kunici broadcasts, ap
woll as a weekly consolidated rumiary of all brosdcasts. fo provide
for imnediate English tranalation of al) AFF programs after tio fact
would require an enormous ataff of translators. .

3. No doubt RFC hae made tie afstakes kr. Scott mentions in
comeetion with the items about the woalmess of tie {ren Curtain and
tho ease of crossing it, and te Czechoslovakian curroney devaluation.
On the Mrat point, Mr. Scott’s dates are in error, for fib did not
goon the alr wntil July |:, 1950, Assuning taist ne means that such
broedcasts were made from that date until April 1951, it sauld be:
noted that this was the very beriming of Res waen all of its broad-

charitable orranization, attempting to influence
legislation and;

b. The political implications are liable to be an
embarrassment for CIA.

4.e Apparently, NCFE is making this prezentation in the hopes
of receiving wide publicity so they will ke in a position to say to
the emigrees with whom they deal, "lock what we are trying to do for

you.

‘J. The National Comnittes for a Froo “uropo ta the reservoir of
a groat woalth of intelligence i:formation, particularly in tho field
of psychological warfare, A four-day ourvey of the NcFs conductod by
an OLS cave offiour indicated that three oF: components = tho Reccarch

Radio Free Europe « can maxo a very valuablo contribution to the opora~
tional intelligence required by tha D/P offices.

2. It 4s the purpose of thiy memoraoncum to suggest a proceture for
the most offoctive use of the NCr+ intelligence potential. The most
practical approach seem to be ae follows:

a. At this tine it doen not apjear necossary to establish a
continuous flow of ruw ani finished intulligence from the CFE
to the DD/P offices, Rather, we would likes to uso NCFE facilities.
whenever individual cases indicate that such action is advisable,

b. We would like to maintain a direct relutionship with tho
NCFis Yor the purzose of onlisting ita support in the wore on our
individual cases. When tho naturo of the caso indicates that the
NCFS can maxe a valuable contribution to it, we could maxe arrangzo=
ments through tho @hief of I0/TONIC, to make direct contact with
one of the security-cleared NCP3 officers. A permanontly-designated
OLS case officer (A. Snatton and/or it. Knoepfmacher) would then
procesd to New York to discuss the substantive resaarch probloma
in the NCFé and reach an agruecent on the scope of NCFé. support.

3. It is recognised that the final authority on all contacts with
the NCFS rests with the Chief of I0/TOMIC, anu that tho latter may direct
and linit such contacts whenev:r he desires. i. ;

by a spectal. staff which has at ite digosai a -furspean-wido news-—

b. State Departuant overnight policy guidances aro regularly

2. Guidance papers from PY are dispatcned as coon as they are
recelvod. . Por instance, Special Guidanes on Eactariological Warfare,
dated August 7, 1952, and Weekly Propaganda Guidance Ho. 9, dated
August 3, 1952, were sent on August Ll. - a .

with MMC officials last May, ‘Thely observations are contained in
the following quotations from their lotters to this Divisions

1. In view of tho constucrable length of tino since RCIE ononed
neyotiations for Kumactan refuyeo unity and subseqvont, developments, a
reappraisal of tie oltuation and a delincation of final action are required.

2. It is evident that expression of NCFE intorest in the Counetl of.
Political barties (actually 4t has been directed priaarily toward tho
National Foaanut Farty) haa had the desired effect on the two refuree proupo
in the United States, by ratein: the apecter of-a third force developing
and being reco;nised by tha smericans. It has also mode tho Kin: ovare of ©
tho earicusness with wiloh the Americana re,ard the divigion. between tho —
two rroups. Further, it haa incited the Iron “uaid to adopt a "denocratic”
facade in the hope, pertasa, of fitting uventually into tho resulting
organization. However, in apite of the success of tho mancuver, further
oncovrarerent of the CoP? and the HF could well prove danverous to our
overall objective of unifyiny: the refurees, by addin fuel to their ciffers

encase

3. Caroful consideration haa becn given to the various worthwhile
proposala and counter proposals waiéh xcre advanced in the course of the
recent discussions. I[t io hoped,.in tits connection, that the l'Cs= has
made it ontirely clear to all the participants that thig series of dis~
cussions was undertaken purciy to explore the posalnilitius for arcreanent
in concert with the refugces theayelves, and thet alter hearine all sides

ef the question, tho NCiE will present for their consideration a "packarze®

propogal, on the basis of which finel azree:ent should be reached. lt Le
believed that the revision of the orijinal plan, set forth bolow and
embodying certain features witch hava developed in the covrse of the last
threo months, can provide a solution accontable both to this orcanization
and to the reficees. (peraticnal considerations, the desirability of
maintaining a reasonable degree of control, the necessity: for taking into
account. the refu-ee concept of democratic procecures, as well as the fim
stand on aise ty-en by the Rumanian National Committee, these are all
important factors affecting the provles. The final organisation should
bo enall enouk to control, sufficiently selective to attract prominent
exiles, inclusive onoush co contain the rank and file, and of on optiaun

aise to carry out ite functions.effectively.

ye An orzanizational form of a large passive Council, to wileh all
Rumanians who meet certain qualifications could belong, but with all action
vested in a crall Fxecctive Comittee, offers a practical way to oatiofy
both U. £. and refuzee roqulrenonts.. The name of this overall organization
should be the Rumanian Hational Comittee" cince this would provide -a sense

~ of contimiity ‘and would Yaeilitale acceptance of tha proposal by Vieolanu

National Conmittee. into the Executive Comittee of apnroxinately twenty
persons. Heaberaitp in tho Couricll would be extended to the rank and fllo

by means of letters anncuncing the new orpwiization and inviting perttetpatlones
The "Council" of the Miianion National Comaittee would incluco mimbors from
all eoumtries and would not meet in sescion. iadoscu should be dealsnated
honorary president of the Council. The executive Comittee would be tho
functisnal unit of the orcanization. It Would appoint sub-comisnions and

the 10th of September.

The following 15 a muaorandua of my conversation with
Admiral ler in Eow York on Wednosday, September 10th. I would
like to preface this account with the observation that Admiral Miller
seems to be in a hiphly emotionnl otate and renerally suspicious. of
those around him.

(1) Larry detoufville _

Admiral Uiller reported his meetings with Larry deNeuiville
in Paris and indicated a difference in his projectod use of Larry
deNeufville and that onvisagod by deNeufville, which Admiral Miller

- presumed representod CIA's interesta, Hiller proposes to uso

deNeufville as one of u three man brvin trust, one of whon is Louls
Gallantier and the other is still unnamed. Ho mentioned that he. had

- originally considered -delicufville as an aide in adainistrative matters
but. had been informed that deNeufville was not oquipped for such duties,

(2) “oa

Admiral Willer indicated that RFE was having difficulties with
VOA, especially with the new Information Intelligence Unit created by
the Stata Department, under the direction of Donald Shea, to provide
information for VGA's broadcasta to the Iron Curtain countries, Those
difficulties included the preventing of RFE's information people from
interviewing oscapses.

(3) Information Service — Leland Stowe

Admiral Willer indicated that he was more than satisfied with
Leland Stowe'e activities, and that with the excestion of RF corres-
pondents in London and Paris, they were satisfied with present personnel,
He also stated that Russell Ili] had becoze RFE correspondent in Germany,
He further indicated thet he will xake every effort to kecp Leland Stowe

Executive Board 1s having lunch dn Washington with Allen

I am gure that policies will come up for discussicn. .
Happily, everything seems to be sailing along in good
shape. .

I checked down there regarding any taboo con-
cerning your help on the Crusade for Frecdom campaign. I
think there was a misunderstanding here. They have no
thought of providing a complete tahoo, ‘Their thought was
that all other operation should not stop and your time be
devoted wholly to the Crusade, -

Actually, we will call upon you for very little
help. When Dick Walsh comes out to talk with you within
the next ten days, he will give you a complete fill-in on
what assistance we would like to have. I am sure you will
have no-trouble in giving us this assistance,

With regard to the wording of the language by
which we transmit the money to you -- I am going to try
to get a Board Meeting together on Tuesday at which time
the necessary action will be taken to clear our forward-

MEMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR UF CENTHAL INTELLIGENCE
SUBJECTs NCFE-CIA HELATIONS
1. When this Division was delegated the responsibility of
‘ conducting CIA relations with NCFE it was immediately apparent that
, a variety of problems existed which made effective action on the
part of IO Division difficult if not impossible. ; These difficulties
may be yenorally summarized as follows: ;

. (1) ‘Satisfactory mechanical procedures to provide

: oo information to CIA and to insure effective
cooperation and coordination of activities by :

CIA and NCFE did not exist. This was trie not
only in financial matters,such as the orderly
submission of budgets and financial reporting,

as well as security, but was also true of attexpts
to give NCFE policy guidance and to insure that
NCFE's activities did not compromise CIA
operational-eetivities.

(2) The attitude of the responsible officials of NCFE
vas one largely of non-cooperation in terms of NCFE
and CIA efforts being joint to achieve the same
objective, Indeed NCFE's attitude was that they are
@ separate organization with the responsibilities
of a corporation in the State of New York asst that
the role of CIA's representatives in dealing with

; them was one of being their salesmen rather than
partrers af bade Heed Genel Otlivintetn be:

. OF ea Aad forte tee” | thew Mipsve hebolee, z

14-00000

Q) NCFi has not only failed to provide information
about its activities, but had generally expanded
its Felations with government agencies in an So
effort to play one agency ‘againat another end,
indeed, in many cases play tho personnel of one
: agency dgainat other personnel in that agency, A
general feeling of suspicion and distrust provaded
CIAta relationships wth NCFE.
i oo 2. In a® attempt to properly discharged its responsibilities
Io Division has attempted to solve the above problems by re) preparing
an agreement or directive which xtates sets out the Joint responsibilities
of CIA and NCFE and “€) which clearly states NCFE's duties and responsibilités
to this Agency. To implement this agreement IO Division has, or is in the
process of, creating orderly procedures by which this agreement will be put

into effect. . . .
3. I£ 10 Division is to suceed in its task, which in our opinion

is well begun, two conditions are inourcopinéen essential:
(1) That there be a single point of liaison between NCFE
and CIA and that CIA act as the sole official governmental
liaison ‘with NCFE. It should be said that this does not
mean that officials ‘of NCFE will not consult with higher
authorities ‘in cla, but that when they do, those
responsible in 10 Division will be fully informed.
* (2) That: NCFE clearly understende with whom they are to deal in
oO - CIA and that those with hon ‘they deal on a regular basis

are responsible officials entitled to respect as such—

MPMORANDU FOR: DEPUTY ULRECTOR OF Ch TRAL INTFILIO ax

PROBLEM

It ie likely that at a mooting you will hold Monday, 4 August,
with members of tho Board: of Dircctara of the National Qoarittoee for
a Froo Europe, these Directors will maintain they do no® wish to olgn
or to accept a dirootive andfor agreement as to relations betweon
NCFE and CIA, which has bee approved by the (IA acministrative otaff
and the International Organisations Division of CLA.

DISCUSSION

At the tino: responsibility for CIA doalings with NOSES vas trans-
ferred to the 10 Division, a survey was undortaken by this vision
with the help of the CIA acninistrative ataff under fr. bolf. Tho
following was found to bo the status of relations bstesen GA and

NCFEs
1. Budget and Financlal Relations.

a. No orderly subsssion of budgatary requirements on the
part of NCFE has over been established or practiced. For example,
the CIA approved budget for tho fiseal yoar 1942 vas substantially
different than the budget upon which NCFE based its activitics.
Bad cummuniscation has oxtsted.

b. CLA has mot exercised any form of contrsl over NCFE
expenditures after initial approval. for exanpie, NCYE hao been
free to match funds allocated for one project to some new
project or to pay for extending an old one wthont Derther
reforence to GA. © : :

0. Monies raised by NCFE through the Crusade for Freodon
or monies advanced by CLA and unspent at the ead of the Msoal
year have not been considered in the granting of funds yor 4

new fiscal year.

14-0000

d. Whon budgets nave been presented by NCFF, they have
not boon presented with reazonahla tioroughness or accuracy
nor havo they indleatod expenditures Wiich aro masonally
certain and those widch are projections of possible activities
for wateh NCFE has nevertheless aaked for. funds. . r .

e. In certain instances, teas ‘grants to certain national,
councils, NCFE makes expenditures for witch thorn io no adequate
accounting to Nort and on which the Comailttee has had little
or no information on how the money is spant.

2. Financtal Reportds

a tla unquestioned that tho internal bueiness and-
asocounting proceduma of 1 arn excollent. Howuver, adequa ta
financial infomnation has not been presented to CIA.

>. Security.

Ag the rocont case of Leland Stow indloaton, RCFE haa
disregarded essential gecurity oonsiderations in the hiring of
personnel. Neither the Socurity Off.cor, CIA, nor en other
branch or component of CIA, has anything but oxtronely inadeo
quate Information as to who ia on the NCFE payroll.

ce. Policy Control.

In its relations witi omig¢roa throurh ite National
Counciis Division and in its radio broadcasts through RFF,
NCFE has in many casos not received adequate guidance from CLA
and the State Department and in some instances not followed
tho guidance provided. CfA is seldom infomed by NCFE of its
proposed activities other than in its over-all budgetary
presentation,

d. Qoordination of CIA Activities with NCFT.

NCFE's activities in radio broadcasting, which account
for throo-quarters of its yearly budget, ore almost entirely
transferred overseas. Tho action of its 100 or mre overscas —
personnal often cut across Ciits own field operations. NCFE
has not accepted coordination in this Meld.

3. 19 Division and Adcinistrative Staff Proposed Actions to
Solve These Dirricuities. _

Staff has prepared a‘ me:orandum of agreemant to sarve ag a guide in

2. In general, tho fundamental defect in the relationship is that

of CIA for the policies, financial administraticn, and security aspects

led, the following are cited: (here should be discussed illustrations of

specific problems such ag those in your para. a,)

of relations between NCFE and CIA. Thes se definitions and proced: :res have

MFMORANDUM FOR: DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE —

SUBJECT: Crusade for Freedom

"1, Admiral. Miller will call upon the DOCI soon to request
more funds for the Crusade for Freedom. At the prosent rate of
expenditure, funds will run out on 31 December, :

2. $488,992 was budgeted for the Crusade this year, We

have told Admiral Miller that since the Crusade was unable to

live within this budget, we were certain that the Agency would

appropriate mre money to wind it up, although we have explained

that his request was embarrassing because the PRC had expressly.
approved $445,991 instead of a Yarger amount in tho boliof that
less money. should be expended this year. We have naked Admiral
Miller to provide us with a financial statement of the Crusade

cost to date as well as a breakdown of the further amount needed.. -

‘ .
3. The Crusade this year has so far cost only a quarter of
last.year's expenditure and half of the amount exponded in 1950,
Receipts are up, 140% over last year at this date. On the whole,
a much better job has teen done to date than w antlclpated e-=
and purely in terms of the amount raised the performance has.

been superior,

lh. There is a good deal of gossip about the use of Crusade
funds and 1. think you should be acquainted with it. Because the
Crusade is a rather public enterprise, the gossip has occasionally
been sounded not only within NCFE and this Agency but also among
“seml-witting” private citizens who have been enlisted for shorte
term fund-raising on an unpaid basis. The gossip is that a good
deal of money has found its way into the private hands of local
Crusade chairmen and workers. In one instance, it is said, -
involving a local chairman in Minnesota, the amount which reached
private hands was enough to build a new home. Another story I have
heard repeated by different people on different occasions is that
in the state of Nevada and ‘certain other locales no money received
by fund-raising chairmen last year was ever tiirned in to Head=
quarters, and no report ever made. Another item which some

14-0000

of the people in the New York office talk about ia the payment of
$37,500 to Fred C, Smith, who worked for approximately one month
in drawing up a Dimes for Freedom campaign which, as you recall,

.was rejected as a basis for this year's campaign.

S. No accounting of Crusade funds oxpenied in the field has
ever been made, and in a fund-raising campaign it 1s perhaps
impossible to do so. Nevertheless, records lhvolving payments
for expense money to private citizens ongaged.for the duration of
the campaign are chaotic. You will recall that Spencer Phenix,
Treasurer of NCFE, refuses to have anything to do with expenditures

for the Crusada,

6, Since we are winding up the Crusade thia year and will
attempt to-place it ‘on a more reliable basis through the Heritage
Foundation, I augzest that you assure Admiral Miller that funds
sufficient to wind up the Crusade will be forthcoming and that. you
Anstruct the 19 Division’ to expedite a project granting these -
funds, I further suggest that in view of the allegations above,
which I repeat for your private background information, you keep the
position of tha Agency faultless by requesting from Admiral Miller

“a budget in as och detail as possible for the amount necessary to
‘liquidate the Crusade.

- tho concept of Mnancial control contenplated in the budyot soctlon of tho
Agroomant. wo noted that the Agcncy must have confidence that tho propraas

of the various TONIC divisions arm carricd out to the appro:dmato oxtent
proposed-in the Apency approved budczet since other Ayency plans must be
synchronized harmoniously with TUNTC's approved prograa., Accordingly, tho
principle of establishing an expenditure coiling for oach of the TOUIC”

divisions is regerdod by tre Acency as fundamental with which intor-divleton

transfers without Agency approval, vould be incompatible, We assured the
Prosicent it pocitivoly was not the intent of the Agency to lift managerial
responsibility from TONTC!'s own hands, and that the controls contemplated
by the Agreement aro aimed not at oti fling manonerial activity but rather
to tho attainment of the. minimis chicks which tho Avency fcole it must -
ineist upon in view of the scope and importanco of the TONTC progratin™
the. fulfitinent of the Ageney's own responelbliities and misauions .

6 Tho President e-procced hie appreciation of the Agency's viowpoLnt -

in the mattor of financial control althouch he did not cxpressly comalt
TONIC to its adoption, Hie did, however, promiso to undertake a point by
point review of tho terms of the Acreenent immediately 20 that tho spocifiec
areas of doubt or alsagreencnt may be. localized andi disposed of in: further

% This Statf fcelo that thore is in reality no miswilorctanding of.
the Agreancnt'on the part of TSNIC nor any lack of technical confidence

accept, the minimum of control upon whlch the Agency is insistent.

Freodom Campaign Boginning 15 November may use
a Dropping of Leaflets Theme in its Propaganda.

2s. Le Admiral Miller’ ‘of NCFE has appointed a new head for Crusade
7 _ for. Freedom, Mr. Richard Walsh, formerly of the State Department. Mr.
“Walsh bas subultted ‘a“new plan for. tho Crusade for Freedon campaign to
begin. November 15. The campaign: Will be based upon the idea of send-

ing Christaas ‘message- leaflets behind the iron curtain with publicity
that the Crusade for Froodom will use balloons among other methods for

this:purposé. It was originally coritemplated that the Crusade wuld

“4 fact send balloona-as it did last year, Bearing in wind, however,

the DCI's warning about using any propaganda device which night give

the Soviet a weapon in its bactoriological warfare campaign, we have

instructed ‘the Crusade that. there wu be no actual transaiseion of

balloons. -

. 2. will it bo permisaibie for the Crusade to publicize the use
of balloons, to employ such stunts as dropping the Christnas leaflets
out of balloons over packed football stadiums in the United States
and to give the general impression that balloons will be one of tho
“ways to carry messages from the American people behind the iron curtain,
even ‘though they will in fact not be employed? ;

J. You will apprectate that an immediate decision is essential,

that a major issue needs to bs made of this matter, he is firmly of ©
the opinion that Cafencu is not doing anything useful for the NCFE

‘in Europe and that the net effect of his activities is somewhat to

the disadvantaze of the interests of the United States. Catencu is
believed to be maintaining a rather close associa tion with Cuy de la
Tournelle (sp?) and his wi fe, who are described as "very sour avplee
and bitter opponente of LDC," Cafencu is also reported to have been
involving himself with certain businessmen in Franca in a series of
questionable o11 promotion schemes, He is also reported to have been
engazed in organizing. a kind of information center in eaipre circles
and to be selling this information to Agence Irance Presse. Moreover, .
Gafencu has been selling himself and "throwing his weight around” on
the basis of representations and strong intimations ti:at he is a cloze
and intimate friend of Mr. allen Dulles. lite utterances in this re-
card are regarded by Mr. Hurhes as hishly indiscreet, the more so
since he appears to te living and entertaining on a scale sufficiently
lavish to Suggest that he is being provided with Substantial funds --
well above the allowance granted to him by NCE.

3. Mr. Huphes,as-weli as the Paris Station, fully appreciates
that NCFS is not ina position to force the return of Cafencu to the
United States. At the sane tine, he believes that NCP should do .

all that it can to, got him out of Paris and he recommends that a 1 strong
invitation be extended by- NCFE to Gafancu to return to the United States,
and that this duvitation be coupled with a stitement to the effect that
in view of budyotary conn ‘iderations and the very marginal value of
Gafencu's activities in Europe, it will not be possible ret NCES to
continue his stipend unless lie returns to the inited States and anyAgos

P. S. Since dictating this memorandwa, 1 have received a report from
&@ well-informed Rumanian source to the effect that Cafenew has
Troturned to the United States hin the past few days for the
purpose of remaining here indefinitely. (The fact of Cafencu's
return to the US has been positively established, and it is ~
possible that within the next day or so confirmation will ba’
obtained concerning his lenger-ranse Suture intentions.) ty
Rumanian informant has told me that the real reason for (afencu's
retwm was an urgent request from Malaxa, why feels that he re-
quires Gafencu's present in the United States to assist him :
(Malaxa) in povernment circles, etc. My Rumanian sourca.is
prejudiced against Malaxa, tut has maintained contact with
Cafencu notwithstanding this, anc is convinced that Cafercu
is still on Falaxa's pay roll and subject to Nalaxa's denands
for this reason,

Doar Dareyr:

Thie 49 in reference to your telopnone call of this afternoon,
To havo just had a ull report an the natter of the seven visitors,

Tian afraid you hava gut yourself on the nocx on wile one und
moliing can be Gone about it except to gO through with the bargain
you made. his bargain, the documents indicete, was to bring the
seven Cuecho over here axi take the responsibility you assumed when
you siimed the seven doclarations of supcert alfidavits.

Now having gotten tha’ bud news off ry chest, $ hastwn to add
tat I co not think taie is coing +o be burdensome to you. You are
doing a rend public service, .as I shall axplain in a moment, and all
of us will do owr level dest to heln you. ‘.

T realize thav you did not think you vero agssucd g the responsi-
bility Yor seven peonle. It is cloar, Sovever, that everyone alse
thought you were, and J think it 4s maply t20 lata to chanvo 1t now,
‘The Ceech rezime is attacking the United “tates for its nandling of
enisres; it 1s attacking tra cannes which you have seen; it is pointing
un the general hopelessness of an emivre's Lot ani we dullness and
@rearinass watea you have noted at first hand, this Utcla trip of
our seven frienaa has ret all- the refugee ciroles in Geramy cosnlping.
It 18 exeltdng news, itis tadoubtedly know behind tre curtrin. To
Sall tt off now would rake a real difrerenca <= not tust in torra of
the Crusade, bit in teras af & Polazeed think adoys tha United

States and united States attisans.

The procedure from now on sears to lay itas!£ ont as follows:

The seven refugeos will arrive sonetira curing the smonth of Pecenber. -
Mids arrival date to imortant. Niscg nas. mace every effort to
expedite St so wiat they can come tn Neceher, and

SONS ought to dictate a costzonenent. Trey will se
whatever you, Clyde and Zod want then to do on betaly of the Crusade,
After their work for tne Crusade ia over, all sever couotlesa will
wish to remin in tha Untred States. Wa will all thea fointly try -
t find jobs and placas for then. The visas are yoo! patil next
Anril, but if they can find toda here it wiil prodacly bo nossible
for us to secure special legislation for the: to stay a ladefinitely.

14-0000

a.

Now as to the uwasv.one you raise in your lotter of hovenbar 2bth.
The National Cormitces for a Free Eurove shoud eervaluly look after
thepe pecrlo a they arrive and wills they are ire except insofar
as they are dirécuec by you vo take un certain activi ules ou boralf of .
tip Crigade. The National Comnitteo abould also cooperate ir. trying to
nelp you in your effort to find jobs dor tien wien thelr tour 18° over,
ami I an sure the people there will do thelr best. 1 asa sanding a
eazy of this note to. wadtnsy and. 7 know that he will cooperate to
uns fullest.

As to ¥ wisi question, 7 trink tho expunges of all seven
ought to ba pata for aut oF Cresacie funds, they are over here on
velalf of the Crusade wd you aru the one wno agked thes to coma,

On the third question, as I indicated above, 1 think it would
be a grent blow to Uuliod States policles in this fleld if they were
. 2 turn uround alter their cuties were over anu dimp back te a dusty
refugee carp, . : :

IT tnink tile ig tne way the wholo ti aught to rest now and I
62 moet earnestly urge you not to ba too concerned uvout your personal
rezponsidilities. Ne wili all be lucky if we have o tackle no tougher
problems. . t

THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON

September 7, 1953

Miss McCrum:

Thave a feeling that no one on our s'de is prepared to kcep o firm hand
on the Jean Paul David trip. :

David is himoelf a king-sizo {roe wheeler. Although bo is unquestionably

“one of the French "doers," a9 opposed to “talkers, in thia field, he

is also quite a big-mouth and faclined to over -talk, over-promise and over-

indulge in cloak-and-dagger stage setting. U he hasn't got a guard, armed

to the teeth, with a beret and a balf{-burnod cigarette glued to his underlip,
lurking outside the dining-room, he can't enjoy hig meal. co

The plot io complicated by the fact that as far as the U.S. ie concerned
he has always been strictly covert. This time he arrivea ap strictly

‘“overt'' 60:'no'one on our side will really know how to behave since

everyone will have to-do and be the exact oppoaite of what they did and
were during David's last trip. .

I would suggest that you show ‘the attached to Abbott Washburn, George

~ Morgana, Tom Broaden and/or Bill Durkee, and Joe Phillips (also thio aote)

and suggeot that they wor: out whe should consider himeell responeible,
I personally hope Joe Phillips will be willing to take it on.

Incidentally, the American who handles David best ie Helen Kirkpatrick,
She might conceivably be drafted as chaperone for thie trip.

outlined hie activities and ideas in conncction with the mission with which
he io charged by Georgos Bidault, I received a lettor from him,

roport which he will make on his vurvey should reprosent, without committing
any one country, a systhesia of the views and the resources of the Western
powers allied under NATO, in the broad field of propaganda and peychological
warfare dostgned to build support for Western defenso policy and to promote :
the achlevement of the odjectives of these policies, : .

rs to me that/a difficulty which we-have to face, and which we-

baving to face, is due to the organisational otructure

within which we oparate Officially ia the general field under discussion. “In

a country like Italy, for example, it is possible for David to havo oxchangoa

of views with high officials of-the-government and to feel raasonably sure .
that even though such views are not to be taken as 8 commitment, thoy do in fact
Fepresent the disposition af the government in question, or any government
likely to succeed it, toward these probdlams. In our case, however, it seems

to me that it will requiro careful preparation to determine with whom David
sholild consult and to work out a conatructive position which will: influence

his report and his recommendations in a direction which we approve,

3. It ocd
are probably unique in

4. tis particularly difficult for mo to make specific recommendations,

“aince developments iu Washington in the last few months are difficult to : ;

keep up with from overseaa. It would, therefore, be particularly helpful
to-have headquarters' views at this Stage on the following points, assuming
‘that David. will go to-tXe States in late September on the last leg of his survey:
a. With whom should he meet for basic discussions: (It occurs to i

me that a suitable body, if at il ia existence, woulda the Psychological t
Operations Coordinating Committee.) : :

; b. Within what limits at this time are wo Prepared to discuss the ‘
problem of concerted action for the psychological strength of the North '
Atlaatic Community. ° . . :

5. As headquarters iv aware, Jackson knows David personally,
and it would perhapa be ‘useful to rrange for conversations with him and

“any group he might have in mind.:- It is true that the positioa of David

with rogard to this Agency is anomalous, ‘since the survey on which be is
engaged, far from relating to covert operations, is of the most official

14-0000

kind possible. As headquarters has pointed out, hio intorests-in his present.-
mission in reality pertain more to the State Department-and NATO than
to us, and it scoma to me that we should not be in the direct ‘lino of fire
‘except in. the capacity of individual observers or participants in the:
‘conversations he will have, It would, therefore, seem to be all the more
important that we arrivo at'a clear undoretanding among ourselves aa to
how David's trip to the States will be organised and what is to be the

Translation of Lattor from Jeon-Paul David

bo Juno 19, 1953

You know that - predably tovard the exd of Septonber - I am
to loave. for the United States on a mission entrusted to m9 by
the Miniloter of Foreign Affairs,

Yr, Bidault is soocerned - and juotly 90, about the problems
connected with ths objectives of my survey; end my desire is to-
produce @ renliotice repert ainca I wish to avoid (you know my vay
of thinking) tho traditional phraseology vhich gonsrally takes
the plane of actica. :

To date, in Ytaly, Belgium, Holland, Denmrh, Norvay .. I
bave succesuively conferred with the Prime Ninioters, Ministere of
Foreign Affsire, of Defense, of tha Interior, of Education.” I have.
also sometimes mst vith the Chiefs of Staff, and spectaliste of .

information and of psychological varfare.
To all of them, I have saids

"ir. Bidault hes requested me to mika this survey anil you havo
before you the text of the French note which speaks for itself and -
seems to require no further comment. I want to usk you to atate,
in writing and without in any vay committing your Goverment or your

“particular services, vhat solutions seca reasonable. I wish to gather

all constructive idess oo this mtter. Your ideas vill bo useful,
perhaps, to other couatries ~ oven {f you think them inapplicable in
your ovn. Then, I alaii sake a synthesio of the reports so ascombdled «
adding thereto the thoughts of tho French Ninioter of Foreign Affairs
in this rospect. And, at tha (NATO) ‘Conference of the 1)" at the end
of October, ve shall Neve svaileble a program ou the basia of which
constructive action can be taken,"

There, in telegraphic style, ie my argumnt. I should add that
evoryvhere I found an excellent weloom, overyono accepted this method

and proained mo substantial reports.
But, if in smal) or medium-size countries, I have encountered

no major difficulties, 1 Rave no idea of tho vay of thinking of your

compatriots on such matters. And this note te for no other reason

thon to ask you to express your thoughts, in view of the excellent

advice you can givo m2. o : mL : ;

I vant to. emphasise that, in sy mind, tho reports and - ;

of.any particular country will sot comeit any country in any way.

I W111 maze po one, compronise no cae. I want to gather the eu

that all conmunist functionaries who did not Spend the last war inside

1. Most recent estimates indloates that tie harvest

program of this kind, eepectally should its launching interval
‘be in accage of two weexa, is the systenatio poisoning of food

/ he The initial private avd official offers of food to

Thad a talk with ‘Spencer Phenix about NCFE matters and
the following points were discussed.

(1), A Strategy Board to guide RFE. Spencer feels the need
for some higher level political guidance than RFE is getting from
their staff people and talked about getting together a board of people |
like George Kennan, etc: I told Spencer that I thought it unlikely
that George would give Wery much time to this but might be willing
to give them an occasional idea or suggestion, : .

{2) Spencer asked me ‘about the possibility of their finding -
some job for Sam Reber. I told him to wait on this until I had time

to discuss it with FW, :

(3) Spencer seemed disturbed that the allocation of one

. million a month until our budget was passed would cramp their
- ‘operations, I told him that if they had particular difficulties to

let me know, He also asked what they should do about the proposed
allocation of $400, 000 to: help in the. refugee situation, I told him I
was not familiar with this particular issue, an ;

“ (4) He suggested that it would be well to have ‘a meeting here
with some of the members of the Board and the Executive Comminee
and suggested a date around the first week in August. I told him I

would do it if Lhad not already left the country by that time.

(5) Spencer is pleased with the better integration and

Liberation go that the latter my a‘dress concentrated ani repeated
appeals to the Red Army not to fire on Polish vorkers acd peasants,
wot to interfere in the folish struggle far freejtom, and to consider
the Polish people as the allies of the Sovtet people in their common
struggle against Commaisc. It was this lire that Hacio Liberation
Tollewed during the East Ceraan uprisings. In the evext of viota

in Czechoslovakia vhere the Red Army is cot present in force and
where the satellite security rorces may te unable to keep order,
close cooperation will be even core desiratie.

3. Corsideration could be given to having RYE allot Radio
Liberation reguler time on its prosccants to Poland and bulgaria
where there are large corcentrations of Sovi-t troops 60 that. Radio
Liberation can further duild up the idea or o free, doviet anti-

‘altitudes of 30,000 ft., and penetrated from 60

to 300 miies, depending on the target desired.
The plastic balloons do not burst but descend

to the ground at a polnt. determined by the amount

Meteorcingical data wan obtained from the Neublberg

locuted 7 kilometers from the afte. These
facilities and the pernonnet necessary to man them
were obtained from the U. S.-Almy. They were

able to track target balloons deep inte the

that afternoon the thsodolite was moved to a hiiltop

. publicity about, the operation was discouraged.

The Limi tee Purpose one "Prouparo” has, so far aa we know,
been substantially achieved. Homover, Ba must bo acknowledged
that an operation of this kind! iis both atrongly provocative
and (because ‘of Ata tangible form) susooptidle to dangers. not
risked by radloo There is the further complication that it is
launched from German soil and could conneivably cause in} jury to
RPE's position in Germany. All of these fastors must be
earefully “wolghed in considering any future action of this sorts

Further, this mst be classified an a "orash action", as
evidenced by tho time elapsed datwoen conception and terminations,
Crash actions are good once or twice, but are not to be
recommended as a habit either from the point cf view of cost or,
even more important, 4n cognizance of the utter necessity of
careful and thorough preparation of the beat possible Message.

On the positive side, this ean be stated:

1, The message was timely. worth saying, and clcsaly
integrated with RPE Poideyo

2. Enemy reaction was immediate end sorely hurt.
3. -Intornal conditions and tie world Communist

1.° In Jamary of thia year I diccussed with your office the

due to his oxtonsive ueofulness to FI in Borlin, providing PI
with cover facilities; deads, general services and working very
oatinfactorily in supporting the FI mission in Borlin, at that
time I wee assured by IO that they would do everything possible
to retain Ifr. Koch in Berlin as the RFE representative, In May
of this yoar I had cocasion to visit Bob lang in Naw York on
another matter and T-azain touched uzen Mr, Koch's assignment in
Berlin, at which timo Mr, Lang assured me thet no chunges would

John Elliott has takon cver the KFE office in Borlin and there

Berlin, .

2. We find this solution én extrensly unsatisfactory On.
Fulictt, by background, goneral character, and atility, is not
oo ueeful to FI in Berlin es.Kooh waa end I seriously doubt that
RFE vould find him aa eatisfactory as Koch in standard RFE business.
I knew Elliott vhen ‘he Wag @ nevererer man, end I have checked with
several of his fcrmer colleagues vio agree that he does not have
any of the hard-hitting qualities ac desireble for an PFE repre-
sentative in Berlin. This ts not an attempt to belittle hia.
ability as a journalist but the job in Berlin is very much more
than that, In shert, I would asrrociate your cffice ‘taking steps
with RFE to return Dean Koch to Berlin ag RFE reprecontative, since

COVLET UNION HAS FAILEN SINCE BERIA

1, NO PERSON OF BERLA'S RAUK IN Tui R
HIMSEL? REPIACED YEZIOV IN 1938; THE PURGE COULD NOT HEING ATS-HIGHER LEVEL.
THE CHANGES AGAINST BERLA (GF BEANO A BOUXGEOIS RENEGADE INPERLALLST AGENT WHO

ESTABLISH CAML TALISH IN THE USSR) ARE OP A MAGNITUDE GOMPARABLE ONLY 10 THOSE
AGAINST 1M TROTSKYI TES AND Wie KIGHTISTS IN THE 1920°S.

RAPIDLY THAN AVTER THE DEATH OF LERiN. 17 TOOK FUUR YEARS FOR STALIN TO RE~

SIMPLY MALERKOV HIMSELY. MALENKOV?S NAME APPFARS ONLY ONCE IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT

FROM EB/Czechoslovakia
SUBJECTS Bohumil HOUSER’ . ca!

1. FPeference ta mde to a letter dated 25 June 1953 and addressed
to you from Mr. Leo M. Chorne, Exacutive Director of the Research Inati~
tute of America, forvarding certain proposals sant to the latter by Mre_

“Bohumt]- HOUSER of the International Rescue Committee, Camp Valkay Nusrne
berg, Germany, This. memorandum will suzmirizo.for you our knowledge of
Sudject, ond our present interest in his activities, . : oa

2. Subject was born 1 March 1922 in Bratislava, Cxochoslovakia.

He reportedly fought.in the underground in World War IT and vas taken
prisoner. From the end of tho war until December 1945 ho waa employed
as interpreter to the U.S. miiitary unit in Falknov, Ceachoslovakia, and

in 1949 he vas head of the porsonnel department of the Brom Coal Mining
Company in Falimove ~~ * . .

: . 38° According to a report from the British Army of the Rhine, he was
recruited by the Gzechoslovak Intelligence Service in 1946 in Cheb, Czecho=
Blovakia, and is an ardent Corminist. ‘Aceording to the CIC, ho travelled
to Belgium shortly aftar the var, and then returned to Gerzany (alo). °*

‘4e We do not know exactly when Subject left Czechoslovakia. Ho.
eeors to have enigrated to fustrajia in 1949 or 1950, and to have returned .
to Germany some tims prior to Saptamber 1951, when he became assoclated
with the American Fimd for Czech Refugees ant with the International Rescue
Camittee. According to one informant, Subject was doported from Australia
for Commmiat Party activities. : ue

| :5e On 14 April 1953 Subject sent Mr. Cherne an operational proposal °. ;
of such interest that, in. spite of the unfavorable information on Subject, ° .
we felt obliged to investigate it- further. Upon our instructions; an agent
of the Munich Operations Base contacted Subject on or about 25 June, using
air force cover, and obtained the identity of Subject's lead. This person
turned’ out to te an individuel who has been suspected since 1949 of being _..
an agent of the Czech Intelligence Service, and vhe has very recently ,
been crossing lines with ane or two operations being run by Berlin Opera-
tions Base. Under the circumstances it appears very likely that Subject's:
lead amounts to nothing more than a provocation or fabrication. We are ©
still waiting for an a>praisal a ere ) mondations from the field. +7

lL. On 6 May Congressmen Kersten addressed a letter to the
State Department, enclosing a letter dated 6 May 1953, which he had |
received (rom Mr, Creighton Scott, a former employee of Radio Free -
Europe at Munich, Germany, Thia letter was highly critical of cer-
tain personnel in RFE, particularly as regards allegations of pra-com-
munist attitudes. On 6 July I discussed these criticisms with Congress.
man Kersten in detail, conveying to him orally ‘the material contained —
in the memorandum of 17 June 1953 [rom the Director of Security; Subject: -

Criticisms which Mr, Scott had made but appeared ‘willing to accépt our

he had heard expressed regarding RFE from several Sources, including
Scott. One such criticism is that RFF is ne doing the best :t should on
He feels that this aspect of the bruadcasis’ could

elements, .

4. Mr. Kersien cited the opinion of Count Tarnowski (sp. 7), -a well
known Pole, who told the Congressman that any fourteen year old Soviet
citizen would be s> well briefed on Soviet Philosophy us to tara up their
noses at the RFE material. The Count (and Sersten appears t> agree)
feels that the Soviet population has more sophisticated philosophical
material thrown at them by their own Government, and that it should be an.
important function of RFE to counter with an attempt to destray the Soviet
philosophical material and shake the Soviet faith in their theoreticians, :

5. Congressman Kersten realized that it is difficult to capture a
wide audience with philosophical argunents, but he.fee!s that if these
arguments reached a segment of important leaders behind the Iron Curtain,
it would help to destroy and counter the philosophica! teachings of Marx,
Lenin, etal. The Cungreasmen feels that many of our brdadcasts deal
«with econamic matters, and, while these are important, RFE should go.

particular, he felt (and Scott bore this out in their conversation)
that we were making ton much use of Czech socialiata, and we were
using sociallats from the Bence Gsvernment which had sought to _
compromise with the communists. While he recognizes the popa-
larity of Benes and Masary% in Czechia, he feels they are not ef-
fective in Slovakia, where there is a heavy Catholic pupulation,

1, I think a budget preoentation before a mixed audience of PFC

vwbether it were hold hore or in New York, Yot all tho maxbers of tia
Pl have detailed knowledge of NCKE onerationg and most.of the merbers
of the Zxecutivo Comittee do not have such mmvwledge. I see a reoting
puch as Artaur Page sugneats going about as follows:

a. I0 Divieton presenta tha budget with cuta wich we plan
to recommend.

b. Mephera of the Executive Committee of NCIE oppose the

©. PRC is placed in a position of tarning dom its om

working.
2. 1 ehould sugvest inatoad that we follow the following proce-

a. IO Division presents the budget with the suggested cuts
in sane, °

be PRC considers these cuts carefully.

3. It would be useful to brief the Exocutive Comittee on
the reasons why any changes in the budget aro made aftor they are —

A day er two before I sailed for burope in Jamary, 1953, I received) |
a-typed manuscript copy of tho "Progress Report on the College de 1'Zurope
_ Uibre", which has now appeared in mimcographed form under date of February
27,1953, over the signaturus of Royall Tyler and Richard Sears

I admit to considerable curiosity when this document appeared, In
the covering letter Royall Tyler morely stated, "It comes from Dick Sears".
I rather wondered why this report should be compiled when it was| known I was
coming to Europe presumably to examine into comiittons and it seemed tome
immediately that this might.be a counter foil to what it was expected I
would find, In reply to a direct inquiry from r@, Sears now states it was

‘prepared "to reinforce the German languago urt project by supplying informa.
: tion that was apparently lacking.

At the risk of indicating an overly suspicious temperament, which is
not charactoristic of mo, I fecl that this. report over-simplifies|a complex
i _ . Situation. It emedies a point of view that the operation at Strasbourg
‘ -fs proceeding smeothly and successfully, hich it is not. It assums that a
paper plan (for the National Seminars) is in full and healthy bloom, which is
“not the case. I have stated so frequently (almost ad nauseam) that you must
live in this frustrating atmosphere for a while before you can understand what
conditions are. Royall Tyler and Sears have never had that experience ani
formed their opirions from what ‘they have been teld by Davis, Galy, Straka,
and Donzelot. The latter in turn was constantly fed information by Galy and
Straka, and altogether has spent only thrde or four days on the ground. He
has had numerous: talks in. Yaris with Galy and some.of: the tutors

So, while the factual material in this report can not be questi onéd
— I mean the statistics and the historical portions — th interpretation of
_them dceos not reflect the disappointing results. This pertains to the work |
of the Comittee on Awards on the one hand and ths actual operationjat Robertsa
on the other, : . : ”

When I asked Sears-hew widely this report hed been distributed he told !
me "to the Trustees of FEUZ, to tha members of the Association du College

The sentence (bottom of Page 9 and going over to top ofPaga 10),
"These vere mon of advanced education, oxpert in their kiowledgo of jthodr own
countries but also, most of then, having studied in Frenc?: institutions ard 80
capable of forming a bond for thy students betwoen their training at, homo and_
in exile.", is not an securate description of tho caliter of tho tutorde

‘On Page Ui, aecond lino, I would question defivitely the phrase
fyoll organized administration”. Also on that page, sixth lino, tha| sentence,
"Special Freneh courses were being given to those who still showed woaknesas"y
is ‘misleading. Such courses wore announced, but the progren for teaching the
French language ie only now being ou
staff at Strasbourg University after a conferonce with then I called

purpose.

for thia

On the same page again, fifth line fron the botton, the phrase "the
sevority of the action taken in tho autumn has had a salutary effoct|in |
imposing firmer discipline and ‘setting higher standards” eirply 19 not Soe
The manner in whictthe action waz taken, and tho inaccirazy af sove of the
judgments, whichhad to te reversed, called forth proteats from staff jand stu-

dents alike and did as mich aa anything else to cause present low student morale.

On Page 16, the last sentence in tho first paragraph roads, "A fresh
start in lifa combined with exposure to Western thought ard practice will, we
are encouraged to hope, produce a full return." Instead of what th statement
implies, the students have witnessed a.cleavage between the suropean staff and

“tho Americans, -- and the "exposure to Wostern thougltard practice" has been

anything but inspiring. or unifying.

The distribution of this document can bo and will be very misleading
by ita imlications that success has been achieved to an extent that warrants
our proceeding on our present path. That will be unfortunate. ‘ie Inve acquired
a fund.of valuable experience and we havo made mistakes. Tle net result igs tho
present situation, Fundamental ohangos mst be made, which arc bound|to be
unpleasant, but they are essential, unless we are going tc continue a| mere.

(a) unacceptable now, (b) say be used one tine only, or (c) may be used and

- 2. Of particular interest tous, and pousthing wo consider vorthy of
RFE'a attention, 1s the recent ‘uso of Rrneat Koliqt for the preparation ofa
soript. Mr. Koliqi is-a.nanber of the FKI, a political organization which has
beon unaccoptable in the past. Mr. Koligi 1o further unacceptuble as lan indi-
information available on him
it appeara that he “cooperated vith the Italian Minister to Tirana in|preparing
the Italian ecoupation . . . returned to Tirana {he had long lived in|Italy as
he docs nov) whero he hold the post of Minister of Education 1939-194).
Member of the Albanian Paseist party."

3. It would seam that the use of Mr. Koliqt for the preparation jof
scripts 1s subject to serious question. In this acript for February ‘a2, page
2, he statea "a much better presentation of the various literary phases . . «
is. the anthology entitled. Zhe Albanian Writers published in 1941 by'the
Mintotor of Education.® (Kote that ha wags tho Minister of Education during

thie period under the Fascist governnent.) ™

4. There are other specific exzplesa of possibly doubtful porsons having.
beon used in the preparation of scripts, Diniter Hareti, a Zogist official
thon Zog was in power, a Fascist official vhen the Pasclate vere in pover, and
bow reported ‘to be a Cozuunist stooge, was used on several: oocasions. | Zef
Shiro, forwerly, and possibly still, editor of the Fascist magazine, “Albania®

a. Tho orincipal objectives of the AH¥ procram are to provide

cover for HCPE-77% and CYA through a imitiplicity of ostenslble
sources of funds, fund raising ia a Glotine tly secondary objective. —

bd. For seversi reasons, cover funderaising for tho Committee
fer Free Azia sould be carried on outetde tho Crusade for
_ Freedor activity. a may at some future dato wis! to transfor the
funderaising for the Comittee for a free Asin to some other organi-
gation. In any event, we do not want the Crusade name linked with
the Cosmities for a tree Asia. .

_¢. The previous Crusade onerations have beon inefficiently
operated, It has cost a collar to raise a dollar. We know that
Aly wil be run on a- “‘busineselixe basia, as have Aly past: ovorations.

Dear bh

Cea pee emeern creer, einatanl beeper dtr inal

. - You my be interested in 4 dispateh which I received nore 8
couple of says ago and watch 1 quote as follows1 :

Pon January 1k, Alexander Booker of the Garman Foreign office
infeomally brought to our attention a map of Eastern Europe .
whieh apveared in the Lecember tasue of "News from Behind the ©
Iroc Curtain", a ponthly periodieal published by the "National
Comittee for a Freo Europe”, Tois map which ia oho in. .
gmsit seale on paze 1 of this periodical, shows oll of Eastern
Germany, including East Prussia, %26 Satellite States, and the
forner Saltic Statee, In the case af the former Gorman terri-
tories east of tne Oder-Heigse lins, tie area 19 simply shown
as belonging to Poland, and its sre-war borders are not sot
off dy a dotted line, ‘With reasecs to Poland, Caechoslovakia
and fomania, however, the territsrios that were annexed by

the Soviet Union during or after iorld War IT aro clearly

. Barked by a dotted lins. Furthermore, the Eastern Zone of
Germcy ag well as Zast Prussia are snown in the same colors
as ths Soviet Union, whereas the Raitic and Satellite States

are sown in white.

PAltsoozh Booker adeitted that the nap itself was not of great
impertance, he severtheless pointed out that it represents —
‘a tyrical example of the one-elded antixierman propaganda’
put >t not only by the National Comdttoe for a Free Europe
but also by Hacio yree Europe. Sue propaganda, he said, can
. Only increase the niseyivings whieh many Germans, particularly
: : ' the ralugees, alreacy entertain with respect to the activities
poe | of ita committee and on:the cperations.of Radto Free Europe on
: . Germaa soil. Finally, Booker politely hinted that the German .
14 Gorercment would welcome it if the U. S. High Commission’ would .
use its influence with the National Committee for a Free Europe
' to stop dissemination of such anti-serman propaganda in the -
fotczte. A more constructive and objective propaganda policy
a of t22 comalttee and Fadio Free Eurme alang the lines of a
Loe large> Suropean Commnity that would embrace Poland and Crecho- -
i : Blovacia as well aa a.-reunited Germany and the other European
ot natiocs would not only contribute to a bettar understand ing

14-00000

between the various refugee eLamants but would also havo |
the full eupport of all Gernios, Sookor added." J!

Incidentally, I think you are doing an awfally good job on this
kind of thing, The other night 1 actually read through an entire,
cory. a

Tho articlo on musio for the nasses and the general axnoge of
the attack on the arts is particuiariy elunificant, [ think. Until
the recent anti-Semitism, this f1e27 of culture te the one Meld of
Soviet activity in wiich they wore welnerablo before neutralista and-
fallov-travalers everywhere, ‘Tha texiancy of the intellectual to-
Swallow. the Soviet line on oulture, > fall for the Stalin Prises,
‘the high status accanied tha obedient intelleatual in Soviet Boclety,

‘Zand peeudo-sctentifie appeal of the Serxian dowma of equality ta

eangerous. In a tree society, the istallectual is the origin of
ideas, : . \

Anything we can do to show the sac% that avory aaract of Sovtet
culture has been transformed into an instrumont.of the State, that -
the inteliectual's role is important aly vo long as he is odedient,
that dn fact the product of the Sovies artist would not hold 4& candle
%> the standards set. dy fellow-travelia;s circles in Vestem Burope,
and that tho. Soviet has corrupted the crinctples of equality on which
it presumes to atand is terribly important. .

T am sure you are aware of all the adove but I thought of it:
when I read tho piece in the last issce, and BY comment is just
anothor way of telling you what a good job I think you are doing.

PSUBUFCPs Craft RCFP Policy Statement

1, Attuchad ig a croft NCFF Poltey Statement which hay been
reviewid and secented oy tha Fxacutive Committee of NCFY, but which
was sent to us without the mnowledvoa of /cmiral Filler aad therefore
should probably not be com-entet on by you to any of our frienis in
New York unleng ym have olso received a copy from another gource,
‘drtral Hiller probably intends to sen! us this ectatement after 4t
has been artroved by the Uoard of Lirectors,

2. You may wish to comere 4t with the old ice-box statement
now in effect, also attached,

3, You may also wish to note Part T, varagraph 2 in thich
mention is made of government surnort, It is apparently the intent
Of NCFF to make this staterent, no* an iee-box utatement, bul a publie
document and 1f so, T think you ought to mate particularly certain

that you-arprove this nort of tt.

4. Pinally, I thin yu will want to note the general tenor of
Part III, Perhaps { aa quibbliny, but it seems to ma a trifle full-
blown. I realize that NCFF is a seperate government agency just
under cabinet status, but this ravis a little bit as though it wore

putting on the trappings of national soverelynty,

1951 in this connection denonstrate ths possible magnitude of that problem,

Aft it bo true that the building, ‘if.omed by the Fund, would be exempt

SUBJECT 2 Arthur Maier; younr Ceech political refugee
recomended by Mr. Ortona of the Italian Embassy.

1. Attached hereto ig a letter from Egidio Ortona of tho Italian
Embassy, who is recassending for our consideration the aboveenaned ~
individual who 1s said to be the son of Dr. Arthur Malxner, forserly
‘the Minister Plenipotentiary of Czechoslovakia to the Vaticen. Also
attached ia a brief curriculua Vitae of Maixner.

2. It is rather “unusual for a foreign diplomat, even though he-
be on good terma with officials of this Agency, to recomend personnel
to us for our use, and uncer thé circuustances I do not suppose that
there would be acy,way in which you could make secure use of this
young man even if you were to find him in other respects suitable, In
other words, he is Shlown® by thé. very fact of his heving been recon=
mended .to us by a foreign diplomat, And I am also aware of the fact
that thia would be a zood cheap way of effecting penetrations of the
Agency were we to foliow the practice of acting favorably on recan-
mendations of this character, Hevertheless, thera may te sone aspect
of this matter which would have sivmificance to you or to Mr. Tian
which -I do not readily serceive, and accordingly I an passing this

- on to you and to Hr. Tima with this thought in oind, For exaaple,

there ie a bare possibility that Licause of the contacts and connet~
tions of Maimer end his f:ther, a former Czech diplomat, it might be
possible to make uge of him (on an arma'!s-length basis) in a prograa
of defector solicitatio, ~ :

3. I am also furnishing a copy of this memorandum to Hr. Braden

in view of the possibility that aixner might be of same use to Radio

Free Europe, assuming that the ocjection of his having beer introduced
to this Agency by Ortona coula be overcome.

“bh. In any case, I should anprectate. your sugzesting a suitable

_Teply to Mr. Ortona, beering in mind tle fact that he has-been helpful

to us in the past and does seem to be well disposed.

with Radio Frue Europe. Free magazine advertising was widely used for the

MEMORANDUM FOR+ Deputy Diroctor Central Intelligence

You may wish to spoak to the Director about the fact that
Charles Moore, a very close friend of mine who isa Diroctor of
Public Helations for the Ford Motor Company, called me last week
to cuggest that hia boss, Honry Ford, would like to be asked to
become President of the Weritage Foundations .

I think thio lays to rest any fears wo may have had of Mr.

Ford's “(in roality Mr. Moore's) criticiam of the Crusado for
.. Freedom leading to Mr. Ford's becoming Anactive on our behalf.

The Director might wish to call Mr. Ford and ask him to

. Background

1. The State Department haz asked that R°R not apsreach Turkish .
authorities until VOA's attempt to get into Turkey has been accepted . ,
or refused by the Turks. Tre. Senartment has now given the Voice of ,

America until-15 January to contlude its negotiations with the Turkish
Government. These negotlations appear toa be leading nowhere and, on
the assumption that VOA will. not gain entrance to Turzey, the Departe
ment has authorized HFE to bevin negotiations on the 2rove date.

_ 2. Bob Lang, 8411 furk2e end Me. Wadsworth, former An
to Turkey, as well ag the IE Lévision have all beer in on di
as to hew NCFS should esoroach the Turks. Mr. Wadeworth counsels ~
table, and ha bares his ressorirg on
his velie? that the Turke will xigw sbout it anyhow and that RFE 1s.
likely to get further if it comes clean. The NE Divieion on the
other hand hopes that the aprroach can de that of a nrivate committee
and that no mention need be made of ClA's interest,

3. Your advice on the atcve questicn will not constitute approval
of the ovilding of a Turzish station or at operations om Turkey. By

PR? decision at the Last nearing on NCTC's budect these suestions in
Turkey must be brought bacx here for apcroval if the aunitude of the

Turks is favorable.
