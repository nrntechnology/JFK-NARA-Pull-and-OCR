FROM ; : S. D. Breckinridge
Principal Coordinator, HSCA
Office of Legiglative Counsel

SUBJECT : House Select Committee on Assassinations
Request for Access to the "Hart Report"

1. Action Requested: That you approve the recommendation at ©
paragraph 14 for limited access of selected House Select Committee
on Assassinations (HSCA) staff members toa classified, sanitized |
version of the Hart Report.

2. Background: As you know, the HSCA Staff Director, Mr. Blakey,
has requested you in a letter dated 9 May 1978 (Tab A), to provide access
to a report prepared by John Hart in 1977 on the subject of the Agency's
handling of the Nosenko case. This request is part of an inquiry into
hypotheses arising from Epstein's book Legend, in which the view is
presented that Nosenko was a dispatched agent with the mission of
concealing KGB ties with Lee Harvey Oswald. Central to HSCA interest.
is the question of Nosenko's bona fides. Additional to that issue, interest
has developed in the manner in which Nosenko was treated during the period

that his bona fides were Suspect. These two issues are treated separately
below. : . :

I

3. The Hart report is directed at the handling of the Nosenko case,
addressing the actions and conduct of various officers in the Agency. These
matters cannot be treated without also considering the question of Nosenko's
bona fides, so there also is considerable review of the methodology employed

-and the analyses of those handling the matter. Mr. Blakey states in his
letter that he has been.informed that the report contains no information on
the issues of bona fides, being concerned instead only with personnel and
internal procedures. This understanding on his part is incorrect, and
his letter suggests that he himself has reservations about it.

13-00000

- 4. The Agency has made available to the HSCA two studies conducted

in 1967 and 1963 by SE Division, both of which questioned Nosenko's
bona fides. A subsequent study by the Office of Security in 1968 has also
been made available; it reached a conclusion contrary to the preceding
studies and supports Nosenko's bona fides. Other Soviet defectors have been
interviewed by the HSCA staff, as well as knowledgeable CIA officers and
retirees. As a result, much of the information on the case has been
revealed to the Committee.

5. The two SE Division studies, concluding that Nosenko was a KGB
agent, were superceded by the Office of Security study, which prevailed.
The HSCA investigators reportedly have problems with how the earlier two
studies could be rejected so shortly after their completion. As a result,
the HSCA seems focused on the issues as viewed at that time. The Hart
report has the advantage of having been prepared after a ten year period,
during which experience with the validity of Nosenko's information provides
the basis for an objective re-examination. It is relevant to HSCA interests
that the Hart Report constitutes a convincing statement of the bona fides
of Nosenko. Access to this portion of the Hart Report would help broaden
and complete the understanding of the HSCA of the matter. .

6. Because of the above, the ‘Agency has everything to gain and nothing
to lose in providing the Hart Report for its review of the issue of Nosenko's
bona fides -~

Ir

7. In addition to the central issue of Nosenko's bona fides, Chairman
Stokes has expressed interest in the treatment accorded Nosenko during the
period that his bona fides were in question. Nosenko reportedly has provided
the HSCA with some detail on this. We have made the point that how
Nosenko was treated was a result of the issue, not a part of it. When we
questioned the relevance of this line of inquiry to the HSCA charter,

HSCA staff representatives assert that their charter extends to the conduct
of the intelligence agencies in the Warren Commission inquiry which
includes this. The rationale appears a bit contrived and stretched in terms
of the real issues. How Nosenko was treated may indicate how concerned
‘CIA was with the man's bona fides, but so far as relating further to the
iaquiry concerning President Kennedy's assassination, it seems marginal at
best. The rationale is so far-fetched that we have been led to Consider that its
dramatic qualities are attractive for the projected TV spectacular this
coming September. It also doubtless provides an opportunity for public
criticism for those staff members who have been acknowledged by Mr.
Blakey as hostile to the Agency.

Um alelers
aoe
8. If the rationale of the HSCA for pursuing the question of
Nosenko's treatment is contrived, and largely peripheral to the real
purpose of the Committee, as we believe it to be, it should be faced
in those terms. No one would disagree with there being relevant
inquiries, but it is hardly proper to take an internal critique and turn.
it against the Agency on a point irrelevant to the central purpose of the
inquiry. The HSCA staff position is tendentious, and reflects on its
face a hostile attitude that the Committee may not otherwise want to be
so obvious. The Committee has the right to determine what is relevant
to its charter, but the Agency should also assert.a.similar right to defend
itself from truly peripheral and hostile fishing expeditions.

9. Therefore, while we believe that the Hart Report should be made
available to the HSCA staff, we do not believe that such action should be
taken prior to attempting to limit the use made of information contained
in the Report not related to the issue of Nosenko's bona fides.

noe
10. There are aspects of the Hart Report that contain information on

foreign liaison services that should not be exposed to the HSCA. There is,
therefore, a question of some sanitization to be conducted prior to the

’ Report's being made available.

ll. A version of the Report has been prepared for the FBI in which the
names of employees below the DCI have been removed, as well as certain
modifications in more dramatic rhetorical phrases. That version is in
other respects faithful to the original Report. It provides a-working basis
for further sanitization. Sanitization prior to review is not foreign to the
HSCA, as the Directorate of Operations has had a continuing policy of
selected sanitization. Extending this practice to the Hart Report would
be consistent with the extant working relationship with HSCA. The Report
will remain classified. :

12. If the paper is made available, classified and sanitized, it should be
on a highly restricted basis; the HSCA wants six named persons to have
access to it, which is at least three times the number needed for bona fide
research purposes.

13. Staff Position: This paper favors making a sanitized version of the
paper, in classified form, available to a limited number of the HSCA staff
representatives at the CIA Headquarters Building at Langley. Any such
release should be preceded by appropriate discussions limiting use of the
material by the Committee. The General Counsel is of the opinion (Tab B)

viat if the paper is withheld, anda court test results, the Agency

siust expect to fail in withholding the paper. The Office of the General
‘counsel, the Office of Security, SE Division and CI Staff favor making the
paper available under the conditions set forth above.

14. Recommendation: That you approve granting access to a limited
number of staff members of the HSCA to a classified, sanitized version of
the Hart Report. Such access shall bé conditioned on agreement to limit
use of materials contained in the Report to those matters relating to the
«juestion of Nosenko's bona fides.

SUBJECT: WASHINGTON POST Request to Talk to an Agency aL
Specialist on the Kennedy Assassination MEO if-

The WASHINGTON POST is preparing a series of articles on a
the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Kennedy
assassination.

With the help of CIC, we recently arranged for George :
Lardner and Walter Pincus of the WASHINGTON POST to interview A
former KGB officer Yuri Nosenko about his knowledge of Lee i
Harvey Oswald during the time Oswald lived in the Soviet
Union. To ensure that Nosenko's resettlement identity and
location would remain protected, I made the arrangements for
Nosenko to come to Washington for the interview.

The POST reimbursed Nosenko for expenses and paid him a
$250 consulting fee. The interview was done on Wednesday,
3 March, at the POST offices downtown. I did not remain for
it. Lardner and Pincus also hosted a lunch for Nosenko which
was attended by Ben Bradlee. Lardner and Pincus were very
pleased with their session with Nosenko and appreciative of
our making it possible. I also spoke afterwards with Nosenko
who said he was satisfied with how the interview was
conducted and with the financial arrangements.

Shortly after the interview, Lardner faxéd me a list of
the questions that he and Pincus had prepared for themselves
to use in checking out Nosenko's information. They asked if
there was anyone at the Agency they could talk to about the
individuals named. I told them that developing information
in response to- their questions would probably take a good
deal of research arid. that I doubted the Agency would be able
to take on such a task at this time for the POST. However, I
said I would take it up with the appropriate offices.

Although I told the POST that I do not believe anyone
would be willing to undertake research on their questions,
Itm wondering if there is anyone around who might be
knowledgeable of Nosenko's information who would be willing
to talk with Lardner and Pincus on background based on
his/her existing knowledge. I think Lardner and Pincus would
be grateful for making such a person available even if
SUBJECT: WASHINGTON POST Request

all their questions aren't answered. Considering that they
are trying to do serious research on the Kennedy
assassination, I think any effort on our part to help them
would be seen as a gesture of good will.

Memo’ to: C/HRG

Subject: Mangold Litigation a

Today I alerted OGC (Theresa Wilcox/é ery 2K Ba) that
the JFK collections contains a significant number of .
documents on Nosenko (5-6000 pages) which may impact on the~
Mangold litigation. As I understand it, the Mangold
Litigation is over the Angelton files and is several years
old. According to JFK reviewers at the FBI, documents on
Nosenko's defection and treatment are part of case. I
talked with Theresa Wilcox who is the para-legal hangling
the litigation, however, she was not familiar: with the” .
documents involved. She will consult with eae, the lawyér
on the case, and get back to me. —-

I consider the ball in OGC's court. I propose that we
continue to review the Nosenko files. If there are Mangold
or other consideration to address, we can do so after the
HRG review is complete.

Memorandum For: C/HRG
Subject: Nosenko and the Mangold Litigation

I received a call from (Kathy Kelly, OGC, this morning
concerning the Nosenko files in the JFK files. I described
the files again (about 4000+ pages that include transcripts
of all his interrogations and numerous studies on his bona
fides and treatment by the Agency including the Solie and
Hart reports and an 835 page comprehensive study). Since
Nosenko is an important figure in the JFK assassination
story and the files are part of the sequestered collection,
HRG is reviewing the files under the JFK Assassination
Records Collections Act. However, we were aware that some
of the documents were part of the Mangold litigation and
wanted to make sure that they were properly coordinated.

®athy Kelly)said that the Mangold litigation should not be a

factor in HRG's review. If the files were subject to the
JFK Records Act, they should be processed under that Act.
When the review is complete, a list of the documents
released should be provide so that OGC can treat them the
same in the Mangold case.

I also talked with Kathy Stricker (yesterday) to get some
background on the handling of Nosenko files and what were
the "secrets" given what we know is publicly available. She
said for years the agency "glomared" Nosenko except for the
Oswald information: however, once Golitsyn became public
that ended. Today, the battle over his bona fides and how
he was treated are public knowledge. The Agency up until a
couple years ago had not released some of the studies (she
mention Solie) but she was not sure that this was still the
case or if it was possible to continue to deny them. DO has
protected the information provided by Nosenko on other
Soviet sources and leads. for possible recruitment. This
type of information should continue to be protected.

Kathy Stricker's comments are consistent with HRG's handling
of the Nosenko files. We are considering all of the files
as related; his bona fides is a key element of the story and
there was a large amount of information including parts of
the studies on him in both the Oswald 201 and the JFK hard
copy collection. We have deleted information provided on
other sources and operations not related to the JFK story.
We are also recommending release of the rest of the studies.
Although they contain potentially embarrassing information
for the Agency (as did the IG report on the Castro plots),
there doesn't appear to be grounds for denying under the JFK
Act. .

Restrictions on Declassifying Material on Yuriy Ivanovich
NOSENKO

The following should be used as guidelines in
declassifying material files pertaining to the career and
"bona fides" of Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

1. CIA Knowledge of Russian intelligence tradecraft.
Specific information in the files about KGB targetting of
American citizens could reveal to the Russian Intelligence
service our knowledge of their tradecraft. Since the
Russian services continue to target Americans, this
information should continue to be protected.

2. To protect a CIA asset. Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO
remains an asset of this agency, and is under contract.
Moreover, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVRR)
remains interested in NOSENKO's whereabouts and activities.
Russian intelligence services since the Second World War
have tried to track their defectors. There are indications
that the Russian services remain interested in the NOSENKO
case.

o At the time of his arrest,{Rick Ames had some }

¢NOSENKO files (AESAWDUST) \in his possession. The US

Counterintelligencé community is unsure if this

material was passed (to the Russian service.

--Following NOSENKO's brother and mother's visit to the

United States, both were questionned by the Russian
service about NOSENKO's activity and place and
residence.

torsion, Heian, Gerndon, Virginim 22071

Dear Bob, |

It was very good to meet with you again in Washington on June 12.

T am writing to confirm our recent convereation about the CIA's release
of dociments about me ta the National Archives. 4s I explained to you at
cur meeting, I am very. displeased that this was done without ny knowled-
ge end especially eince ny photograph was officially released by the
Agency for the first time in thirty years. :
2?

As you know, it hes come to my attention that the CIA released these
meny hundreds of pages to the public without consulting te or telling

ne that this wes going to be done. I have already seen copies of two of
these reports totalling more than 700 pages. One is the Coteber 1968
‘report supporting me by Bruce Solie; the other was a February 1968 re-
port by the CI Steff which attacked my credibility. (This latter report
contains a copy of my photo from the late 1960s. I consider this a breach
of my personal security.) .

I also consider many of the details in both of these reports to he of a
very personal nature. Other pages deal with with some very sensitive
cases which I gave the Agency about other people. The information in
these rerorts was given freely and accurately by me to the CIA officers
in the 1960s under terma of strict confidentiality. Although it is very
difficult for me to say this, I feel that my trust in the Agency hae now
been seriously daneged.

This release particularly troubles me @ because for the past thirty years.
I have remained very loyal to the Agency and considerate ef its wishes. |
For instance, despite many requests, I have only, spoken to a few jour&
nalists, and only when the Agency advised me eo, T have never sought
P.474

eR my own ta publish my story in an article or took, But now, the CIA
has not returned this courtesy. Insteed, 4¢ has released sensitive
information to the public without speaking to me first.

Under the circumstances, I would like to respectfully request the
following: .

1. That you show this letter to DDO Ted Price, Director James Woolaey,

and the current heads of the CIA's Freedom of Information Office and
Ristorical Review steff ~- go that they are aware cf what has happened.

2. I would like te receive, in writing, an explanstion frem these res-~
ponsible.ef whr this release was done, :

3B. I weuld like te receive a list ef the major reperta absut me which
have already been released. Aside from the twe reports that I already
have seen, I would like te receive copies ef any ether major studies

that have been released. (For instance, if there are reperts released
by Peter Bagley, Newton Miler, James Angleton, the OF Steff end John

Hart, then I wevld like to see them as well.)

4. I would like te be given the Agency's written assurance that further
releases will not ecour witheut censulting me first.

Bab, you sheuld know that before I wrete this letter I have speken
abeut this matter with my geed friend George Kalaris, He tse was troub-
led by what I teld him, and he advised me that I sheuld ask the Sgency
for an explanation.

Beb, I apolegize fer troubling you with this matter, but I have no one
else te turn te fer assistance. ;

Please let me knew if there is any resperse as seen as possible.

Draft letter to Nosenko from Fhe PRO,

Dear .

The Director has asked me to respond to your letter
expressing concern that US Government declassification of
material could compromise your privacy and security.

In regard to your question about the documents that have
already been released, rest assured that I have directed
officers responsible for FOIA requests to take special care
in reviewing information concerning you in light of your
_- Special circumstances. We will make full use of all
een possiblé xcoptions to FOIA-mandated declassification in
‘ order to protect your privacy.

N

As you know, in 1992 Congress passed the JFK Assassination. SY et a
Records Collection Act, which required all US Government .
agencies to release any records related to theVassassinatio
of President Kennedy. As Deputy Director for Operations, I
am of course committed to fully supporting the DCI in
meeting this requirement, but I also appreciate your concern
about the files on you that are related to the °
assassination. I have therefore directed a senior officer

win the DO to meet with the officials in the Agency's
Hr sted steed who are involved in the declassification
gevil’ program. This officer has had extensive discussions with
bret /_ 3 of the @ba®H.and has worked closely with them to
dentify those portions of the files that include personal
fa} and operational information. dente Ba!
. akies Spee. ato i a) peelers

As a result of this effort, we have (postponed-release-of ~any]
Seut +tv¢ information touching on your private life or on operational
information pertaining to your debriefings. Under the JFK
law, a Presidential Review Board will make the‘ final
- decision on the disposition of the material. This Agency
values the sacrifices you have made for our country, and we
will present the Board with the strongest possible case for
protecting information that could affect your privacy and
security.

According to\Wukitch} Combs also wants to take to the ARRB two /etters pertaining to the affair:
the letter Nosenko wrote in 1994 objecting to the release of his material without his being consulted
or advised, and the fetter Ted Price wrote to him in response assuring him that everything possible
would be done to prevent further release of his papers. | don't see any problem with this since the
papers would support our position--unless the ARRB starts thinking about releasing the letters also.

( Wukitchsaid she told Combs CIC would have(Bob Pringlé, former Chief of AG/FIOB currently
serving as Officer in Residence at the University of Kentucky, flown in to address the ARRB if this
appears necessary. Combs will pass this on to the ARRB. (Wukitch\noted that Combs alluded to
the possibility that that ARRB might want to talk with Nosenko himself.

MEMORANDUM

August 5, 1997 : CIA HAS NO OBJECTION TO

, DECLASSIFICATION AND/OR
To: T. Jeremy Gunn RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENT
From: Michelle Combs
Subject: Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko

Ihave prepared this memorandum at your request for the upcoming meeting where the
Board will be briefed on issues telated to the Soviet defector, Yuriy Nosenko.

Summary and Recommendation

The information on Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko contained in the CIA Sequestered
Collection microfilm consists of approximately 3500 pages of interviews, transcripts,
memos, and reports. Of the total, approximately 1200 have been released to the public
as open in full or with only minor redactions. Of the 1200 released pages, roughly 800
contain information directly relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy
assassination.

After my review of the Nosenko records and our discussion of the issues, it is our
judgment that the remaining 2300 pages are unrelated to the assassination of President
Kennedy and we recommend that they be processed as “NBR.” These NBR records
consist of such items as general family and professional contact information, Soviet

.intelligence methodology and operations, and Soviet navy information dating to
Nosenko’s early career in Soviet Naval Intelligence. I suggest that we review carefully
these 2300 records to ensure that there is no assassination-related material, and, to the
extent this is correct, we should process them as “NBRs.”

Background on Nosenko

KGB Lieutenant Colonel Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko first secretly contacted the CIA in |
Geneva in June 1962. One and a half years later on February 4, 1964, he defected to the
United States for what he said were ideological reasons. His-case became the single
most difficult counterintelligence case in the Agency's history to date. Nosenko’s
information on the assassination of President Kennedy made his bona fides of more
importance than simply a means to determine his true identity or whether he was the
prototype of a KGB disinformation plot against Western intelligence agencies.

The conflict over Nosenko began two and a half years prior to his actual defection, in
13-00000

2

December 1961, when Anatoliy Golitsyn, a KGB defector, predicted that the KGB would
dispatch false defectors after him to discredit him and confuse Western intelligence
agencies as part of a massive disinformation campaign. Golitsyn, who had described a
darkly intentioned monolithic Russian master deception plan and Soviet intelligence
agencies of brutal efficiency, claimed that Nosenko was the most important of these
fake defectors and that any Soviet sources who came later and supported Nosenko’s
bona fides would also be false. Golitsyn was wholly believed by Counterintelligence
Chief James Angleton, who shared Golitsyn’s world view. Golitsyn argued that any
CIA officers who believed Nosenko should be considered as moles themselves.

Nosenko’s first four meetings with the CIA in Geneva in June 1962 produced an

- intelligence bonanza and the two CIA officers (George Kisevalter and Peter Bagley)

who.met with him believed he had conclusively proved his bona fides. During his
debriefings in 1964, Nosenko provided detailed information about Lee Harvey
Oswald’s stay in the USSR which, he said, had come across his desk routinely as the
deputy chief of the Second Chief Directorate (SCD) department responsible for
watching American visitors in the USSR.

With Golitsyn arguing against Nosenko’s bona fides, plans were made in March 1964,
to imprison Nosenko and begin hostile interrogations to find any shifts in his
information. On April 2, Deputy Director for Plans Richard Helms and Soviet Division
Chief David Murphy met with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General and obtained legal
approval from the Justice Department-to imprison Nosenko so that he could not
communicate with his supposed KGB controllers. On April 4, he was imprisoned in an
attic room in a CIA safe house near Washington. Nosenko was kept in solitary
confinement, subjected to. physical and mental torture, and submitted to hostile
interrogations from April 4, 1964 to October 27, 1967 first at the safe house and then ina
specially built cement house in Virginia. Despite over three-years of severe treatment,
Nosenko’s original story remained unchanged, no “confession” was forthcoming, and
no evidence was produced indicating he was, as Golitsyn still claimed, a fake defector.

On August 8, 1968, Nosenko was polygraphed for the third time by an Office of
Security specialist. During the examination, Nosenko was asked whether he had told
the truth about Oswald and the Kennedy assassination; the polygraph operator found
only positive responses to the questions. Security Officer Bruce Solie submitted a
comprehensive report in October 1968 which evaluated all of Nosenko’s information, to
date, and concluded that he was what and who he‘had claimed to be all along. After a
review of his case by the Soviet Division, Nosenko was finally released from CIA
custody on March 1, 1969 and employed as an independent consultant by the CIA.

In the 35 years since Nosenko first approached the CIA in Geneva, no prima facie
evidence has ever emerged to prove that he was a KGB provocation and subsequent
defectors have affirmed him as a bona fide defector. He has identified many hundreds.‘
of Soviet intelligence officers, provided a considerable quantity of useful information on
the organization, doctrine and methods of the KGB, and conducted numerous special
"studies on Soviet subjects. Today, Nosenko is seventy years old, recently retired as a
contractor from the CIA, an American citizen, married, and living quietly in the
Sunbelt.

Subject: Nosenko records in JFK Collection

The ARRB (JFK Board) staff has agreed to accept CIA's
designation of 25 folders of the Nosenko material in the JFK
sequestered collection as “not believed to be relevant”
(NBR). The staff plans to present their proposal to the JFK
Board at the 14 October meeting. The Board requires a
description of all NBRs to be made available to the public.
Please review the attached draft prepared by ARRB staff
member, Michelle Combs, for classification and public
release. The ARRB staff needs a response by COB Thursday if
possible. HRG/DO JFK reviewers here have no problem with
the draft and recommend release. If you have any questions,

call me on 31825. Thanks.

Subject: Files on Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko in the CIA Sequestered Collection

Microfilm Containing Information of No Believed Relevance to the
Assassination of President John F. Kennedy

The information on Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko contained in the CIA Sequestered
Collection microfilm consists of approximately 3600 pages of interviews, transcripts,
memos, and reports. Of the total, approximately 1200 pages have been released to the
public as open in full or with redactions. Of the 1200 released pages, roughly 800
contain information directly relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. Although all of these 800 pages have been released in
redacted form, we have asked the Agency to re-review them under the standards of the
JFK Act before we submit them to the Board.

After my review of the Nosenko records and our discussion of the issues, it is my
judgment that the remaining approximately 2400 pages are unrelated to the
assassination of President Kennedy and should be processed as "NBR." These NBR
records, which are described on the attached list, consist of such items as general family.
and professional contact information, Soviet intelligence methodology, personalities,
and specific operations, and Soviet Navy information dating to Nosenko’s early career
in Soviet Naval Intelligence. Much of the information consists of various attempts by
the Agency in the 1960's to establish Nosenko’s bona fides. The October 1968 Solie
Report, which has been released in redacted form and will be re-reviewed under the
JFK Act, establishes Nosenko’s bona fides. The conclusions of the Solie report were
reaffirmed in a 1976 report by John Hart. A brief summary of the conclusions of the
Hart Report will also be processed for release.

The approximately 2400 pages of proposed Nosenko NBR records have been reviewed
carefully to confirm that they contain no material helpful to a deeper understanding of
the assassination. During the review some additional material, not previously released,
which may add to an understanding of the Nosenko story, was marked relevant and.
identified for processing and review.

SUBJECT: Disclosure of Information on Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko

Sy)

1. The Board intends to deelassity and release for public
consumption, approximately 2400“pages of counterintelligence
staff studies, interrogation reports, file reviews, and bona
fides studies on Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko. These studies contain
sensitive personal and operational material completely unrelated
and irrelevant to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of
President Kennedy. It has been officially stated and documented
that the remaining Nosenko records have been carefully reviewed
to confirm that they contain no material helpful to a deeper
understanding of the assassination. Mr. Nosenko has adhered time
and time again to the stipulations of his Memorandum of
Understanding not to divulge his relationship with this Agency,
even in view of the less than satisfactory conditions this Agency
forced upon him during his early resettlement. Public disclosure
of the remaining documents would constitute an unwarranted
invasion of his personal and professional privacy not to mention
the breech of trust on the part of this Agency to protect his
right of privacy and above all, his security. This trust was
reconfirmed in a personal letter from the former DDO, Ted Price, ©
in September 1994, stating that we would take special steps to
protect any sensitive information touching on Mr. Nosenko’s
private life or on operational information pertaining to his
debriefings. The letter further states that this Agency valued
the sacrifices he made for our country, and every effort would he
made to protect information that could affect. his privacy and ,
security. The question has been asked before. Should we not’
show the same integrity that we expect from those who put their
lives on the line in defense of our national interests?

2. Furthermore, the recruitment of sources of high
intelligence value has always been this Agency’s top priority.
Public disclosure of this information could do irreparable damage
to our ability to attract individuals who admire the US and might
be disposed to collaboration, Disclosure of cooperation with the
USG would cause any potential source to think twice before
placing his life in the hands of an organization who cannot
protect his information. For those individuals such as Mr.
Nosenko, who placed their trust in this country in the past,
entered our resettlement program, and are now US citizens, the
indiscriminate release of information, some of it very personal

| have reviewed the descriptions of the folders proposed by the ARRB Staff. While | see this as a success to have them support our
position and have some concern about the detail included within the descriptions. We had an occasion in the past to ask for a legal
opinion about a former employee's access rights to Nosenko's file and were told he is entitled protection under the Privacy Act. Nosenko
has already personally expressed {in a letter to the Agency) his concern and objection about potential release of information about him. |
think we should carefully consider the amount of detail included in the public release and whether it violates his rights under the Privacy
Act.

J trust the judgment of those that have reviewed these descriptions as to content in relationship to other released material and
classification but | just want to raise a mild concern about the detail contained in the descriptions of folder content. | will not object to
the these if everyone feels compelled to accept them to protect the success we have achieved as long as they are determined to not be in

From: |. Michelle Combs YO

Subject: Files on Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko in the CIA Sequestered Collection
; Microfilm Containing Information of No Believed Relevance to the
Assassination of President John F. Kennedy

The information on Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko contained in the CIA Sequestered
Collection microfilm consists of approximately 3600 pages of interviews, transcripts,
memos, and reports. Of the total, approximately 1200 pages have been released to the
public as open in full or with redactions. Of the 1200 released pages, roughly 800
contain information directly relevant to Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy. Although all of these 800 pages have been released in
redacted form, we have asked the Agency to re-review them under the standards of the
JEK Act before we submit them to the Board.

After my review of the Nosenko records and our discussion of the issues, it is my’
judgment that the remaining approximately 2400 pages are unrelated to the
assassination of President Kennedy and should be processed as "NBR." These NBR
records, which are described on the attached list, consist of such items as general family
and professional contact information, Soviet intelligence methodology, personalities,
and specific operations, and Soviet Navy information dating to Nosenko’s early career
in Soviet Naval Intelligence. Much of the information consists of various attempts by
the Agency in the 1960's to establish Nosenko’s bona fides. The October 1968 Solie
Report, which has been released in redacted form and will be re-reviewed under the -
JFK Act, establishes Nosenko’s bona fides. The conclusions of the Solie report were
reaffirmed in a 1976 report by John Hart. A brief summary of the conclusions of the.
Hart Report will also be Processed for release.

The approximately 2400 pages of proposed Nosenko NBR records have been reviewed
carefully to confirm that they contain no material helpful to a deeper understanding of
the assassination. During the review some additional material, not previously released,
which may add to an understanding of the Nosenko story, was marked relevant and
identified for processing and review. ;

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Discussions with Center for the Study of
Intelligence on the Release of Material Relating
to Yuriy Nosenko :

1. On 3 August L had a series of discussions with the
staff of, the Center for the Study of Intelligence (CSI) at.
the Center's office in the Ames Building. Our discussion °
centered on the disposition of more than 3,200 pages
relating to the career of former KGB officer--and current
CIA independent contractor-~Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko. The
@ocuments are being reviewed for declassification and
release as required by the JFK law.

2. The Declassification Problem: CSI's de-
Classification staff has carefully reviewed the Nosenko
material. Ellie Neiman--a career Directorate of Operations
officer-~is representing the DO in the review process.

Ms. Neiman noted that the material can be divided into two
parts:

* Approximately 800 pages that deal with Nosenko's infor-
mation about Lee Harvey Oswald's life in the Soviet Union
- and his relationship with the KGB. .

¢ A body of counterintelligence staff studies, inter-
rogation reports, file reviews, and bona fides studies on
Nosenko totaling some 2,400 pages. These studies contain
sensitive personal and operational material. For
example: :

-- Information on how CIA conducted operations in
Moscow ("sticks and bricks"), material on how
bona fides analysis is conducted, and details on
how we evaluated the KGB's operations.

SUBJECT: Discussions with the Center for the Study of
Intelligence on the Release of Material Relating

to Yuriy Nosenko . -

-- Extensive personal details on US citizens the KGB.
assessed and pitched (approximately 100 cases) :
and on Americans Moscow Station used as assets.

One US citizen the KGB developed is now a

senior professor of history in California.

3. Nosenko's Sensitivities: I discussed with

Ms. Neiman Nosenko's concern about the impact of the release
of information on his personal life. I informed hef.-of
Nosenko's recent letter to the DCI complaining about the |
release of material related to his association with CIA, and
of his concern that future releases would endanger his
privacy and security. The bona fides studies dwell in great
detail on Nosenko's personal life, including his problems

-with venereal disease and his relationships with women.

Since the bona fides were based on detailed analyses of
Nosenko's life, their release would reveal modus operandi of
sensitive clandestine operations and further embarrass a man
who has served as a CIA employee for more than three

decades. .
4. Following my discussions with Ms. Neiman, I met
with John Pereira, Acting Director of CSI, and Barry
Harrelson, a member of his staff. I recommended. that CIA .
move to release the material dealing with Oswald, but--
citing the operational costs, embarrassment to prominent
American citizens, and threat to Nosenko's privacy--strongly
suggested that the other material be held back. Mr. Pereira
agreed to take these points into consideration, noting that
the law did allow CIA to withhold certain information to
protect national security or for reasons of privacy. He
told me in closing that later this year.the Agency would
have to justify to the Congressionally-mandated review board
the reasons for withholding. I promised that I would raise
the issue with the Chief of the Counterintelligence Center
and said. I believed we could provide the justification.

time did the control or responsibility over Nosenko change from the Soviet
Russia Division to another division? .
Mr, Murpny, My recollection is that it changed in the spring or early summer
of 1967 and the responsibility was turned over to the Office of Security of which
Solfe was a member. . :
Mr. Kretn. As Chief of the Soviet Russia Division, did you have the primary
responsibility for what happened to Nosenko? And when I say happened, where

Hitlers have to consider, Mr. Kiziw. There came a time in 1964, April 4, I believe, when the treatment

at he could be lying about Oswald and received by Nosenko greatly changed in that hostile interrogations began, is that
e was lying about Oswald. Mr. Murrey. I am not sure I agree with the formulation of the question.

: Mr. Kein. Well, elaborate. :

he was about . Mr. Moar. No; the previous pattern of voluntary discussion of issues under
whether’ Sout Osvald, do you think that consideration changed and Nosenko was not permitted to evade questions or to

decide when he would or would not want to respond.
Mr. Kien. Could you describe for us. what the pattern was before, as far as
conditions and how it was changed?

13-00000

532

Mr. MurrHy. Well, the pattern before was one of pretty much permitting.
Nosenko to call.the shots. In other words, we wanted his cooperation and we:

-wanted to discuss these things in a reasonable manner, but his preference was

not to sit still for a full day’s briefing, to want to go out socially ali the time,
which made it difficult the next day to continue to work. And the most important
aspect, I think, of the change was the decision to confront him with inconsisten-
cies as opposed to taking what he said and passing it on.

Mr. Kix1n. What about the day-to-day living conditions, were they changed?

Mr. Munpuy. Well, be was not permitted to leave. He was not permitted to
depart,

Mr. Kuern. Other than that, his day-to-day treatment, not the actual interroga-

. tion sessions, but his food intake, his recreation, was that, changed at that time?

Mr. Mogpuy. I don't think so, not.that early. I don’t” ‘rémember™ that:

* * * . . s .

Mr. Kein. Subsequent to April 4, is it ‘correct that Nosenko was interrogated
by people from the Soviet Russia Division?

(Mr, Murrnry. That is right.

Mr. Kxzin. And how were the particular subareas on which he was interrogated
chosen?

(Mr. Muspiy. I am not sure. I don’t know. Subject areas? This is a guess, this is _
a recollection, but I think the decision was made based on what the CIA people
thought offered the best opportunity to get an admission and to break on that.
In other words, I think it' was based on points that they had collateral on. By '
that I mean other information which sald what this man is saying is not the truth -
or this man does not know about this and, therefore, let us hit him hard on this: -
And so it was a fully tactical, these were tactical considerations relating to pos-
session of information in the hands of the interrogators. which then offered the
best opportunity to get through and get the truth.

\One breakthrough it was felt, as is normally the case, gives you other break- .
throughs. The decision on what ‘subjects to be interrogated} was essentially a fac.
tor of the tactics of the debriefing.

Mr. KLeIn. Would it.be fair to say that after April 4 the subject areas were
determined by a desire to try to catch him, to break him, as opposed to a desire
to gain knowledge that would be of use to you in your role as an intelligence
agency? In other words, knowledge of the operation. .

Mr. Muzpuy. That is an accurate impression. The answer is yes because by
the end of April there was a view that the man was not telling the truth, that
parts of what he was saying were known to be untrue and that, therefore, made
no sense, and although the reasons for his behavior and his statements were
not clear, it made no sense then, it did not appear to make sense to accept as
valid any data he might provide unless you could be sure that that data was in
fact correct, and there were so many doubts about this, leaving aside the moti-
vation for it, the contradictions or the way in which he presented it, that the
information was not considered acceptable.

* * * s . *. *

Mr. Krer. Were you aware of the substance of what Nosenko had to say about
Oswa’

Mr. Murpry. From the very frst. I mean, when he first said it back in February
or March.

Mr. Kue1n. Do you recall now the substance of it?

- Mr: Murpny. No; not exactly, anything I said would be polluted by so much
back and forth, I know that the thrust of the message was that Oswald was
never of interest to the Soviet Intelligence Services, that he was never debriefed
by them, and I can guarantee that because I was personally involved in the
affair. There is more detail, but I can’t really pin it down.

Mr. Kier. Did you accept this statement by Nosenko?

Mr. Murpuy. I did not. I did not believe that it would be possible for the
Soviet Intelligence Services to have remained indifferent to the arrival in 1959
in Moscow of a former Marine radar operator who had served at what was an
active U-2 operational base. I found that to be strange. It was only later, I think,
that as the Nosenko case and its other ramifications began to emerge that it

ied to me that the Oswald story became even more unusual.

I think I mentioned the other day it seems to me almost to have been tacked on

the other things that he had to say, many of which were true. You understand
that Nosenko was—much of what he said was true. :

Mr. Kern. You are talking about other areas? :o
Mr. Murpny. Yes, sir. This one seemed to be tacked on and didn’t have much

relationship, and it seemed to be so totally dependent on not just one coincidence

but a whole series of coincidences, for him to have been there.and all that sort
of thing. That is what F mean. ~ : .
* . = s .

Mr. Kier. Do you recall any other specifics about what you could not accept
in Nosenko’s statements about Oswald?

Mr. Muzruy. Yes, that they just—this {s part.of the first one—no contact was .
ever made, that he went up to. Minsk and lived happily and well with no contact.
The ‘Soviet Union with foreigners don’t do that,-I mean, he is the only person.
Read the accounts of what happened to this poor. gentleman, what happened to
Jay Crawford in Moscow and their intensive debriefing of him on the layout of
the American Embassy. It didn't seem to be possible. f

Now, again, that does not constitute proof, doesn’t constitute any breakthrough.
It seemed to me to de strange. : ae

Mr. Kier. Would you-distinguish between first the fact: that nobody debriefed
Oswald when he first came to the Soviet Union, nobody tried to find out what he
knew as a marine, a8 a radar operator, and, second, the fact that once they
deéided to allow him to stay, nobody debriefed him to “out if he was some
kind of a Western security agent or working for OIA?

Mr, Munexy. Yes, they would be two different point
involves the KGB and GRU. This is simply a chap arriving with this background
and no one taking the time just from a military intelligence technical point of
view, telling us how it worked when this thing came in at 90,000 feet what did the
blips look like. I don’t think they had many American radar operators handling
operational traffic involving U-2's. * o

Mr. Kieu. How would you react to a statement by Nosenko that although
the KGB knew Oswald was a marine, they did not bother to question him,
and because of that, never knew that he was a radar operator or that he
worked at the base from which the U-2's took off and landed?

‘Mr, Murray. I think it would be strange.

My other point, going back to your first question, that is, the first aspect of
your question, which is the initial arrival and lack of debriefing. There is no
indication here that the GRU was advised, which in the case of a defector,
there is no operational interest in a defector. GRU would be properly the out-
fit that would want to be talking to any marine. They will talk to a marine
about close order drill You follow me? It doesn’t require that he be known to

I realize that there is a body of thought which says that some people think
the Soviets are 10-foot tall I don’t believe they are. I think they are very,
very, very muck the other way. What I find difficult on the part of many Ameri-
cans is that they will not ascribe to the Soviets the ‘same elemental competence
that we have. That is all I ask. And, therefore, we in Germany will talk to a
private in the Hast German Border Guards, The GRU would be interested
in talking to a private. He was a corporal in the Marine Corps, who had stated
to a consul in a consular office, which is manned by the Soviets, Soviet locals

Embassy, that he wanted to talk about his experiences, that he wanted to tell all.
I guess I found it difficult to believe this is one of the things that made, or many
other aspects of the case, but this is one of the things that created an atmosphere

- of disbelief that there must be something to this case that Is important, vitally

important to the.Soviet Union and we can't understand it. :
nett may be right, he may be right, but at the time it was very hard to
leve. :

Mr. Kcsrn. And on the basis of your experience and knowledge gained over
almost 30 years, is that what is giving you trouble with Nosenko’s statements
about Oswald? -

Mr. Murray. And other things. —

Mr. Krern. Do you know of comparable situations where somebody wasn't
questioned like this, was just left alone, as Nosenko says Oswald wiis?

Mr, Mugexy. I honestly couldn’t find anyone, or I am not aware of anyone
that the division or the CI Staff, that is, those officers concerned with this

-. case, were handling it directly. I don’t know of any former Soviet intelligence

officer or other knowledgeable source to whom they spoke about this matter
who felt this would have been possible. If someone did, I never heard of it.

Mr, Kiet. During this interrogation period, beginning in April 1964, would
it be fair to say that the questions relating to Oswald and the problems which
you have just been discussing relating to Oswald constituted a major area
for questioning and in interrogating Nosenko?

Mr. Murpxy. Probaby not.

Mr. Kieu. Why would that have been?

Mr. Morpny. Because there were many other areas which posed. equally inter-
esting aspects yet about which we knew much more and which had occurred
abroad and involved collateral knowledge, which obviously is not easy for us
to obtain in the Soviet Union.

Mr. Kiern. Who in the Soviet ‘Russia, division made the decision as to who.
would question Nosenko, subsequent to April 4?

Mr. Murry. (OJA employee], chief of the group.

Mr. KLEIN. And do you know of any criteria that he used to ‘piek” his inter-
rogators

Mr..Murpur. Some knowledge of Russian, as Nosenko's English was not good,
the fact that he had been exposed. Well, that is one of the aspects of the CIA
interrogation. You try not to use too many people because you then lose. In the
first: place, you are dealing with a potentially hostile guy who is Mable to go

* back to the Soviet Union, or return to the other side, and so you don’t want to

expose too many officers, plus the fact it is not a good idea to simply bring a lot ;
of people in. You have to have people who studied the case and became in depth, ©
know it in depth and therefore, so they use the officers that they had available
and there were a variety of criteria. ©

Mr. Kiern. As I mentioned to you in our conversations about a week ago, it is
‘our information that the person who interrogated Nosenko about the Oswald
matter had no background whatsoever in Oswald, he didn’t know anything
about Oswald’s background or really about Oswald at all. Is. there any reason
that such a person would be used. that you can tell us?

Mr. Mugpuy. I am not sure I understand. I thought the point was that he had,
he was not a man of a lot of background in the CI debriefings or interrogations.
I wasn’t sure of the point he didn’t know. about Oswald. I am not sure very
many of us knew very much about Oswald than was available at the time.

Mr. Kier. Two points——

Mr. Mogrpxy. The reason that the chap was chosen was because he was level-
headed, extremely toughminded, and was going to be with the case for the
long pull. He was not going to be changed. That is why he was used. And his
career since then has borne out the judgment of many, he is a very good officer.

Mr. Krzr. But wouldn’t——

Mr. Murpxy. I don’t know that he didn’t, that he wasn’t what you are saying,
he knew nothing at all about Oswald's case. I find that difficult to believe. But I
don’t know.

Mr, Kurt. well, if I asked you to consider a hypothetical situation, where I
told you the officer who interrogated Oswald knew nothing about Oswald other
than what he learned from Nosenko, would you think that was unusual that
they would not, if they didn’t have somebody already who knew about Oswald, at
least given somebody a thorough briefing from A to Z, everything that the CIA
knew about Oswald, would you think it was unusual, that they didn’t do that?

Mr. Mogpry. I would certainly think.so.

Mr. Kixetn. The second part of my question was the other point I made to you
a week ago when we spoke, to our knowledge, let me be frank, we spoke to the
particular officer in a deposition, so that our knowledge is gained from that,
it is possible that since I have not seen the typed up deposition that what I say
might not be exactly what the deposition says, but my recollection of it is that
he also had little or no prior interrogation experience, and my question is would

it be—

Mr. Morpny. That wouldn’t surprise me because there were very few people,
relatively few people, in the Division or indeed elsewhere who had a lot of
interrogation experience. We hadn't done a lot of very many hostile CIA debrief-
ings. People who might have been used were probably otherwise, either abroad, -

sion; and Mr. Harold F. Riese from the Office of Legal Counsel
the Justice Department. :
The meeting took place in Mr. Katzenbach’s office in the Justice
. Department. The purpose of the meeting was to define Mr. Nosen-
ko’s legal status in the United States and to anticipate what kind
‘of legal problems might arise in connection with the Agency’s
ongoing custody of Mr. Nosenko.

*s The Agency provided me a copy of the memorandum for the
_ ecord written by Mr. Lawrence Houston describing this meeting
on. April 2, 1964, and a second memorandum which reflects the
‘substance of a telephone call from Mr. Foley on the following day,

Agency on September 18, 1978, and I would like to. make them part

meeting is something he was. not responsible:for as. far as I am
aware.

Let me read to you the memorandum for the record which Mr.
Lawrence R. Houston, the General Counsel of CIA, wrote on April
3, 1964. I have a copy in front of me. It is headed Memorandum for
the Record and the subject is the Nosenko case.:

it reads:

Yeagley, William E. and Harold F. Ries, on A; 2, 1964. Mr. Helms outlined
the problems foreseeable; in our future relations with Nosenko and asked the opi

ion of the Justice representatives on what we. could do to control the situation. I
pointed out. that his technical status is one of exclusion and parole—or more
technically, deferment and parole.

Paragraph 2:

After some discussion, Mr. Foley stated it was his opinion that ncy representa-
tives could take any action n to fo carry out the terms of the parole. Mr.
Katzenbach asked Mr. Fole: let me know and Mr. Foley. later

signed by Lawrence R. Houston, General Counsel. It is a memoran-

' dum for the director of security. That would be the officer who was

the director of the security office of the Central Intelligence
Agency. The subject is Parole status of defectors:

On 2 April 1964, we had a discussion with the Department of Justice on the status

(Commercial break]
Case Closed

BARBARA WALTERS: The Kennedy assassination was back in the headlines all this
week when mare than 900,000 pages of previously classified government files were

finally opened after nearly 30 years. And while close to half the current

population wasn't even alive at the time, the controversy surrounding that event
continues to haunt us all.

The fact is a majority of Americans don't believe the Warren Commission, and do
believe some farm of conspiracy was involved. But now, a powerful new book
claims to have the last word. Its conclusion? Lee Harvey Oswald did indeed act
alone. The book is titled Case Closed, but is it?

(voice-over) Whatever side you're on in this still-raging controversy, you'll
want to see Lynn Sherr's report now.

LYNN SHERR, ABC News: Cvoice-aver] No period in an American presidency has been
as controversial, as thoroughly analyzed or as frequently written and speculated
about as the final six seconds in John F. Kennedy's life. ;

1st NEWSCASTER: £€?1 Three shots were fired at the President's motorcade as it
passed out of the downtown area of Dallas. ;

SHERR: [voice-over] No detail about the final moments of the President's life
has been spared scrutiny. Every eyewitness account, ballistics test, photograph,
medical conclusion and investigative finding has been challenged, reinterpreted
or dismissed, then woven into countless theories. Far three decades, an already
skeptical American public has been left wondering if we would ever earn the
truth about what happened in Dealey (sp?] Plaza on November 22, 1963.

SHERR: The official version of what happened is that from that sixth-floor
corner window, acting alone, Lee Harvey Oswald fired three shots, the third of
which ended the life of America's 35th president. But that's too simple an
explanation for a great many Americans, and for conspiracy theorists, far too
convenient that one man alone did it. Doubters insist that the shot or shats
that killed the President came from behind that fence on the grassy knoll, or
from a railroad averpass just beyond.

MARK LANE, Author/Attorney: Shots came from at least two directions. A bullet

‘hit the President in the back. A bullet hit him in the throat. It came from the

front. A bullet hit him in the head. It came from the front. That was three
shots. At least one bullet hit Governor Connolly (sp?], One bullet missed,
struck the curb. :

SHERR: [voice-over] Attarney/author Mark Lane, one of the most persistent and
prolific of conspiracy theorists, has long insisted that the Warren Commission

‘was wrong, and covered up critical evidence that might make it possible to

identify the President's assassins.

Mr. LANE: Today, with hundreds of thousands af documents in the vaults of the
CIA, the DI C2], and the FBI and the National Archives ~ which we can't see ~
the cover-up is continuing.

SHERR: Cvoice-over] But another lawyer-turned-author, Gerald Posner, says
evidence available to researchers and conspiracy buffs for years led him
directly ta the only person who could possibly have shot the President.

GERALD POSNER, Author, ‘Case Closed': Lee Harvey Oswald killed Jack Kennedy,
acting alone.

SHERR: Cvoice-over] Posner, author of Case Closed, the culmination of a
three-year, exhaustive reexamination of the Kennedy assassination, concedes that
in identifying a familiar culprit, he's not likely to win aver many conspiracy
buffs. But he says the evidence didn't allow far any other suspects.

Mir. POSNER: Most peaple who have written conspiracy books started with their
conclusion already done. They knew it was a conspiracy in their heart, and they
went around to prove that case.

- SHERR: {Cvoice-over] One of the major assassination controversies Posner seeks to .

resolve is the number of shots fired, where they came from, and which ones
struck the President. Using recently-developed computer enhancements of the home
movie taken by Abraham Zapruder, Posner explained for 20/20 how he says he was
able to count the shots, for which he says Oswald had more time than the Warren
Commission believed. ,

Mir. POSNER: Oswald's first shot, which missed, was fired much earlier than
anyone realized - just after the car turned the corner. Evidence of this is
overlooked by most experts. It's in the film. In the upper righthand corner of
your screen, you'll see a little girl. She's heard that shot and turned. In the
car, the President and Mrs. Kennedy and the Governor also heard the shot and

turned. After this shot, Oswald, still had aver eight seconds, not five, for the
next two. .

The second shot is fired. This bullet hits bath Kennedy and Connolly. After
passing through Kennedy, you see it go through the Governor, a5 his suit lapel
flaps forward. A computer technician discovered that crucial detail just last
year. .

SHERR: Cvoice-aver] This is the so-called ‘magic bullet‘ that seemed to zigzag
through the two men.

Mr. POSNER: This computer animation illustrates that the second bullet needed no
magic. Because of the way the two men were lined up, this bullet passed directly
through them. [t turned only after it slowed dawn and shattered Connolly's wrist —
- no zigs, no zags.

SHERR: How could that bullet have emerged so clean, with na flaws on it, really,
whatsoever?

Mir. POSNER: I was skeptical about that bullet, and I think that was the thing
that stops many people from believing Oswald did it alone. It emerged so clean
because that it went through Kennedy, it Slowed up. When it went through
Connolly's chest, it slowed up. By the time it hit the big bone in his wrist,
which everybody thinks would damage it, it was traveling at half or a third of
its speed - fast enough to crush the bone, but not fast enough to deform the
bullet.

SHERR: Cvoice-aver] The sudden backward motion of the President's head as the
third and final bullet struck, blowing away part of his skull, has led many to
believe that the shot came from the front, but Posner says normal neurological
reflexes make the body stiffen when struck, causing it to move back.

And Dr. Pepper Jenkins, one of the physicians attending the President at
Parkland Hospital, points to yet another possible factor, the brace President
Kennedy wore for his chronic back pain.

Dr. PEPPER JENKINS: He was so tightly wound into a brace that- the metal coming
up his back, and he was tied to the metal or strapped to the metal with an Ace
bandage.

SHERR: In the Zapruder film and in all the pictures we've seen- well, haw do you
describe what the body is doing, having seen the brace?

Dr. JENKINS: Well, I would think you couldn' t fall forward. I think you'd have
to fall backwards or aside.

SHERR: Because?
Dr. JENKINS: Because the brace held him in such a position.

and NEWSCASTER: (71 At approximately. one o'clock, the President is dead. The
doctors were working too frantically to revive him to notice the exact moment.

Dr. JENKINS: She had such a drawn look. I really feel like she was in shock, and
she was just holding her hands, one above the other. And one of the times, she
nudged me with her elbow and handed me something in her hand, which is part of
his brain that obviously was in her lap- with his head in her lap as the car
came to Parkland. Bad moment.

SHERR: Cvoice-over] After examining computer animation of the presidential
limousine and its passengers, Posner sought to show where in Dealey Plaza, the
shots came fram.

fir. POSNER: Kennedy and Connolly are placed into computer animation, and working
back from their wounds, the computer determines the only possible location for
the assassin, as indicated by the yellow shading. Notice that Oswald's
Ssixth-floor window is right in the center of it.

Mr. LANE: Posner believes the magic-bullet theory. Next, I guess, we're going tao
hear about the Tooth Fairy. It's just mathematically impossible. No one has ever
been able ta recreate what it is said that Lee Harvey Oswald did.

SHERR: Well, they've done it- he's done it now with a computer enhancement-—
Mr. LANE: I know that.

SHERR: -and he claims the computer shows that it's absolutely the way it
happened.

Mr. LANE: Well, he's entitled to his computer. The American people were there,
and they testified, and two-thirds of them said they know shots came from the
wooden fence.

SHERR: [voice-over] What about that reported fourth shot fired from the grassy
knoll? When the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in 1978 that
there was a 95-percent certainty of such a shot, conspiracy theorists were
heartened, but the committee's finding, according to Dallas Sheriff Jim Bowles
(sp?], was based on a static-filled Dictabelt recording of a Dallas police
motorcycle radio stuck in the on position. The sheriff says the motorcycle
wasn't even in Dealey Plaza, but the committee heard four shots, We couldn't

hear any.

Cinterviewing] You have a copy of that tape, right?

Sheriff JIM BOWLES, Dallas: I certainly do.

SHERR: Why don't you play it, and let's take a listen. Is that a shot?
‘Sheriff BOWLES: No, that’s the motorcycle slowing down, see?

SHERR: I didn't hear any shots.

Sheriff BOWLES: Neither has anyone else. They listened to the same belts we
listened to, and they claimed to hear four shots.

SHERR: So where do you think the four shots came from on the House Select
Committee's tape?

Sheriff BOWLES: You have to ask them.

Mir. POSNER: They clearly went down the wrong path. The National Academy of
Sciences reviewed their work later, and pointed out all the flaws in it. They
just made an error on that Dictabelt. There is no fourth ‘shot. There's na shot
at all, even, to hear.

SHERR: Even if people accepted the physical evidence gathered here in Dealey
Plaza, and agreed that it tended to support the Warren Commission's findings,
that would not end the speculation. Surveys show that most Americans doubt that
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, believing instead that he was either part of or
himself became a victim of a conspiracy.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: I didn't shat anybody, no, sir.
3rd NEWSCASTER: C2] Oswald has been shat!

SHERR: What about the Ruby- the Jack Ruby-organized crine connection? Clearly,
there was a connection there.

Mr. POSNER: No question. Asa matter of fact, I think the Warren coamisston
underplayed Jack Ruby's organized. crime connections.

SHERR: Isn't there some evidence, then, that he might have been acting on their
behalf ta wipe out Oswald?

Mr. POSNER: Right. No. If he had a contract from organized crime, why didn't he
shoot Oswald when he saw him for the first time two days earlier? On the day.
Ruby finally killed Oswald, it was only by chance that their paths crossed. He
was not acting on behalf of organized crime. He was acting for his awn
motivation, this desire, as he thought, to be a hero in Dallas, that he would
erase the stain and the stigna attached to the city that had‘been done by the
President's murder.

SHERR: You're saying Jack Ruby acted all by himself,.a lone-gunman theory once.
again?

Mr. POSNER: Without any doubt.

SHERR: Evoice-over] Posner also explained his views on the many canspiracy
theories about the assassination.

ROBERT F. KENNEDY: Did you say, ‘That S.0.B., I'l] break his back'?
JIMMY HOFFA: Who?
. KENNEDY: You.
Mr. HOFFA: Who's the ‘who'?

SHERR: The Mafia wanted the President killed, because that would get rid of
Bobby Kennedy, who was going after organized crime.

table with some of its key henchman, and discussed killing President Kennedy.
They did hate him. They might have even had a conspiracy afoot. There is no tie
between Lee Harvey Oswald and organized crime. There's not opportunity for him
to have been their assassin. In essence, he beat the Mafia ta Kennedy.

SHERR: How about, as in the Oliver Stone movie, JFK, the military industrial
complex?

Mr. POSNER: The movie, JFK, served what I call the kitchen sink. If you can't
just have one of them, let's have everybody in the plot, because they all have
some reason to knock off Kennedy.

‘JIM GARRISON: We have the mystery of the assassination of the President solved,
and there is no question about it.

SHERR: What about the Garrison investigation?

Mr. POSNER: He had great delusions on the assassination. 1 think it’s a
disgrace. It was a travesty of justice, a miscarriage of justice. Garrison knew
it. I discovered files of his investigation - documents, affidavits, memos from
his investigators - which showed the extent of this scam that was pulled an the
American public. Here was a'man who knew better. I think his behavior actually

crossed the line to being criminal.

SHERR: Is there any evidence- do you believe at all that Lee Harvey Oswald was
working on behalf of the CIA to kill the President? ;

Mr. POSNER: No. I don't believe the CIA had any connection, not only to kill the
President, but they had no connection to Oswald at all. And the reason that I

can say that so confidently to you is actually an unusual source. It's the KGB
files. The KGB files, which had surveillance on Oswald for day in and day out .
for nearly two years in Russia, came to the conclusion that he was not a sleeper
agent, that he had no American intelligence contact.

SHERR: [voice-over] So if Oswald wasn't working for the CIA, how about the KGB?
After all, he spoke Russian, defected to the Soviet Union in 1959, married, a
Russian, and lived in Minsk for two years.

‘Mr. POSNER: A popular early theory, popular that we now see in the documents
just released this past week in Washington. The KGB was high on the CIA's
possible list of targets. The KGB did not want Oswald from day one. They
realized Oswald had problems, psychological problems.

URI NOSENKO, Former KGB Agent: (sp?] I do not think that Oswald will be trusted
by any intelligence.

SHERR: Cvoice-over] Uri Nosenko is someone who might know. Before defecting to
the United States in 1963, Nosenko was Oswald's KGB handler, and had access tao
his file. He insists Oswald never worked for the KGB. Still concerned about his
own safety, Nosenko asked 20/20 not to show his face. :

Mr. NOSENKO: Lee Harvey Oswald was mentally unstable.

SHERR: Cvoice-over] But unlike Posner, Nasenko says he doesn't believe Oswald
could have shot the President for a very simple reason.

Mir. NOSENKO: In Minsk, he was shooting rabbits with shotgun. Would: you believe

it? He never shoot a single rabbit. And here we see person shoating rifle on a
long distance, and shooting three, four shots in several seconds. :

Mr. POSNER: He didn‘t get a rabbit, and therefore that's used as evidence that
he couldn't kill the President? But talk to those who actually knew what Oswald
was like with a gun, his brother who used to go out with him.

ROBERT OSWALD, Brother: We have shot cottontail rabbits with .22's on the run,
okay? We've shot squirrels in the trees with .22's.

SHERR: Lvoice~over] Robert Oswald says his younger brother was always interested

‘in guns. He still has the pistol Lee Oswald bought when he was 16.

Mir. OSWALD: My experience with him in the field with a shotgun or a .22 was he
usually gat his game.

SHERR: [voice-over] And Lee Harvey Oswald used the same rifle that killed the
President only weeks earlier in a failed attempt to murder to retired Army
general Edwin Walker. In other words, according to author Gerald Posner, Oswald,
a loser in life, wanted to accomplish something.

MAN: C7] Lee Harvey Oswald, 0, S, W, A, L, D.
REPORTER: Did you fire that rifle?

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: That's the facts that you people have been getting, but I
emphatically deny these charges.

SHERR: Cvoice~-over] If, as you say, Lee Harvey Oswald was not working with the
mob or with the CIA or with the KGB or with the military industrial complex, why
did he kill the President?

Mr. POSNER: [ think that Oswald killed the President, because this was to he
almost his fulfillment, his moment in the sun. Three-days. before Kennedy arrives
in Dallas, he's given a gift on a silver platter. Jack Kennedy's going to pass
in front af the Depository. It's nat ideology, it's not because he's Communist,
but it's because he has that opportunity to place himself in history. Here we
are, 30 years later, talking about him. He was successful. He got his wish.

WALTERS: Well, there's a lot of proof. Is the case closed?

SHERR: Well, certainly, Gerald Posner believes s0, but out experience is that
people on the other side are so dug in, it's unlikely anything is going to
change their mind. You know, even at Dealey Plaza, there are people just walking
around, telling you what their theories are. And incidentally, Barbara, Dealey

HEADLINE: THE CASE AGAINST CONSPIRACY ;
GERALD POSNER, ACTING ALONE, HAS WOUNDED THE JK COVER-UP INDUSTRY

BYLINE: By Paul Galloway, Tribune Staff Writer.

BODY:
The rendezvous was arranged for a weeknight last fall at a Turkish restaurant
near CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. The proprietor would be expecting hia.

When author Gerald Posner said he was there to meet George and his wife, as
he had been instructed to do, the proprietor led Posner and his wife, Trisha, to
a private table in the back room.

George was the cade name for Yuri Nosenko, a KGB officer who defected to the
U.S. in 1964 and now Lives under another name in an undisclosed part of the’
country. Posner was researching a book about the assassination of John F.
Kennedy, and Nosenko had agreed to speak for the first time exclusively. about
the Soviet intelligence agency's surveillance of Lee Harvey Oswald during his
stay in the Soviet Union from late 1959 until June 1962. Nasenko had suggested
that he and Posner bring their wives, Posner said, because the sight of twa
couples dining together would serve as cover for their interview.

"Yuri supervised the Oswald file in Moscow and was familiar with the K&B
_ files on Oswald‘s time in Minsk, which I had seen," Posner said. "I knew he
could be extremely helpful in reconstructing that period 9f Oswald's life."

A chapter in Pasner's new book, “Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the
Assassination of JFK," is devoted to Nosenko and his assessments of Oswald.

As the title suggests, Posner finds Oswald to be Kennedy's assassin, acting
alone, just as the Warren Commission said. Further, he was not a CIA agent, not
a KGB agent, not an innocent patsy but a sociopath and loser who had grandiase
notions of making a mark in history.

Posner is as surprised at the book's “conclusion as the conspiracy buffs are
riled.

"I'm getting some very personal, vindictive calls from the conspiracy people.
If it's any consolation, I never set out to do a book that would say here is the
final answer, here is who did it," Posner said during a visit to Chicago.

Posner's intention was to write a primer of sorts about the assassination

after examining the welter of conspiracy theories to see what was credible and
what wasn't.

Poking in the garbage

“When you read all the conspiracy books, it's apparent they can't all be
right because they flatly contradict each other," he said. "“! knew there was
garbage on the record. I didn’t know how much."

; After he debunked as many inaccuracies and false leads as he could, he
assumed there would be some issues that would reguire further investigation,
perhaps questions about acoustics or ballistics or possible Mafia involvement.

Yet toward the end of his research, Posner notified Bob Loomis, his editor at
Random House, that he had taken an unexpected turn.

“Iwas convinced the Warren Commission had gotten it right. The evidence was
averwhelming," he said.

Posner also was aware, of course, that a large majority of the populace
thinks the Warren Commission had gotten it wrong, maybe on purpose.

He gat a feel for such skepticism when Loomis, vice president and executive
editor of Random House, took his own poll at the next meeting of the publishing
house's top editors, who periodically gather to report on works in progress,

“Bob told them about what I'd found and asked how many believed the Warren”
Commission was right," Posner said. "Remember, these are some of the brightest,
best-informed, best-educated people in New York City, and no one raised a hand
except Bob Loomis."

Posner was not dismayed. “When people cite polls showing 70 or 80 or even 90
percent of the public as believing the assassination was the result of a
conspiracy, I say I'm surprised it's not 100 percent when you consider that
people have essentially heard only one side for three decades."

'JFK' an ‘abomination’

A 1978 congressional investigation estimated that 2,000 books, including
those that are self-published, had been written on the subject. All but a
handful present a variety of sometimes-elaborate scenarios about plotters,
motives, killers and cover-ups, and as a rule, the conspiracy books make
bestseller lists, while the others don't.

“Then there are the TV documentaries, which are invariably pro-conspiracy,"
Posner said. "A recent one was a five-hour British film for Arts & Entertainment
called ‘The Men Who Killed Kennedy.' “

And most influential of all, he said, is Oliver Stone's $50 million movie,
"JFK," released in late 1991.

"Half of our country's present population weren't born (as of) November 1963.
Stone's mavie is a historical abomination that's filled with demonstrable
falsehoods, but to young peaple, it's a documentary.

"Even if they read articles criticizing it, they say, ‘Well, Stone may have

exaggerated, but there's got to be something there.' Believe it or not, there's
not." ;

Chicago Tribune, October 3, 1993

What's especially galling, Posner said, is that Stone based his movie on the
investigation of former New Orleans District Atty. Jim Garrison, including his
prosecution of businessman Clay Shaw as an alleged conspirator.

“Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw was disgraceful, criminal and has been
thoroughly discredited. There was coercion of witnesses and changing of —
testimony," Posner said. "The jury took only 45 minutes to find Shaw not guilty,
and one of the jurors said it would have been 20 minutes but that several jurors
had to go to the bathroom,"

Stone has said "JFK" was a “counter-myth" to the "myth" of the Warren
Commission.

The no-Longer magic bullet

Among the doctrines of conspiracy literature bolstered by "SEK, “ Posner
noted, is that the so-called magic bullet found on Texas Gov. John Connally's
stretcher at Parkland Hospital was almost pristine, couldn't have struck Kennedy .
and Connally, as the Warren Commission said it did, without zigzagging in
midair, and was probably planted.

"If ballistics tests didn't prove conclusively the bullet struck Kennedy. and
Connally, which they do, use your common sense," Pasner said. “At the time the -
bullet was found, the conspirators wouldn't know if the bullets fired at
Connally and Kennedy were still lodged in their bodies or had been recovered.

“If they wanted to shield the conspiracy, there can only be three shots.
More than that, and the single assassin doesn't have time to shoot. So why risk
exposing the conspiracy by planting a fourth bullet that wouldn't match
ballistically with remnants of the other rounds?"

And what about Jack Ruby, the Chicago native who moved to Dallas to run strip
clubs? Did he just happen by the Dallas jail on Nov. 24 and shoot Oswald on the
spur of the moment?

"Ruby's murder of Oswald does more to undermine this case in terms of getting
the truth out than anything: else," Posner said. “First, it prevents the trial of
Oswald, where the evidence would have convicted him. It also gives us a second
assassin, with ties to organized crime. It's hard for people to believe this was
a coincidence, so you're off and running with a conspiracy."

Posner's account of Ruby’ s life and his actions during the assassination week

demolishes any notion he was a conspirator.

According to the trade journal Publishers Weekly, six books by major
publishers will appear this fall to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the
assassination, with "Case Closed" standing alone in its anti-conspiracy stance.

Posner has been heartened by promising sales and positive reviews. "Many
readers are put off by conspiracy books that select only material that's
favorable to their position, whether it checks out or not. I think these people
are buying the book."

Three weeks after its release, it is eighth on The New York Times national
best-seller list and seventh on the Tribune's List of Chicago's best sellers.

U.S. News & World Report, which ran excerpts from "Case Closed," writes:
“Posner achieves the unprecedented. He sweeps away decades of polemical smoke,
layer by layer, and builds an unshakable case against JFK's killer . . . Lee
Harvey Oswald." It quotes. Stephen Ambrose, biographer of Dwight Eisenhower and
Richard Nixon: "The chapter on the (magic) bullet is a tour de force, absolutely
brilliant, absolutely convincing."

New York Times book critic Christopher Lehmann-Haupt writes that “Posner
effectively refutes hundreds of claims that have added up to conspiracy
eories."

In a Tribune review, authar Jeffrey Toobin writes that "Case Closed" is
“utterly canvincing in its thesis, which seems, in light of all that has
transpired over the past 30 years, almost revolutionary."

Pasner, 39, didn't set out to be a writer, instead complying with the wishes
of his father, a union official in San Francisco. "My father dealt with a lot of
lawyers. He said, ‘Son, these fellows charge fees you can't believe.‘ “

So Posner attended law school at the University of California at Berkeley,
where he was an honor student, then joined a prestigious Wall Street law firm,
leaving two years later to form his own firm.

In 1981 he represented Jewish victims of Dr. Josef Mengele, the notorious
Nazi war criminal whoa escaped from Germany after World War II and died in hiding
in South America.

"It waS a pro bono case, and I sued the Mengele family and the German
government," Posner said. "Nothing came of the suit, but I accumulated 25,000
documents about Mengele, so I thought I'd write a book."

“Mengele: The Complete Story," which he co-wrote with John Ware, was
published in 1986, prompting Posner to leave the law-and write full time.

“Case Closed" is his fifth book. "A weakness of mine is that I tend to
underestimate the difficulty of each project I undertake. This was true with
this book, but as I kept going I kept finding answers to things I didn't think [
could get answers to.°

The real cover-ups

Posner agrees with critics of the Warren Commission who say its investigation
was flawed.

"There was a cover-up by the FBI and the CIA, but they weren't attempting to

conceal their involvement in the murder of the president but rather. their own
inefficiency and bungling," Posner said. “I go into detail in exposing these

cover-ups, but they can't be interpreted as evidence of conspiracy."

The Warren Commission's work also was tarnished by a dubious finding of the
1978 investigation by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Posner said.

"The committee's acoustics experts tested a Dictabelt recording of radio
traffic on Dallas police channels. and said they were 95 percent certain there
had been a fourth shot, therefore a second shooter and a conspiracy."

A retest by the National Academy af Sciences discredited the committee's
experts, concluding that the recording was made a minute after the shooting,
Posner said.

Half of “Case Closed" is a meticulous examination of Oswald's entire life,
culminating in an almost day-by-day chronicle of his mavements in the last two
months before the assassination. “Many canspiracy books almost ignore Oswald.
But he's the key, and it's amazing how much is known about him," Posner said.
“It's certainly enough to disprove all the theories that he was a spy or a
patsy. .

"My technique was to go to original sources. Too many books quate secondary
sources, some of which are passing on misinformation, which means the garbage is
disseminated again and again, becoming fact.

“Here's an example. ‘ORK! opens with Rose Cheramie, a prostitute, warning her
doctors that the Kennedy assassination is going to take place in Dallas and
naming Ruby as involved. I found her doctor, who said she was psychatic and
didn't mention the assassination until the day after it happened or Ruby until
the day after he killed Oswald."

Posner paused. "I can go on."
