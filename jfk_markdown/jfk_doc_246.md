that th@( PSYCHOLOGICAL ASEESSWiNT ASSOCIATES) (see copy of SR
iT an 4 orandum dated 21.

_ Memoran dated 3-F.

‘as a result of a conversation between Mr. Howard OSBORNE,

Deputy Chief, SR Division, and Mr. Jack SOUTHARD, Chief, ccc /Nc.

3. <A meeting was called on 27 February 1961 to determine
the type of cover organization that should be substituted for
this purpose. After considering the matter a ength, it was
ascertained that the Agency has a cleared (emp. lyment) service in

(0 Pittsburgh) which could possibly be utilized as an initial q
assessment. This firm, the EMPLOYNENT SERVICE COMPANY, ?
is located in the Union Trust Buildi , Pittsburgh, Pennsyivania,) fo
and is managed by(argaret A. x LRIET) (see SSD File 95018).
It was agreed that if the(EMPLOYEHS SERVICE COMPANY could
provide the needed cover, two OTR psychologists’ would be docu-
mented in true name with that firm in(Pittsburglhio CcG (Frank
... O'MALIEY) will make a trip to(Pittsburgh),in the next few days
to determine whether Miss (AREY is amenable to the proposed
arrangement.d9 The two psychologist$ ‘'gelected were Doctors
BrADT and McKEE,on whom credit checks were recently completed

outside the Washington, D. C. area. Most of the training will
be conducted in an SR safe house in New York. The SR revresen-
tative will probably request a safe house in Baltimore for the
final assessment and processing of those REDSKIN Agents that

are cleared in the initial screening by either BRADT” or{iekEE} 06,
It should be noted at this point that SR Division plans to
process thirty or thirty-five REDSKIN Agents this year. Time
is, of course, of the essence, in view of the fact that these
people will have t- be assessed, security-cleared, briefed,

and trained, and arrangements for grants made before the sumer
season. °
